At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Booth, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you, sir. You may begin.","Mike Booth","Thank you, Jessie. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's second quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the investors section of incyte.com. I am joined on the call today by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks and by Dash who will join us for the Q&A session.","During the question-and-answer session, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and if needed one followup. This will enable as many of you to ask questions as time allows.","Before we begin however, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2019 guidance, the commercialization of our products and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline, as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2019, and from time to time, in our other SEC documents.","We'll now begin the call with Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. So at the beginning of 2019 we set out to achieve a series of specific goals and in the first half of the year we have already executed on a number of those commercial and clinical objectives. Q2 2019 was another strong quarter with 21% growth in total products and royalty revenue when compared to the same period last year. Sales of Jakafi grew by 18%, Iclusig revenues increased by 23% and Jakavi and Olumiant's royalties collectively demonstrated growth of 36%.","In May, we announced that the FDA granted full approval of Jakafi for use in patients with steroid refractory acute GVHD. Our team was pretty alert and we launched Jakafi in this new indication immediately. There were two additional important updates within our development portfolio during the second quarter. Capmatinib data in patients with non-small cell lung cancer harboring MET exon-14 skipping mutations were presented at ASCO and Novartis continues to guide to an NDA submission in this indication in the second half of this year. If approved, Incyte would become eligible for 12% to 14% royalties on global net sales by Novartis and could receive over $500 million in potential milestones over time.","Following our prior announcement of the Phase 2 trial of ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo has achieved its primary endpoint. The data was presented at the World Congress of Dermatology. The data was well received and we believe ruxolitinib cream has the potential to be transformative for the treatment of the millions of patients with vitiligo.","We are preparing for Phase 3 development in this indication which we expect to initiate by the end of this year. We therefore begin the second half of the year with strong momentum and we look forward to reporting on several other important clinical and regulatory milestones in the coming months.","One of Incyte's core strengths is our discovery engine. Several years ago, in order to capitalize on this we tasked a separate group of scientists to review potential uses for our molecular target outside of oncology. These efforts are now bearing fruit. In addition to our portfolio in hematology and oncology, we now have a separate and growing clinical portfolio in inflammation and autoimmunity indication.","As you know, we are currently running proof of concept trial across several molecules and indication and the two most advanced products within the IAI Group are the evaluation of ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. The data to date have been comparing in both indications and we look forward to future updates from ruxolitinib cream and as well as our proof of concept IAI program.","We believe that adding this exciting new potential growth driver on top of our well established oncology franchise could further accelerate and diversify our revenue line and better position Incyte for sustainable long term growth.","I will now turn the call over to Barry for an update on Jakafi.","Barry Flannelly","Thank you, Herv\u00e9 and good morning everyone. Patient demand for Jakafi continues to be strong. In the second quarter demand grew by 14% year-over-year while net sales grew by 18%. As a result of these encouraging results and given the early data from the launch in GVHD, we have increased the lower end of our guidance. Our full-year 2019 guidance for net sales of Jakafi is now $1.61 billion to $1.65 billion.","We are encouraged by the initial interest and excitement from healthcare professionals at bone morrow transplant centers across the nation as they learn about the approval of Jakafi for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory GVHD. The data supporting the approval has also been very well received. It is early to fully quantify the impact of GVHD launch and overall Jakafi performance, but indicators from BMT centers are good and we are seeing an increase in new GVHD patients on Jakafi.","For example, we have previously outlined the constrained nature of this opportunity which exists at a relatively small number of bone marrow transplant centers in the U.S. and our initial data indicate that over 80% of these top-tier centers have purchased Jakafi since FDA approval. Insurance coverage has also been encouraging and we are not aware of documented denials to date. And we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress over the coming quarters.","I'll now turn the call over to Steven for the clinical update.","Steven Stein","Thanks, Barry and good morning everyone. Incyte is currently running six key late-stage development projects. These have the potential to treat a significant number of patients across numerous indications. Ultimately, these projects aim to transform Incyte into a company with multiple approved products in the United States, Europe and Japan over the next several years. We have made good progress over the last few months and we remain on track to achieve the clinical milestones that we have previously laid out.","I'd now like to touch on two key data presentations made during the second quarter. In June, the Phase 2 data of ruxolitinib cream in patients with vitiligo were presented at the World Congress of Dermatology in Milan. As previously announced the trial achieved its primary endpoint of a facial VASI50 versus vehicle at week 24. Here you can see the improvements by dose over the course of the trial. The highest facial VASI50 scores were achieved using 1.5% ruxolitinib cream daily and twice daily. Importantly, ruxolitinib cream was well tolerated and was not associated with any clinically significant application site reactions or serious treatment related adverse events.","As you know, the facial VASI75 represents a more complete clinical response in patients with vitiligo and this is why we have chosen this as a primary endpoint in our global Phase 3 development plan. On this slide you will see the facial VASI75 data from our Phase 2 study. These data show a clear dose response and at the 1.5% dose of ruxolitinib cream used twice per day was the most effective in treating vitiligo lesions. Our plans for Phase 3 development are moving forward and we continue to expect the initiation of pivotal development before the end of this calendar year.","We intend to initiate two Phase 3 trials with 300 patients in each. The trials will evaluate ruxolitinib cream at a dose of 1.5% twice a day versus vehicle and our plan is to use facial VASI75 at 24 weeks as a primary endpoint of both studies. Note that at this dosing schedule in the Phase 2 trial 30% of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream achieved a facial VASI75 score whereas none of those patients treated with vehicle achieved a facial VASI75.","We are hopeful that ruxolitinib cream will be the first vitiligo therapy approved by the FDA and that it may provide these patients with a meaningful improvement in their disease. The vitiligo data are very important to Incyte. Ruxolitinib cream is a first-in-class agent with a potentially disease modifying mechanism of action in a large indication with a clear unmet need. The transformative effect of ruxolitinib cream could have in the treatment of vitiligo has therefore placed even greater momentum behind our IAI franchise and development efforts.","Let's move on to one of our out-licensed molecules, capmatinib, which has been developed by Novartis. At ASCO in June, updated data in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer harboring MET exon-14 skipping mutations from the GEOMETRY trail were presented. These data showed that almost all patients experienced reduction in tumor volume when treated with capmatinib and by RECIST these data showed overall response rate of 68% in first line patients and 41% in second and third line patients.","The data also showed a manageable safety profile. As a reminder, capmatinib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation and then Novartis expect to file an NDA by the end of this calendar year.","I'll end my update by reminding you about the expected key news flow events during 2019. We continue to expect to submit the NDA of pemigatinib in second line cholangiocarcinoma before the end of this year. We are also planning for the presentation of updated data on the FIGHT-202 trial which will form the basis for the NDA submission later this year. We have multiple Phase 3 trials running across various types of graft-versus-host disease and expected to deliver top line results by the end of this calendar year. REACH2 is evaluating ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease and REACH3 is studying ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease. Both of these trials are being conduction in collaboration with Novartis.","GRAVITAS-301 is evaluating itacitinib, our wholly-owned JAK1selective inhibitor in patients who are treatment na\u00efve acute graft versus host disease. If GRAVITAS-301 is positive, we would expect to seek approval for itacitinib in the United States, Europe and Japan based on these data. 2019 has been an excellent year of research and development execution thus far and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Christiana for a financial update.","Christiana Stamoulis","Thanks Steven, and good morning, everyone. The financial update this morning will include GAAP and non-GAAP numbers. For a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP, please refer to Slide 23 and 24 in the back half section of the deck and to the press release we issued this morning.","Turning now to Slide 17, our second quarter results reflect continued strong performance across all products with total product and royalty revenue of $510 million representing an increase of 21% over the second quarter of 2018. This is comprised of $410 million in Jakafi and $24 million in Iclusig net product revenues, $57 million in Jakafi royalties from Novartis and $19 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly. We also recognized $20 million in contract revenues under our collaboration agreement with Innovent resulting in total revenues for the quarter of $530 million.","Our total costs and expenses for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis of $379 million decreased 3% from the prior year quarter. Ongoing R&D expense for the quarter was $237 million on a non-GAAP basis representing a decrease of 7% from the prior year period. This decrease reflects the impact of our decision to stop co-funding baricitinib development and lower costs related to the epacadostat program partially offset by costs to advance our other internal development programs.","SG&A expense for the quarter of $93 million on a non-GAAP basis decreased 3% from the prior year quarter. This decrease reflects the timing of certain commercial activities which this year are expected to take place in the second half.","Moving to our guidance for 2019, we are increasing the low end of our Jakafi revenue guidance from $1.58 billion to $1.61 billion based on our results in the first half of the year. We are reiterating both R&D and SG&A expense guidance as we continue to invest in both our commercial efforts and in our clinical development portfolio.","I will now turn the call back to Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Christiana. So our next slide outlines our progress to date in 2019 as well as our remaining key news flow events we expect during 2019 including news from our partners. With this literally exciting latest program we are taking important steps toward our strategic goals of further diversifying the organization and driving sustainable revenue growth.","That concludes our prepared remarks and we are now happy to take your questions. Operator, please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, great. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions and also for such efficient scripted comments. I always appreciate it. So my first question is regarding GVHD. Can you just help us better understand the key gating items and levers that we need to think about with Jakafi's launch in this setting and should we be looking at this as a growth driver for the company in the near-term as more of a place setter for itacitinib? And then I have one followup.","Barry Flannelly","Sure Cory, this is Barry. Well as far as gating levers go, you know one of the most important things is access and we haven\u2019t had any problem with access at all. You know, it's early, but we really think the launch is going very well, both -- we have some qualitative and quantitative measures. Qualitatively we know that even centers that have been using Jakafi for GVHD before they might have been using it third or fourth line or even later, and now they've moved it up to second line.","Quantitatively, we know that orders from the 150 or so bone marrow transplant centers have increased. We don\u2019t always know exactly why they are ordering it, whether it is for MSPD [ph] or GVHD, but we can assume that most of the new orders are actually all for GVHD. We know that specialty distributor orders are up and those are generally as opposed to specialty pharmacy, specialty distributors shipped to hospitals and we know that those are up pretty substantially. We really think that with this year and I think I've said this before, of our top line net sales GVHD will account for about $80 million and that's spontaneous use as well as use once we have the approval.","Is it a growth driver? Pretty sure, it's a growth driver. As we get more data and new indications for Jakafi, but also ultimately for itacitinib as we gain approval in the first-line setting in both acute and chronic GVHD.","Cory Kasimov","Okay, that's very helpful Barry. And then my followup probably for Herv\u00e9, but I'd be interesting in getting your broader thoughts on and healthcare reform and all the noise that's out there, and to the extent there's something that's enacted that incorporates Part D, can you just remind us of your potential exposure there? Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","No, thanks for the question, and usually it's top of mind for many people, it's a situation Medicare sales for Jakafi in the U.S. I think we said are around 50% of our total business in the U.S. for Jakafi today. So that gives you an idea of the size of our Medicare exposure. The way we look at it is, first we know that there are a number of patients in the U.S. on Medicare who are not taking Jakafi because of the co-pays that they have to contribute today.","So the goal for us of any kind of reform is first to reduce the co-pay because it will be good for us, but also because of humanitarian reason I think it's one of the effects of current system in the U.S. is that there are number of people who cannot afford the co-pays the way it is defined today. So one of the good thing of what we have seen in the draft of the Senate document is a significant reduction in the co-pay for patients. It is very difficult for us to quantify what kind of effect it would have on the number of patients who could now afford to be treated with a product like Jakafi.","And it's not just Jakafi, I mean it's really touching all cancer treatment in general and we think it will be a huge positive for these patients as the co-pay is reduced. And frankly we wish it would be further reduced. I mean, the counterpart of that would be for us the contribution to the catastrophic coverage and the net-net of the two frankly is difficult to quantify.","What we think, what I think personally is that as we move forward for the next 10 years, you know, for a company like us with innovative products coming to market over the next 10 years, the fact that patients part of the payments for this innovative treatment is reduced is fundamentally a very good thing because it will give excess to more people in the U.S.","Cory Kasimov","All right, perfect. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Abrahams","Hi there, thanks so much for taking my questions. I wanted to drill down a little bit more on the Phase 3 vitiligo trial design. Chris, if you could talk a little more about what shape your choice of endpoints there for the Phase 3, the F-VASI75, whether that was driven by regulatory feedback or more about meaningfulness to patients, how we should be thinking about timelines and potential timelines for enrollment there? And then what your goal would be for potentially maximizing this differentiation versus other topicals from those studies? Thanks.","Steven Stein","Brain, hi it's Steven. Thanks for your questions. So re the Phase 3 design and the primary endpoint and whether it is regulatory or patient driven or both, as you can see, as you set the bar higher as regards VASI scores, whether it is 25%, 50% or 75% obviously the relative percent gained in achieving the efficacy endpoint is somewhat lower. But it is meaningfulness right? So once you get up to 75% re-pigmentation you are proving to regulators that you've achieved something meaningful as well as to patients, so it's both in that regard and it is both driven by discussions with regulators and obviously taking patient input into regard.","You'll see the \u2013 the vehicle response rate is zero at that time at 24 weeks. What we expect and what we know from the cream and how it behaves is over time actually these numbers go up. So remember this study actually goes on for a total of two years. We will eventually have 52-week data and data beyond that and there is every expectation given the way it works in the natural course of this disease that those numbers will increase over time at 52 weeks and beyond. So it is a bit of both and it will set a standard for future studies in terms of achieving that endpoint.","In terms of timelines, again I'll just be repetitive, the vehicle response rate is zero, so we don\u2019t require a great deal of patients to conduct these studies. We require two studies as per the regulations, but there are only 300 patients each given the very low to zero vehicle response rate. So we're looking to enroll 600 patients. I expect it will enroll quickly. We just can't give you exact timelines at this juncture.","Differentiation wise, we know from the atopic dermatitis program that, and that has extensive now patient numbers in the exposure data that the cream is extremely well-tolerated. In atopic dermatitis there is resolution of\u2013 of the itch in 48 hour or less. There is no burning on application. So, you know we have \u2013 as long as we achieve the efficacy we fully expect from our Phase 2 program we have a differentiated profile from a tolerability point of view. Thanks.","Brian Abrahams","That's really helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Carter Gould with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Carter Gould","Great, good morning. Congrats on the quarter. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe one for Steven, just digging in a little bit more on to GRAVITAS-301, just kind of wondering around kind of your assumption and the importance of showing a separation on non-relapse mortality when you think about sort of the target product profile and as we think about that Phase 3 readout? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Carter, hi, Steven, thanks for your question. So GRAVITAS-301 for everybody else is itacitinib and steroid naive acute graft-versus-host disease. It has two very important endpoints; the overall response rate as well as non-relapse mortality. So that's - that's due to anything other than disease relapse, so either infections or progression of graft versus host disease. In terms of the primary endpoint and overall response rate, the study is powered to show a 16% or greater increase in overall response rate that's public and we've made that available.","In terms of non-relapse mortality, it's a 40% relative reduction in non-relapse mortality at six months, and that we fully expect from our enabling proof of concept data to achieve both those endpoints. We need to achieve both to get the study across the finish line and work towards a submission for both. So those are the endpoints we aim for, the proof of concept data easily exceeded those, so we have room to move.","Carter Gould","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Salveen Richter","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. So with regard to your Phase 3 topical ruxolitinib trial in atopic dermatitis that's reading out next year, the study ongoing is in adults with surface area limits. Can you just help us to understand the market targeted by this study and when you look at the adult population versus the pediatric population and then your plans for studying pediatric patients given you have a Phase 1 study ongoing? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Yes. Salveen . Hi, thanks for your question. So you're correct, the current program looks at patients 12 years and above and that it covers mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis and that covers the vast majority of patients suffering from the condition.","We do want to eventually, once we achieve adequate safety data to enable the work study younger patients, but we need to first prove that there is no issue in terms of safety in that population. But as I said, it doesn't represent the majority of the patients there.","The body surface limits are just somewhat practical in nature. Remember we are applying a cream and that you just can't apply it to the entire body, but again this encompasses patients with a majority of atopic dermatitis and we are comfortable with the way the program is set up. Thanks. ","Salveen Richter","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Marc Frahm with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Marc Frahm","Hi, yes. Thanks. One thing that wasn't touched on in the regulatory or in the recent R&D update, it's maybe - could you touch on the essential thrombocythemia kind of enrollment update or trying to maybe cut the trial off and get a publication out that could support something like guideline inclusion? And then, given the fact that those have been kind of going slower than expected, but were part of long-term guidance, do you need to update that long-term guidance for Jakafi?","Steven Stein","Hi, Marc, hi, it's Steven. I'll do the first part and then I'll ask Barry to address the -- contribution to guidance. So, you are correct and we said this on numerous calls that given the eligibility criteria required to get onto the study in that patients have to have a high white cell count and be post hydroxyurea and then be further randomized to either ruxolitinib or anagrelide, it hasn't been an easy study to enroll at all and we said, you know it's taken longer than expected. So we are very much considering whether as you said, this should be changed more into a publication strategy. We are currently working with the regulatory authorities on another amendment that may help enrollment and that's allow prior anagrelide and we'll see if that will help enrollment or not. It's too early to tell in terms of that.","Remember, the vast majority of patients with essential thrombocythemia are controlled with hydroxyurea, so it was really always for the patients who weren't in that space. It's the last myeloproliferative neoplasm that we don't have an indication for. We know from spontaneous use, anecdotal reports and others, that the drug has efficacy there and that's why we conducted the Phase 3 program, but it could well be turned more into a publication [indiscernible] Elistin [ph] top strategy.","I'll ask Barry to answer your next question.","Barry Flannelly","Hi, Marc. So we're very confident in our long-term guidance of $2.5 billion to $3 billion. We - even without ET, but as Steven said, we do have some spontaneous use of Jakafi for patients with ET. I think that will continue, but the vast majority of sales really come from continued growth in MF, PV and GVHD.","Marc Frahm","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Michael Schmidt with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi guys, this is Kelcy [ph] on for Michael. Thanks for taking our questions. First, so we've heard from physicians that patients stay on Jakafi for a pretty long time. I guess, in this context, how could the potential approval of fedratinib in the coming months maybe affect Jakafi patient duration? And then secondly, we were just hoping if you could provide a little more color on the FGFR tumor agnostic program, maybe just kind of remind us what bar needs to be cleared with that data set to potentially warrant an agnostic label? Thanks so much.","Barry Flannelly","So thanks, Kelcy, this is Barry. I'll take the first part of the question and hand it over to Steven for the second part of the question. So for the potential launch of fedratinib, we believe that patients will continue to stay on therapy as long as they benefit from Jakafi which is both in MF and PV quite a long time.","So I think that's the most important thing is that patients get the most benefit out of Jakafi before they move on to something else. As far as the efficacy and safety of Jakafi as compared to other JAK inhibitors including fedratinib we're very confident that Jakafi is the best-in-class drug and that patients should start on Jakafi before they move on to something else. So we don't think it's really going to affect as much at all. Steven?","Steven Stein","Thanks, Barry. Thanks for the question. So this is a very important part of the pemigatinib program. So remember the cholangiocarcinoma study is complete. We expect to file in the second half of this year. The bladder cancer work is ongoing and should complete enrollment also second half of this year and hopefully would be part of a submission next year. And then the third pillar here is the tumor agnostic program.","We also have an ongoing effort in a very rare myeloproliferative neoplasm that's driven by FGFR 1 chromosome 8p11 translocation. But in terms of the tumor agnostic program, you're right the -- there is, you can't be specific in terms of a bar, but let me just give you a sense of some of the tumors.","If you look at endometrial carcinoma, is about 10% of those patients that have FGFR two mutations or fusions. Glioblastoma is also about 10% for FGFR 3, squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer about 5%, FGFR mutations or fusions rectal cancer about 2%, and squamous cell head and neck also about 2%. All of those are allowed to come on the program. The guidance from regulators to date has been, if you already have an indication, you have an established drug that hits -- an oncogene has already been shown to work and at that juncture will have cholangiocarcinoma and hopefully bladder cancer as well, then there is obviously precedent in the most recent ones probably checkpoint blockade with MSI-high tumors with checkpoint blockade they got an indication.","In terms of de novo indications there is obviously NRTK inhibitors now that are given across the board where the histology is agnostic. So you need to see reasonable response rates that are durable. Some of those tumors I mentioned, you would require a higher number than glioblastoma for example, where there is a lot of unmet need.","So it would be a little bit on case-by-case basis. As long as the genetic mutation is a driver, the drug hits that driver mutation and causes a response rate that's durable, we expect with the cumulative data set to possibly get a tumor agnostic indication there. The opportunity from a patient point of view, actually if you add all those up, becomes bigger than the whole for all the other tumor types. So it's a very, very important program to us.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great, sounds really helpful. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Harrison","Great, good morning, thanks for taking the question. I guess, I wanted to ask about GRAVITAS-301as well, but more on the commercial side, could you just talk, I guess two parts here, could you talk a little bit about, given that there are a bunch of cheap generics available, what sort of efficacy differential do you think you need to be able to achieve to have solid pricing premium there and uptake? And then just briefly comment on what sort of sales force expansion, you think you need to have to maximize the syndication? Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","I'll let Steven start off with the beginning, and then I'll pick up on the sales force and potential for the drug.","Steven Stein","So, Matthew, let me just go back to your important question around endpoints in GRAVITAS-301. We spoke about them briefly earlier. So remember, there are two important endpoints. There is the overall response rate at day-28 and then there is non-relapse mortality and obviously this is a steroid naive acute graft versus host disease. So it's a combination of itacitinib and steroids versus steroids alone and you alluded to steroids being a cheap generic, and that's exactly why the studies conducted and powered to show an appreciable difference in both.","So just let me remind you on the overall response rate, we need to see a 16% absolute improvement in response rate or better and then it has to be coupled with six months in non-relapse mortality that was relatively speaking 40% or better to get both to justify the use of a JAK inhibitor in addition to steroids and that population. I'll ask Barry to address your commercial question.","Barry Flannelly","So with the endpoints that Steven laid out, I don't think there will be much of a problem getting premium pricing at least compared to generics like steroids, if that's what you're implying. Non-relapse mortality is a significant endpoint and again I think we'll be able to have an adequate price for this drug.","As far as the sales force goes, in the in the United States we mostly have it covered to be honest. We might have expansions for other drugs that are coming, including itacitinib and pemigatinib that we'll think about in a little bit, but in Europe and Japan, then we will need to have a sales force that increases to certain amount.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Yes, just a word on Europe, in fact we did, we did the calculation recently and the Iclusig sales force that we have today there is in fact very much targeting that same centers that are doing bone marrow transplant. So there would be some increase, but it would be relatively marginal regarding the European side.","And in Japan, we would love to have itacitinib in GVHD as our first product to launch in hematology, because again the number of centers is relatively limited compared to the overall need for sales force in hematology. And it would be something that would be feasible with a number of reps, of commercial people that is really small compared to the traditional Japanese sales force that you need for oncology.","So Europe, we are almost there. So there is a marginal increase. And Japan it would be very reasonable. So it's an indication for us that would be a driver of the top line growth, but would be also very good contributor to the bottom line.","Mike Booth","We can get the next question please?","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Alethia Young with Cantor Fitzgerald. Please proceed with your question.","Alethia Young","Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress. I just wanted to go to the PI3-kinase. I know you have data coming next year and obviously there is some PI3-kinase as they're starting to emerge again. So I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on how you're thinking about what the reasonable profile for this drug could be and kind of some of your thoughts heading into the data in 2020? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Alethia hi, Steven. Thanks for your question. In terms of the PI3-kinase delta program in lymphomas, I'll also remind you by the way, we have the RUX combo ongoing in myeloproliferative neoplasms as well, particularly MF. But in terms of lymphomas, which I think is the meat of your question there are three registration directed approaches. One is against follicular lymphoma, the other against mantle cell and the third one against marginal zone lymphoma. They are all enrolling really well. They will complete enrollments in the second half of this year. We'll get data, as you alluded to in 2020 and we expect, based on activity we've seen to date high response rates that are durable. And then each of their own will be submitted as potential indications.","There is a potential to lump together lower grade lymphomas. So you could do follicular and marginal zone together for example. Mantle cell is probably standalone. There is a crowded space as you alluded to in terms of mechanism of action, there are BTK inhibitors, BCL2 inhibitors, CAR-T therapies, et cetera, but all those conditions remain incurable. All have unmet need attached and we've seen regulators even more willing lately in areas of unmet need to approve additional agents. So we remain confident in the approach, thus far.","And there will probably be more in the accelerated approval, conditional approval camp. So you will likely see should the datasets justify them confirmatory studies being set up more likely combination work, but that's the entirety of the program. All the data on those studies in 2020. Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","And just, sorry, just a quick followup on that. As far as safety goes, I mean do you think that's what really is going to differentiate, I mean kind of what have you been doing there with those and kind of help with that as well? Thanks.","Steven Stein","Yes, Alethia I think you're right. We took a timeline hit because of that. We did some very careful work with scheduling and dosing because we knew the drug is highly active, even B-cell tumors literally melt away with PI3-Kinase delta inhibition, but in the long-term toxicity particularly colitis. So we looked at induction daily dosing for eight weeks and then switching to weekly, and then we looked at induction daily dosing for 20 milligrams daily for eight weeks and switching to lower dose daily, and we've done a lot of work in that regard.","It looks like both of those schedule and dose changes ameliorate the safety profile quite substantially. For example, we see little to no colitis at this date, at this juncture. We still have to wait for the complete dataset. I think it's likely at this juncture that you'll see, this 20 milligram daily for eight week induction to get the maximum effect, maximum response, and then likely switch to lower dose daily dosing of like 2.5 daily, and that should get us to the therapeutic ratio we desire and you alluded to, because it will be critical. You'll have to hit that efficacy bar and then have tolerable safety profile. Thanks.","Alethia Young","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tyler Van Buren with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Tyler Van Buren","Great, thanks guys. Good to see all the progress over the course of the quarter. I had a question with respect to REACH3in chronic GVHD that we'll see by the end of the year, much like you did for GRAVITAS-301 where you spoke about the parameters for overall response rate and non-relapse mortality, could you speak about the powering assumptions or what you need to achieve for success in REACH3 and your comfort with what we will see on best available therapy and what you would expect it to show?","Steven Stein","Sure. Thank you. It's Steven. So, we haven't given out the statistical analysis plan powering assumptions for REACH2 and REACH3 like we have for GRAVITAS-301, but I can talk to the meat of your question. Remember both REACH2 and REACH3 are randomized against best available therapies. It's not wide open. There is a specific list for each trial that's available on the clinical trials carve listing [ph]. For REACH3 best available therapy in chronic include therapies like extracorporeal photopheresis, low dose methotrexate, mycophenolate, M2 inhibitors and a few others including BTK inhibitors.","So you are correct. I mean the study has to beat those best available therapies. We know from our - again our proof of concept data with ruxolitinib in the setting that we get higher response rate that's what's been published to date with best available therapies. All those therapies I mentioned while not approved have had Phase 2 studies done and shown 30% to 50% response rates. But in totality, we'll have to beat the response and the durability for the response, but we haven't shared the powering assumptions publicly yet. Thanks.","Tyler Van Buren","Okay, thanks. So just as a followup on REACH2, is there any kind of, I guess what incremental data in that study do you think is most important to continue to facilitate uptake of Jakafi in that setting?","Steven Stein","I'll talk from a clinical perspective. I don\u2019t know if Barry will want to add anything afterwards. The -- again it's different from REACH1. REACH1was a single arm study. You've seen the data and as I've already said we got a full approval from the FDA on that data set. So it's actually nothing more required in the U.S. from a regulatory point of view for REACH1.","But obviously, this is an important dataset that will be randomized against best available therapy. We will get a sense of what the response rate is in that randomized setting with Novartis. They'll be using that globally for a file in steroid refractory acute and we'll get a sense of the safety versus best available therapy. But I don't expect to see a different data set in terms of response or durability of response that we've seen from REACH1 and we actually don't need it from a regulatory point of view. From Barry, if you want to add anything?","Barry Flannelly","Yes. No. Obviously so what Steven said it's another solid data set that for those people that might still have some hesitation, BMT, healthcare professionals that might have some hesitation about introducing a drug like Jakafi it will just give them more confidence that in fact this is an important drug to be used in the treatment of this devastating disease.","Tyler Van Buren","Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer with Evercore. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Schimmer","Hey, thanks for taking two quick questions, first, can you quantify how much of the Jakafi quarter-over-quarter growth came from MF versus PV versus GVHD versus improvement in gross to net? And then on that topical franchise I get asked a lot whether topical drugs can be premium priced, if so, what kind of price band are you thinking that would account for both a vitiligo indication which is less common and for atopic dermatitis indication that might be more common? Thanks.","Steven Stein","Sure. So, Josh. Thanks for the question. So for the quarter, so MF continues to be, if there is about 14,000 patients in any given quarter MF accounts for about 7,000 patients, PV accounts for about 5,000 patients, and others is about 2000 patients in any given quarter.","So, the growth, so new patients in total patients for MF grew quarter-over-quarter, for PV grew quarter-over-quarter, for other grew quarter-over-quarter and we can't always break that out for GVHD. How much was accounted for in gross to net was 4% quarter-over-quarter. So, as you know the gross to net in the first quarter has the biggest impact and then it gets better in the second quarter. As far as premium price, I'll turn it over to Herv\u00e9 and see if he has some comments.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","So, the situation is the following, is that we have a Phase 3 ongoing, two Phase 3 ongoing in atopic dermatitis with two different concentration being compared to a placebo. So vehicle versus two different concentrations, so that would read in 2020 somewhere next year and we are initiating the vitiligo Phase 3 study. So your comment is -- your question is really about the pricing, is the pricing identical between two indications where for one of them vitiligo we have a first-in-class disease modifying effect, and another atopic dermatitis where there is a fair amount of competition.","I think it's important to remember that the duration of treatments are very, very different between the two indications. You heard from Steven that the vitiligo the 24-week data that has been published is one aspect, but the 52 weeks. If the trend continues, we'll show that the duration of treatment should go beyond 24 weeks, where in fact the treatment in atopic dermatitis is in many cases just a few weeks per year if you look at it over a 52 weeks period. So this entire pricing question is not resolved yet. We need to have more data point to be able to make the right decision between the two indications and the different concentrations, and frankly, it will be something that will be done probably during the -- when we see the data in atopic dermatitis.","Can we have a premium price on the topical formulation is an excellent question. I frankly believe looking at the Vitiligo data that is accumulating that there is a case to be made about the economic value of this topical ruxolitinib formulation, because it is frankly giving a level of efficacy that is better than what we can see from the data we have, what we can see with alternative treatments that are in fact fairly expensive, so there is, there is a value case that could be made around the vitiligo indication.","Josh Schimmer","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Stephen Willey with Stifel. Please proceed with your question.","Stephen Willey","Yes, good morning, thanks for taking the question. Just a quick question on Jakafi guidance and then one for Steven. It looks like the high-end of the new range implies, I think less than 4% sequential growth going forward. Just want to make sure that there is nothing implied in there from a discounting or headwind perspective?","Barry Flannelly","This is Barry. Thanks, Stephen. So, no, there is no discounting. We think that the low end of the guidance is 16% growth year-over-year in net sales. The high-end guidance is 19% growth year-over-year. We're confident by lowering the lower end of our guidance that will come in at the upper end of our guidance.","Stephen Willey","Got it. And then maybe just quickly for Steven, is it your expectation that the competitive landscape of FGFR inhibitors including pemigatinib are going to have shared mechanisms of acquired resistance?","Steven Stein","Yes, it's a good question. There is obviously erdafitinib approved now in bladder cancer. We should be the first in cholangiocarcinoma, but there other inhibitors out there. They all have slightly different profiles in terms of the specificity and whether they are more promiscuous for other receptors. And because of that the resistant profile that may ultimately emerge may be different for each of them. It's just too early to know. I mean, we are highly encouraged the collection of biopsy and sequencing of patients that have progression it is just not that easy to do.","And if you witness historically other diseases, I mean, take chronic myeloid leukemia with the introduction of tyrosine kinase inhibitors there you got the entity of T315I mutations forming which is a new disease for which a drug like ponatinib works. Right?","So, you will see what develops. We just don't know at the moment what the resistant mutation profile will look like for our drug versus the others. I suspect there may be slight differences because each of the agents it's slightly different receptors upfront, can't give you more at the moment.","Stephen Willey","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Peter Lawson with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Lawson","Thanks for taking the questions. Just on pemigatinib, just how should we think about the durability you would need to see in the pan tumor setting, should we think about that as kind of individual case-by-cases or can we kind of think about it as a collective durability?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Sorry, we just, yes, we have Steven.","Steven Stein","Sorry Peter, we've got a microphone issue for a second. So, just in cholangiocarcinoma first then I'll talk about the pan-tumor thing. Remember it's a second line study. The standard of care currently is chemotherapy with 10% to 15% response rate and very short progression-free survival of a few months.","So in that setting, versus that we would have to beat the response rate and then the progression-free survival data. Pan-tumor wise as I said, if you look at the different entities, endometrial carcinoma, glioblastoma, you're going to have different progression-free survival durability that you need to see and each one will be a case-by-case to get to the point you made. It's just hard to comment now. Thanks.","Peter Lawson","And just a followup on the PI3K, the dose changes and intermittent scheduling, do you think that kind of hinders the potential uptake in what could be a crowded marketplace in follicular and MZL?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","I think it's a good question. You know, we did toy with purely scientific data driven with weekly dosing, which may or may not have had a compliance issue. But as it turns out, it's looking like and we'll have to back this up with data in the future, that it will still be daily dosing and it will just be a different dose. So it will be a 20 milligram induction for 8 weeks, followed by a lower daily dose.","So there is not going to be a scheduling issue that I think will hinder uptake. I think what we're doing with the higher dose induction is the right thing because most - just about all the responses take place in the first eight to nine weeks. So you maximize your response and then you scale back to still hold the tumor and check but manage the tolerability. I don't see an uptake issue with that.","Peter Lawson","Great, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from the line of Evan Seigerman with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Evan Seigerman","Hi, all, thank you for taking the question and congrats on the progress. One on pemigatinib, so can you just remind us of the opportunity in cholangiocarcinoma? And more broadly, how do you compete against J&J and the potential bladder cancer opportunity? And then one for Christiana, you had mentioned that you have some ability to potentially do some BD [ph], can you remind us of your estimated capacity and how this could potentially fit into the strategic priorities of Incyte? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Yes, Evan, thanks it's Steven. I'll go first. So if you look at the cholangiocarcinoma opportunity intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma, about 13% to 20% of patients have FGFR2 translocations. So we estimate about 2000 to 3,000 addressable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma patients in major markets globally with that particular mutation and we should be first there. You're right that J&J erdafitinib has the indication in bladder first. This is probably about 15,000 patients globally with the FGFR3 mutation there, but just a few issues.","So we'll see. If you look at their label in terms of tolerability obviously they hit the efficacy bar they wanted, but in tolerability they have, as I said upfront to different profile in terms of hitting different receptors and they did have an ocular tolerability issue of around 20% to 25%. We'll see if we are able to compete there in a better way and that we will achieve the efficacy desired, but have a better tolerability profile. So that's one way of differentiating as long as you have the efficacy.","And then, it terms of lifecycle management, we have different approaches going forward on what is needed from a confirmatory study point of view. And you'll see we will be, and it's already up on clinical trials out doing the first-line study in bladder cancer and they are not. So that's one other way should that work, we will differentiate and potentially get a jump on the market there.","Christiana Stamoulis","Hi Evan, it's Christiana. I'll take the question on the BD [ph]. First of all, as we have previously discussed, our focus is on diversification and long-term growth. So when you look at our internal pipeline late-stage pipeline is shaping up very nicely to help us achieve that objective. At the same time, we have $1.7 billion as of the end of June of cash on our balance sheet and that gives us the ability to opportunistically look at BD supplement our internal activities. So when we look at BD it would be in line with the same corporate objective of adding to diversification on the top line and driving long-term growth and focus more on the mid-term type of timeline.","Evan Seigerman","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from the line of Jay Olson with Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Jay Olson","Well, hey, congrats on the quarter and thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to follow up on pemigatinib. I think you said you would submit NDA filing later this year. I was wondering if you were going to present an updated cut of the Phase 2 cholangiocarcinoma data later in the year and also could you comment on which sales force you would use to promote pemigatinib, would that be your Jakafi sales force, and can you just talk about the overlap there?","Steven Stein","So Jay, it's Steven. You're correct, the pemigatinib files, we have the data, we have it in hand, we are presently preparing the submission and will go in the second half of this year in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma that has the FGFR2 mutation. With that, although we can't give you the exact meeting, but there'll be an oral presentation of the data at a meeting in the second half of this year that will be, have the content of what's in the NDA with that as well.","Barry Flannelly","Yes and so Jay it's Barry. So we're still working on exactly how we're going to roll out the sales force next year to support pemigatinib, but it will add a few people to our 120 sales reps that we currently have and we'll keep basically the same number of FTEs and MF, PV and GVHD and have a certain number of FTEs that are dedicated to the promotion of pemigatinib. You know that in fact hematologists and oncologists throughout the United States, basically treat everything at least in the community setting. So we're really calling on many of the same offices today as we will with pemigatinib.","Jay Olson","Great, thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. We have one final question coming from the line of Andrew Berens with SVB Leerink. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Berens","Hi, thanks, good morning guys. So I have a question or a couple of questions on the GVHD franchise and then maybe I could sneak one in on the derm franchise too. I was wondering with Jakafi approval in GVHD has there been any changes to the formulary treatment of Jakafi? And then also I was just wondering if itacitinib is approved in the frontline setting, how does that change the opportunity for Jakafi in the refractory setting?","Barry Flannelly","Hi, this is Barry, Andrew. So in fact for does it change anything for acceptance and access for patients and Jakafi with GVHD. No, I mean, we've always had great access from the payers for Jakafi for PV and MF, and as far as we can tell in the launch, we've really have had no restrictions whatsoever. Many of the insurers actually have no utilization management for Jakafi in GVHD. Whether they'll write them in the future or not, we don\u2019t know.","But generally speaking, patients with getting bone marrow transplants have access to all drugs. As far as it itacitinib goes, we think that itacitinib it's going to be used in first-line setting. We think it's going to help many patients in that setting for both acute and chronic GVHD. We do think that both of the drugs can live together, but obviously itacitinib will have worldwide, and that will be very important to us to launch in countries around the world. So, will patients get ruxolitinib after they get itacitinib, it's certainly possible.","Andrew Berens","Okay, thanks. And then maybe just the question on the derm franchise is for Herv\u00e9, I'm just wondering how you're thinking about developing that opportunity outside the U.S.?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thanks. Yes, what we said in the past, is that the case is getting more and more convincing on the U.S. side too obviously for us to book the sales, to diversify our portfolio, to do promotion and a lot of the commercial work in the U.S., our self. As the size of the required is really this study the question is still very much open for the rest of the world.","I think you can imagine, Asia is a part of the world where we would probably benefit from having a partner and the question about Europe is really 50-50 at this point. We are looking at different options of collaboration that could help us, and we have time before we make that decision because we will get the atopic dermatitis, there let's say midyear and the fighting in the in the second half of the year. So from thereto European approvals there will be another 12 months at least. So we are basically two years away from the - at least from the launch in Europe, probably more. And we want to take that time to have a full understanding of the financial and strategic implication of that decision for Europe.","Andrew Berens","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer session. So I'd like to pass the floor back over to Herv\u00e9 for any additional concluding comments.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","So thank you all for your time today and for your questions. So we look forward to seeing you at upcoming investor and medical conferences, but for now we thank you again for your participation in the call today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Jacob. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's first quarter 2017 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com. I'm joined on the call today by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Steven, Dave and Reid. We'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2017 guidance, the commercialization of our products and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners.","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2016 and from time to time in our other SEC documents.","I'd now like to pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for his introductory remarks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. So, obviously, we have had a very busy beginning to 2017, which included both a number of very exciting development and one rather disappointing one. I'd now walk you through some high-level comments on each of these in the next few minutes. Firstly, and very importantly, sales of Jakafi for the first quarter were 37% higher than in the first quarter of 2016 and the primary driver of the strong growth is the growing number of patients on therapy. Also, on the positive side, our product-related revenue, which includes Jakafi and Iclusig sales by Incyte and royalties we receive from Jakafi and Olumiant, showed robust growth of 43% year-on-year.","Let me now turn to the recent baricitinib update. In February, the European Commission approved baricitinib as Olumiant for the treatment of patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. It has since been launched by Lilly in Europe, with what we consider to be a strong lever, and in Q1, we recognized the first royalties on European sales.","Last month, and with Lilly, we announced some not-so-bright news when the FDA issued a complete response letter for baricitinib for the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis. This will delay any potential U.S. approval of baricitinib versus our original assumption, which was for approval on the April PDUFA date. The CRL indicated that additional clinical data are needed to determine the most appropriate dosage and to further characterize safety concern across treatment arm. We expect that Lilly will now engage with the FDA to discuss the Agency's concern and determine the potential path forward.","We remain confident in the benefit\/risk of baricitinib as the new potential treatment option for adults with RA and intend to support the development of baricitinib with Lilly in RA and subsequent indication. Dave will provide more color on the financial impact that this delay to any potential U.S. approval of baricitinib is expected to bring, including the most conservative outlook on the timing of any future milestone payments from Lilly.","The selling for baricitinib in the U.S. is obviously a disappointment, but we do not believe it changes the fundamental momentum and direction at Incyte, which has been driven by strong growth in product-related revenue as well as the significant expansion of our clinical activities across many parts of our development portfolio.","A month or so ago, we were excited to announce the plans to expand our clinical collaborations with Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb for epacadostat on their respective PD-1 inhibitors. With Merck, we intend to open pivotal programs in four additional tumor types; and with BMS, we intend to open pivotal programs in two tumor types. We look forward to showing some of the data driving this go-forward decision with you next month at ASCO in Chicago and to our planned opening of the studies later in 2017.","Within our targeted portfolio, we have shared first in line data from our FGFR1\/2\/3 inhibitor, 828 at AACR in April. Recall that this compound is currently in three Phase 2 trials for bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and 8p11 MPNs. Also, we recently dosed our first patient in CITADEL-202, which will evaluate our PI3K inhibitor \u2013 PI3K delta inhibitor, 465, in patients with relapsed or refractory DLBCL. Additional trials in the CITADEL program evaluating 465 in other non-Hodgkin lymphoma are planned. And lastly, the pivotal program of ruxolitinib in patients with essential thrombocythemia is expected to begin soon. And so, itacitinib, our selective JAK1 inhibitor, a pivotal program for treatment-na\u00efve GVHD is on track begin later in 2017.","On slides 6 offers an additional opportunity to review the progress we have made and the preparations we are already making for our long-term success at Incyte. In February, it was announced that Incyte would be joining the S&P 500 Index, which is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. I believe that our inclusion in the S&P 500 is an excellent demonstration of the significant recent growth across many parts of our business.","During the first quarter, we also closed three transactions investing over $200 million in upfront and milestone payment to secure or amended collaboration with Merus, Calithera and Agenus, which we believe will be very important for the long-term success of Incyte.","With that, I'll pass the call to Barry for an update on Jakafi.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. We have seen strong growth in demand for Jakafi over the past few years. We exited the first quarter with approximately 10,000 patients being treated with Jakafi. A number of that has grown annually by almost 40% since the first quarter of 2014. After more than five years since the initial FDA approval, we are pleased to see continued robust growth in total patient numbers.","Sales of Jakafi continue to perform well. Jakafi revenue for the first quarter of 2017 was $251 million, a 37% increase over the first quarter of 2016 and a 6% increase over the fourth quarter of 2016. Performance in the first quarter was driven primarily by strong demand growth at 6% over Q4. As expected, we experienced a typical and seasonal increase in gross-to-net in the first quarter. And Q1 also saw a normalization of inventory levels. We exited 2016 at the lower end of a normal range and has exited Q1 at a higher end of the normal range with about three weeks of Jakafi in inventory.","We are proud of the clinical benefits that Jakafi provides to patients with myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera, and we are continuing to invest in the clinical development of ruxolitinib. The pivotal program of ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD is already underway. If the REACH1 trial is successful, we plan to submit an sNDA seeking accelerated approval of ruxolitinib for the treatment of patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD during 2018.","We also intend to open a pivotal program studying ruxolitinib for the second-line treatment of patients with essential thrombocythemia. While most patients are treated in the first-line setting with hydroxyurea, we believe that ruxolitinib may benefit patients with ET after treatment with hydroxyurea. The prevalence of ET in the U.S. is approximately 80,000 patients and approximately 8,000 patients may be eligible for second-line therapy.","With that, pass the call along to Steven for clinical update.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Barry, and good morning. Our ECHO clinical development program, evaluating epacadostat, continues to advance as well as to expand. We initiated the ECHO-301 Phase 3 trial of epacadostat in combination with pembro in patients with unresectable or advanced melanoma a little less than a year ago and the trial has been recruiting very well. The collaborative effort with Merck has been very successful and enrollment target numbers for ECHO-301 have recently been reached at most investigator sites. Sites in Japan remain open for recruitment in that portion of the study.","During the last year, we predicted that towards the end of 2016, we would be in a position to make go\/no-go decisions on new Phase 3 programs for epacadostat, and with the maturation of the data, we are now moving ahead in multiple new pivotal programs. As previously announced, we expect to initiate six pivotal studies in four tumor types with Merck, and we expect to initiate two pivotal programs with BMS. Pending regulatory feedback, we hope to initiate these programs by the end of this calendar year.","Next month, we look forward to the presentation of multiple cohorts of Phase 2 epacadostat data at ASCO in Chicago. The data sets from the ECHO-202 of epacadostat in combination with pembro contain approximately 30 to 40 patients per tumor type. And of these, the bladder and head and neck cancer cohorts will be oral presentation, and the non-small cell lung cancer and renal cancer cohorts will be highlighted in poster discussions. The pooled safety data from across the ECHO-202 study will also be a poster discussion. The ECHO-204 trial of epacadostat in combination with nivo will also be an oral presentation and will include efficacy data from several, but not all of the tumor types being studied in the ECHO-204.","Other presentations of Incyte compounds at ASCO will include CITADEL-101 which is evaluating our PI3 kinase delta inhibitor, 50465, in relapsed or refractory B-cell malignancy as well as early clinical data from 1158, our recently in-licensed arginase inhibitor.","We've made good clinical development progress so far in 2017, and slide 14 shows the full portfolio. Two pivotal trials, REACH1 and REACH2, for ruxolitinib and acute graft-versus-host disease are already underway. And another, REACH3, in chronic graft-versus-host disease is expected to begin later this year. We also expect to start the pivotal studies of ruxolitinib in essential thrombocythemia and of itacitinib in treatment-na\u00efve acute graft-versus-host disease in the coming months.","Beyond the ECHO-301 trial in melanoma, we expect to start at least eight new pivotal trials of epacadostat plus PD-1 inhibitors across all different tumor types. This generates a total of at least 14 pivotal trials, either in progress or planned for the coming months.","One additional update to the portfolio is that following 24 weeks of treatment with our topical formulation of ruxolitinib, we have determined that data from the recently completed randomized Phase 2 trial in patients with alopecia areata do not justify progression of the program into pivotal studies. These data are expected to be prepared for and submitted to a future medical meeting. Our Phase 2 trial of topical ruxolitinib continues in patients with atopic dermatitis, and we expect to initiate a Phase 2 trial of topical ruxolitinib in patients with vitiligo in the coming weeks.","I will now finish my section on our expected news flow. On slide 15, you can see the progress we expect to make in our portfolio in the next 12 months. In addition to those programs we've already touched on, we expect data presentations from both our BRD inhibitors and our PIM inhibitor by yearend and we hope to be in a position to provide initial data from our immuno-oncology doublet paired biopsy trials later in 2017.","Within our partnered programs, we expect data from the study of capmatinib in combination with EGFR inhibitors later this year, and we'll provide updates as appropriate regarding the clinical development of baricitinib.","With that, I'll pass the call to Dave for the financial.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone. In the first quarter, we recorded $384 million of total revenue. This was comprised of $294 million in net product-related revenue and $90 million in contract revenue. Product-related revenue of $294 million represents 43% growth over the same period last year. It is comprised of $251 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $14 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $29 million in Jakafi royalties from Novartis and $400,000 in Olumiant royalties from Lilly.","Our commercial operations in Europe continue to perform well and I'm pleased to confirm that Takeda has notified us they will not be exercising the buyback option related to Iclusig product rights in Europe.","The $90 million in contract revenue consists of a milestone paid to us by Novartis related to a Phase 3 study for ruxolitinib in GVHD, and a milestone paid to us by Lilly for the European approval of Olumiant.","The first quarter Jakafi royalties of $29 million represents 32% growth over the same period last year, but is slightly lower than the fourth quarter of 2016, because the royalty tiers reset each calendar year, and we are in the lower tier in the first part of each year. In addition, Olumiant royalties of $400,000 reflect the product approval and launch by Lilly late in the first quarter.","Based on the recent news of the baricitinib complete response letter in the U.S., we have decided to take a very conservative approach around milestone guidance for the remainder of 2017, and we are removing remaining baricitinib approval and development milestones from our 2017 financial guidance. Our revised milestone guidance is now up to $130 million for the full year 2017, of which we have already recognized $90 million in the first quarter.","We believe that this is a very fluid situation, and we look forward to updating you on any material changes to our milestone guidance at the appropriate times once we get more clarity. Our gross-to-net adjustments for the first quarter was approximately 15%. This was driven primarily by Jakafi and as with similar oral oncology products, our gross-to-net adjustment is higher in the first quarter of the year than the rest of the year, primarily because our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients. We expect our gross-to-net adjustment for the full year 2017 will be approximately 13%.","Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $15 million. This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis on U.S. Jakafi net sales and the amortization of the acquired product rights related to the Iclusig product acquisition in Europe.","Our R&D expense for the quarter was $408 million, including $22 million in non-cash stock compensation and $209 million in upfront and milestone expenses related to the amended Agenus collaboration and the new Merus and Calithera collaborations.","Given the recently announced expansion of our development collaboration agreement with Merck and also now with BMS for the initiation of Phase 3 studies of epacadostat, we are updating our current R&D guidance to a range of $1 billion to $1.1 billion. This includes the $209 million in upfront and milestone expenses related to our collaborations previously mentioned. Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $87 million including $9 million in non-cash stock compensation. We recorded $7 million in expense related to the change in the fair market value of a contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability in the first quarter.","Moving on to non-operating expenses, we recorded $6 million of unrealized loss on our long-term investments in Merus and Agenus, net interest expense of $5 million and one-time debt exchange expense of $54 million related to senior note conversions.","During the quarter, we significantly de-levered our balance sheet in a cost-effective manner by entering into agreements with some of the holders of our 2018 and 2020 notes to exchange a total of $703 million in aggregate principal amounts for a 13.5 million shares of our common stock. We recorded $54 million in expense related to the senior note conversions.","These transactions resulted in reduction of debt in the balance sheet and an increase of our outstanding share count. And at the end of the quarter, the value of our remaining senior notes has decreased to $42 million and our outstanding share count has increased to 204.6 million shares. Accordingly, interest expense will be lower in subsequent quarters of the year.","We recorded tax benefit of $11 million on the pre-tax loss in the first quarter. This tax benefit will reverse over remaining quarters of the year based on net income projections for the full year in certain states. We anticipate recording an insignificant consolidated tax expense for the full year in 2017.","For the first quarter, we recorded a net loss of $187 million. The net loss was primarily driven by the upfront and milestone expenses related to the Merus, Calithera and Agenus collaborations of $209 million and the one-time expense related to the senior note conversions of $54 million. Subtracting these items, net income would have been $60 million.","Looking at the balance sheet. We ended first quarter with $512 million in cash and marketable securities and expect to end the year with over $600 million in cash and marketable securities. Incorporating the changes the guidance previously discussed, we now expect to have a net loss for the full year of approximately $150 million to $170 million. Subtracting the previously detailed $209 million upfront in milestone expenses and $54 million note conversion expanses forecasted net income for the full year would be approximately $90 million to $120 million.","To summarize, Jakafi delivered strong revenue growth for the first quarter. We entered into new collaborations which expanded product pipeline and we continue to make significant advancements in our clinical development programs as evidenced by our announcement to enter into multiple additional Phase 3 studies with epacadostat. Incyte is well positioned from a revenue and cash perspective to fund our development programs, and we are confident we will deliver significant long-term shareholder value.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open up the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just wondering if you could help us frame for the epacadostat Phase 2 data that we're going to see at ASCO, how we should think about the efficacy and safety thresholds that played a role in you moving the program forward versus the IO drugs in the space.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Salveen. It's Steven answering your question. As we stated all through last year, there were three ways we framed the data sets in that we wanted to see response rates for the doublet, we wanted to see evidence of duration of response as well as an idea of progression-free survival because these would be the likely endpoints in a regulatory directive study. And lastly, we wanted to at least get some hypothesis from the biomarker data set.","So, in terms of the meat of your question, for all the data we will show, you will have, based on contemporary historical data, an idea of both response rate and progression-free survival. And for us, you will see why we made the go-forward Phase 3 decisions based on what we think are appreciable deltas in the response rate and then a likelihood of needing to get to the required progression-free survival rates based on our durability of response through demonstrated, through (23:38). Quantitatively, it's really histology by histology, but we wanted to see what we think are appreciable deltas in response rate that would indicate a benefit for the doublet, and then long-term durability of response. In each of the presentations, you will see that data portrayed for you.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then just following up on that. We are going to get first in human data from the BRD and PIM programs by year-end. Can you just remind us, is it going to be both at the BRD programs and the design of these studies as well?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Sure. It's Steven again answering your question. Yes. It will be for both of the BRD compounds. There are all standard dose escalation studies done to standard criteria largely along safety. And then for PIM, it's similar design as well. There is an intent within both of them once we establish a safe dosing schedule to move to combinations for which Reid's group has already presented at prior AACRs a very interesting combination data. So, we wanted to move the escalations along safety focus relatively briskly to get there, and the intent is to present both.","The last thing I will add is, obviously, at some point in time during this calendar year, we'll be pursuing, in terms of opening up further, one of the BRD compounds rather than the other based on an overall assessment of both, which will include pharmacokinetic criteria, pharmacodynamic criteria, and maybe some early efficacy data. So, as we go forward, it will end up being one of the BRD compounds.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Leerink. Please state your questions.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I had first a commercial question regarding Jakafi, which grew significantly in the first quarter here relative to the historic first quarters. And I was just wondering if you provide some more color on the inventory? How much of that was driven by inventory growth? And secondly, I guess, why didn't you raise 2017 guidance given the strong first quarter? It looks like you're on $1 billion plus annual run rate at this point already.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, Michael, this is Barry. Thanks for the question. First, on inventory. So, as you know, we had strong demand growth we said of 6%. We exited 2016, fourth quarter of 2016 at the low end of inventory at about two and a half weeks, and we moved up to about three weeks. So, you can see that inventory on hand. In terms of the guidance, (26:41) we had the strong demand growth and we had some inventory build back up to about three weeks. So, we just want to see some more data in the second quarter before we do anything with the Jakafi guidance.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. And then, I had a question on epacadostat. I saw on ClinicalTrials.gov that you're initiating a very large program evaluating the triple combination of epacadostat with PD-1 inhibitors and chemotherapy. And I was just wondering if you could provide some more color on the thought process behind this trial and the tumor types that you have chosen to study in this setting. Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Michael, it's Steven. So, if you step back, the strategic thought process is around \u2013 we are not married to the need for chemotherapy or not. We feel that is one other mode that can be used in the immuno-oncology setting to enhance response and the various theoretical reasons why chemotherapy may do that, including exposure of neoantigens, et cetera. Others have already generated data using their PD-1 or PDL-1 inhibitors with chemotherapy showing that. In addition, if you just look at the lung space, you can see that there is both a role for IO \u2013 IO doublets as well as IO chemotherapies. So, given all of the above, we felt we need to get a combination safety data in various histologies with chemotherapy and with dominant regimens used in those various settings. We also wanted to test the hypothesis, both in so-called hot tumors as well as potentially colder areas, to see if we can further enhance efficacy signals there. And lastly, I would just add, some of that may be enabling for future use in other studies including future Phase 3 studies.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks, Steven.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Butler with Guggenheim. Please state your question.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good morning and thank you very much. I have two, if I may. In the REACH trials be it acute or in chronic, what actually defines steroid-refractory? Is it an immune response that does not occur after a week of prednisone or exactly what? And then, could you please help define what is a complete response? And then the second question is on 872, the LSD inhibitor, new trial which I think you'll start enrolling next month in sickle-cell anemia. I'm curious of your hypothesis or at least views on silencing minigenes other than simply fetal hemoglobin. Might that actually have a fairly significant or deleterious effect on the patients? Thanks very much.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Tony. It's Steven again. I will do your first question and then I'll ask Reid Huber to address your second question about LSD1 in sickle cell. In terms of the REACH studies in general and the use of glucocorticoid as a standard initial therapy, the most common used is methylprednisolone is usually used at a dose of 2 milligrams per kilogram in divided doses. And the standard accepted definition is that the patients who demonstrate either progression of the graft versus host disease by day five, or non-response by day seven, are traditionally considered to have corticosteroid resistance and need to go on to other therapies.","In terms of the criteria \u2013 your second part of your question \u2013 to evaluate what a response is or what indeed a complete response is. There are a well-established criteria that we use in for our day-28 response rate that assess disease in skin, the GI tract and liver. For a complete response, you would need manifestations that were there before to have disappeared in those organ systems and we'd be using traditional response criteria there.","I'll ask Reid to address your second part.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. So, in terms of the 872 program in sickle cell disease, the team here has conducted a number of preclinical studies to understand the impact of LSD1 inhibition on sickle cell disease parameters in rodent models, and those data, I think, have been presented now and are quite compelling, both in terms of the breadth of activity, but also in terms of the safety that one sees. Building on that safety experience, of course, I'll point out that we've completed rodent and non-rodent toxicology studies and also have emerging data from the Phase 1 oncology dose escalation program that all help to support the emerging safety profile of the compound. Of course, any effects in sickle cell disease directly related hemoglobin and other disease parameters will come from the first in-patients study in that patient group, and we'll have to see that data emerge before we can comment any further. But right now, we feel very comfortable with the pre-clinical efficacy and safety profile of the mechanism.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you, both, very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking my questions. I have two of them for you as well. So, first one's following up on Salveen's question. When thinking about the relative comparison you're making for your epacadostat PD-1 combos, is it really versus PD-1 monotherapy, or are you looking relative to established standards of care whether mono or combination therapies in the various tumor types? And then I have a follow-up too, after.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Cory. It's Steven. I think it's both. Let me explain myself. So, if you look in terms of obtaining regulatory approval and your designs against PD-1 alone, obviously, that benchmark would be established by prior studies or indeed a label if it was approved. However, you know better than most, the field is moving very quickly, and during the time on the conduct of the study, further data sets could come out with different benchmarks which would then be clinical benchmarks until those regimens were approved. I think this is maybe best illustrated by the melanoma area where obviously our design in ECHO-301 is pembro plus epacadostat versus pembro. The pembro monotherapy PFS rate is around 5.5 to 6 months. However, the ipi-nivo regimen in that same setting gives you a progression-free survival rate of around 11.5 months. So, to win, from a regulatory point of view in that study, we would have to beat the pembro mono arm, but the efficacy territory that the community maybe expect would potentially be more in the doublet area in that particular setting. That's on the efficacy side.","From a safety point of view, and tolerability being really important, I think once you're in that efficacy territory, then you would start looking at the tolerability of your doublet. And with now \u2013 published now with more than one year of exposure data for pembro plus epacadostat update at ESMO last year, we're very confident in the tolerability profile of our doublet. So, long answer to your question, but it's both \u2013 but you segment them in what you need to get regulatory approval and then what you'd need for a clinical-commercial standard.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's very helpful. Then my second question is regarding baricitinib's ongoing development. And how much do plans for other indications like atopic dermatitis or psoriatic arthritis hinge on what you learn from the FDA in the upcoming post-CRL meeting? I mean, at this point, do you expect one to have a meaningful impact on the other? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Cory. Again, it's Steven. I'll go first. If we just step back, I think given the review process and regulatory outcome in Europe last year and the approval this year, we were both surprised and disappointed that this was the outcome of the FDA review. We remain confident in the benefit\/risk of baricitinib as a new treatment option for adults with rheumatoid arthritis. And obviously, we look forward to working with Lilly in the development of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis and beyond.","I appreciate your question around the potential impact on other indications. And you mentioned atopic dermatitis and psoriatic arthritis. And these programs, I'll just remind everyone on this call, are obviously run by Lilly and driven by them with our appropriate input. And they've guided to the fact that these continue to proceed forward. In terms of the CRL itself, just to address that, we won't be providing on this call any additional color beyond what Lilly's already stated on their quarterly call, which is that they will be meeting with the FDA to discuss the CRL within the next 60 days and to discuss the FDA's concerns and next steps. And that may impact the programs you mentioned. But at this junction in time, we can't comment further.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Steven. Appreciate the insight.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking...","[Technical Difficulty] (36:41-36:49)","Operator","Ms. Young, please press star one on your phone again.","[Technical Difficulty] (36:52-37:05)","Operator","Go ahead, Ms. Young, with your question.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Can you guys hear me?","Operator","Yes.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. So, the question is, on the PD-1, do you guys \u2013 what progress have you made and is there a need for a back-up asset there as further investment with your immuno-oncology program? And the second question is with the Jakafi, are you finding that people are staying on longer or is there a deeper penetration or is the prevalence bigger? So, what are the dynamics there? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Alethia. Hi. It's Steven. I'll start off on your PD-1 question in terms of 1210, our PD-1 from Hengrui. That program is active. Patients are on study still, but we're maintaining a recruitment hold and we continue to assess the overall safety and efficacy of that particular compound before making further decisions on whether or not to go forward with that compound. I'll ask Herv\u00e9 to address the need for a back-up at this stage, but as I just said, we're still in review of the Hengrui compound.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. So, depending on how we are moving with this compound, there is obviously two scenarios. If we move forward, it's very simple. If we don't, I think we will be in a position where we may be looking at alternatives, but we don't know that yet. So, it's really pending more review of the existing program.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","And Alethia, for your second question related to Jakafi, it really is about greater penetration into the prevalent patient population in PV and MF. I think we've said before and it's true today that the prevalence of MF that we estimate is about 15,000 patients. We have more than 30% \u2013 we penetrate more than 30% of that prevalent population, but we still have a ways to go. And in PV, while we continue to grow even faster than MF, and adding new patients, the population that we've said that are refractory to hydroxyurea is about 25,000 patients and we penetrated a little more than 10% of that patient population. So, it's really about getting new patients and we continue to grow and add new patients. And those patients do stay on for a long period of time. We have lots of patients who have been on for years on Jakafi for myelofibrosis especially.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Christopher Marai with Nomura. Please state your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi. This is Michelle (39:54) on for Chris. We were hoping you could discuss the tolerability of topical ruxo. Last week, there was data from an IST at the Society for Investigative Dermatology in vitiligo, and there were some adverse events that caught our eye, particularly the redness, rash and the transient acne. Can you talk about the overall tolerability of your topical formulation of ruxo and also whether the market research for vitiligo and atopic derm suggests that these rash and acne will be issues?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Michelle (40:36). It's Steven. In terms of a topical ruxolitinib program, in general, we've had one public presentation of data in mid-November last year, which was the initial open phase of our alopecia areata data set. And you're right, there are minor grade 1 and 2, what I would describe as irritant skin reactions early on. But nothing that we or our investigators have found at all worrying that should impact at this junction studying topical ruxolitinib in either vitiligo or atopic dermatitis.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. So, was the discontinuation of the alopecia areata program just an efficacy decision, or can you talk about what went into that a little bit more?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, sure. It's Steven again. It is driven primarily by the lack of a sufficient efficacy signal to proceed to pivotal programs. It was a study that was conducted over 24 weeks. It was in the close phase of the one I just referenced where it's randomized against placebo and there wasn't enough of a difference in the topical ruxolitinib formulation versus placebo formulation to warrant going ahead in a pivotal program in alopecia areata. We're busy investigating the reasons for that. It may be related to scalp penetration being different from other areas of the skin, for example. That's all hypothetical at this juncture, largely be driven by us looking at the pharmacokinetic and pharmadynamic data that we get from that study as we investigate further.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. And then your CITADEL-101 data at ASCO, will that include combination data with itacitinib?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","It's Steven again. No, it's early data of monotherapy across B-cell malignancies. It does not have combination data in yet.","Unknown Speaker","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please state your question.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning, and thanks for the question. For Steven or Reid, on FGF, does a mechanism speak to activity in other tumor types beyond the ones you've highlighted, not sure if a broader Phase 2 is also in the works in addition to Phase 3 plan? And I have a follow-up.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Geoff. This is Reid. So, we have two FGFR programs now in the clinic. So, one is the 1\/2\/3 inhibitor 54828 and the other program which will be entering Phase 1 here soon is the FGFR4 inhibitor. Just to cover that one, that FGFR4 program really is going to be focusing on hepatocellular carcinoma and specifically patients that have pathway activation of the FGF19, FGFR4 access. There could be some other opportunities to explore outside of that, but those are not going to be central to the early part of the development program.","A little bit different story for 54828 and FGFR1\/2\/3 inhibition, there are underlying tumor genetics of those three enzymes. In a number of solid tumor settings and liquid tumor settings, we remaining opportunistic in terms of where we take that compound and certainly the initial development program in bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and a very rare myeloproliferative neoplasm called 8p11 are all driven in large because of the emerging data that we generated within our Phase 1 dose escalation trial. We will continue to explore other areas where those genetics may be important, and there are a number of other solid tumors that are on our radar screen and I think more generally the field's radar screen. But for right now, the core focus is in bladder, cholangio and 8p11.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then, Herv\u00e9, bigger picture question. From looking at your pipeline chart, the obvious question is development capacity and what you'll select going forward. I mean, is it reasonable to use epacadostat as a template for how you can progress, maximize the number of Phase 3 programs or should we look to something like a formal out-licensing in the case baricitinib?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","No. I think \u2013 thanks for the question. I think I would say epacadostat is not typical because it's a mechanism that applies to potentially a very large number of genotype as you can see. So, I would not expect every program to go into eight or nine different Phase 3s as we are seeing with epacadostat. We just discussed FGFR as an example. There are some very precise indications where we want to test the molecule. Also, you will have a mix of narrowly applied product and some with broad application. So, that's really what we are expecting.","In term of licensing out, in case the portfolio is becoming so large that it's totally unmanageable, first we are very far from that. So, it's not the case today, and we can discuss the \u2013 so where the organization is growing at the same pace or ahead of the portfolio itself. But obviously, I mean, there are different options that we have. What we tend to do, and you can see that with what we just discussed about the topical formulation of ruxolitinib, is that we would like to move the programs further, establish their value, and then there is a question about commercialization. We can always open that very much later in the process, and that would be our preferred choice. And there could be exception to that, because when \u2013 you know there could be situations where as we have seen in \u2013 it was a different world at the time of baricitinib partnership, but there are also cases and indication where we could consider that having a partner is better than doing it ourselves.","So, we are fairly open, but we are not \u2013 in general, will be looking at building the value internally as far as we can go.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. One on ECHO-202 and 204. Can you tell us roughly how many patients worth of data should we expect at ASCO for those two combination trials with Keytruda and Opdivo? And then, secondly, maybe on the atopic dermatitis. Does your decision to start a Phase 2 trial of ruxolitinib have to do with the other Phase 2 run by Lilly in baricitinib?","And also maybe a high-level question for Herv\u00e9. The delay of FDA approval and also associated milestone and royalty from Lilly on baricitinib, would that curtail your appetite for external BD activity and also internal program progression? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Ying, hi. It's Steven. Just in terms of your first question, as I said in the script, it's approximately in the range of 30 to 40 patients per histology that we show. We were lucky enough at ASCO, and obviously our data warranted it, to get multiple presentations as we alluded to upfront. So, there's multiple orals as well as poster discussions. Quantitatively, you're dealing with patients in the hundreds total, but just point you towards each tumor type on its own, and we're roughly at 30 to 40 per tumor type in ECHO-202 and ECHO-204.","In terms of topical rux or atopic dermatitis, that is unrelated to any oral program with Eli Lilly, if I understand your question correctly. And then I'll hand it over to Herv\u00e9 for the second part of your question.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","So, yeah, your question is about BD appetite. I think the way we have been thinking about business development is really based on the portfolios \u2013 the dynamic of the portfolio. We spoke about PD-1 a little bit earlier. You can see in Q1 that it was \u2013 for some reason, it ended up \u2013 many of them ended up coming in Q1. It was very busy. You can see for each of them that we are looking at the long-term growth of the organization. So, we speak about the Merus partnership. We speak about the Calithera partnership where we have also, in terms of portfolio optionality, a lot of new options now coming from that partnership.","So, we will continue to look at that. I don't think the baricitinib advance or the delay we have there is changing the big picture, which is that we have a very rich internal portfolio and it's still the core of what Incyte is delivering is coming from our own research, with our own molecule that we are moving forward. But where if we see opportunities that makes sense long term for the shareholders and as a use of capital, we will continue to look at it knowing that there is no acute means for that. So, it's really a balance where we are able to look around and we are able to choose when we see something that we believe is creating value for the organization. So, no real chance in the direction there.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company, please state your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Morning, and thanks. Maybe another epacadostat question for Steven. Obviously, we've seen that some of the tumor subsets like head and neck were accepted for an oral presentation and others notably long were not. Should we assume that's representative of the strength of the data? And then in terms of also lung cancer and future developments, do your exclusivity provisions with Merck and Bristol provide enough space or room should Roche and AstraZeneca want to make go decisions in lung cancer? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Eric. Hi. It's Steven. Not at all in terms of the first question. It's unrelated to the efficacy signal in each. I think it's just related to the denominators in each of those settings in terms of what's submitted this, what's selected. And I can't speak to the program committee chairs who chose them. But from our point of view, there's no relation to the strength of the efficacy signal in the things being chosen for orals versus poster discussions.","In terms of exclusivity, just to be clear, with BMS, there is none. With Merck, there's a 15-month exclusivity around the ability to test the same clinical question. But a different clinical question that will be tested with Merck can be done in other studies going forward with either partner, should that occur.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with UBS. Please state your question.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, and congrats on all the progress. Thanks for the question. Probably one for Reid or Steve on 1158. I recognize your choices will be data dependent. But given the similarities and the metabolic-driven mechanism, wanted to know about how you're thinking about your base plans for 1158 in the context of epacadostat. I guess do you see this more as a follow on or a chance to improve upon epacadostat or more \u2013 or do you come at it with more of a bias to go after a differential instead of tumors? Thank you.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Carter. Thanks for the question. This is Reid. So, we're still early days with arginase as a mechanism right now. We have some clinical hypotheses that'll drive the early phases of the clinical development program and those include a belief that the mechanism is likely to be most active when it's used in combination regimens and specifically in IO doublet combination regimens. And so, there as you might expect, a combination with PD-1 access blockade is particularly attractive and could be a first step for the program. Given what we're learning about the potential for epacadostat to add efficacy without untoward safety with \u2013 when used with PD-1 access blockade, then you can imagine a triplet regimen being of interest, but of course, we've got a little bit more wood to chop before we get to that point.","Beyond that, there's an active preclinical research effort that we have now ongoing subsequent to the in-licensing of the compound from Calithera and we're looking at a number of other IO components and even chemo regimens and we'll understand the biology as we go forward in the clinic and we'll make decisions based on both the emerging clinical data as well as the emerging preclinical research.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please state your question.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. Great timing. Just a follow-up on that prior question. Does it make any sense to combine the arginase inhibitor with epacadostat at some point or is that overlapping? How do you see those two kind of possibly working together?","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Liisa, it's Reid. I think to the extent that they both address different distinct mechanisms within the tumor microenvironment, it's an interesting thing to explore. There are some recently published data that speak to the potential role for arginase and IDO1 activity in dendritic cells and you can imagine those are the sorts of things that we will explore pretty carefully pre-clinically and any decision to move that into clinical development would based on some pretty solid scientific rationale from the animal model work.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Please state your question.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. I have a couple of them related to epacadostat. And I apologize if they've been asked. I joined the call a little bit late. The first question is related to the ASCO presentation. Should we, as observers, be \u2013 do you think we'll be able to tease out differences in terms of the benefit you're observing with the PD-1 versus the PD-L1? Just if you could comment on that.","Second, just thinking about the Phase 3 program with Bristol and Merck, and maybe one of the key themes coming out of the AACR was need for further segmentation of the treatment of solid tumor patients. How will that sort of manifest itself in terms of the Phase 3 trial designs that you and your two partners have chosen to move forward with?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Ian, hi, it's Steven. The data that we're showing at ASCO in Chicago in a month is with PD-1 inhibitors with pembro, with the ECHO-202 with Merck, and with nivo with the ECHO-204 with BMS. So, you won't see at the upcoming meeting PD-L1 data with us at this juncture. In terms of segmentation in different areas and how things play out in terms of demographics and disease populations, as well as biomarkers, it's too early to comment because the designs aren't public yet. But I think it's safe to say in lung cancer, there's definitely a role for PD-L1 staining enrichment in different populations. And I won't make other segmentation comments beyond, the others will be more around lines of therapy; first, second line, et cetera.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Katherine Xu with William Blair. Please state your question.","Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Good morning. I'm just curious whether you could provide some updated thoughts on the IDO inhibitor competitive landscape, given the indoximod data at AACR and Roche TECENTRIQ plus their IDO1 inhibitor coming at ASCO and other earlier stage compounds?","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Katherine. This is Reid. So, we learned a little bit more about the competitive landscape at this past AACR Meeting in April. We had two disclosures, one from Bristol-Myers Squibb with the inhibitor that they in-license from Flexus as well as a disclosure on indoximod in combination with PD-1 blockade in melanoma.","I think just in general, both disclosures I think helped to underscore the interest the field has in IDO1 in addition either directly at the enzyme level or at the pathway level in the immuno-oncology space. As expected, the BMS compound is a potent and selective inhibitor. We knew that from earlier preclinical disclosures and is being dosed to high inhibitory multiple, similar to what we have done over the past years with epacadostat. I think it's far too early to develop any kind of an opinion on efficacy or safety and they're going to need more follow-up before we can make those sorts of statements.","In terms of Roche data, we haven't seen too much from them. Obviously, we look forward to the data that they disclosed at ASCO. I will say that epacadostat's profile to-date has been \u2013 we've been very pleased with that profile and we have now over 1,000 patients dosed with that drug without any clear liability that, I think, offers a competitor a path to differentiate on that mechanism. And our focus has been and continues to be expanding the competitive gap we have versus those competitors. And I think the up to nine plus pivotal trials we have to initiative with Bristol and Merck, and the ongoing work in the earlier phases of the ECHO program help to underscore just how broad the epacadostat effort is right now and will be over the near future. And hopefully, that will continue to drive the most important differentiation in the space, which is bringing the therapy to the appropriate patients in a pivotal or even a commercial setting.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached our one-hour mark for today's earnings call. Our final question will come from Ren Benjamin with Raymond James. Please state your question.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Great. Thanks, guys, for squeezing me in and congratulations on a great quarter. Maybe just two questions. One, the delta program. Can you help us think about how you're thinking about the landscape? Do you establish value as a monotherapy or should we really be thinking about how this is going to look in combination with not just itacitinib, but also other combinations? And then second question is on the ET pivotal program. Can you talk a little bit about maybe that design, how long you think it'll last and what the ET could potentially add to the $2 billion peak sales that you already have established for the MF and PF franchises and GVHD. Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","So, Reni, I'll do your first two questions, but the second part of your second one, I'll let somebody else address in terms of its potential commercial value. But the PI3 kinase delta program, in a nutshell, the way we view it is it's a second generation inhibitor and all the data we have to-date by removing one of the chemical moiety that are in the first-generation compounds, like idelalisib and duvelisib, we've been able to, for the most part, get rid of any liver signals. So, we're not seeing transaminitis to-date in the program and we think it's because of that adjustment to the chemistry.","But beyond that, these are, as a class very, very active compounds as monotherapy. The real issue becomes long-term tolerability particularly as you get out beyond the 140, 150 days, and that's where our challenge is now. We know we have an active compound. We presented data at ASH last year across B cell malignancies a very high efficacy. What we need now is working internally and then with our investigators and ultimately with the Agency to come up with dose and the schedule modifications that help retain the efficacy, but then give you long-term tolerability. And that's in the monotherapy setting. I think in combination, we've been cautious and going slowly. We have numerous combinations ongoing in terms of safety enabling, but we have to be very focused on toxicity and appropriate prophylaxis. So, it's a little early to comment on combination with standard therapies in B cell malignancy.","With the delta program in general, there are numerous internal combinations of interest that we're investigating internally with various doublets that I doesn't have the time to go into now. Essential thrombocythemia, as Barry said in the upfront remarks, we're looking at a post hydrea (01:02:41) population where there is an unmet need, there's an approved drug in anagrelide? We have a Phase 2 that's published in 39 patients with rux in that setting that already show in a Phase 2 setting we can lower platelet count, we can lower white cell count and in a few patients who had a large spleen three or four of them had a reduction in that splenomegaly.","So, the design of our pivotal study here is using a composite endpoint around the hematologic parameters for which we've data that implicates that we have a good chance of success because we have proof of concept there. In terms of the commercial opportunity, I'll let either Barry or Herv\u00e9 address it.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","So, this is Barry. So, Steven really addressed it, there's a real need in the second-line population in ET for patients who regress or fail on hydroxyurea. About 8,000 patients, we estimate, are available. We'll see about the duration of therapy, but we know that ruxolitinib is likely to be an effective drug in that setting. We'll wait for the endpoints when we finish the study to see how long patients stay on therapy. Thanks.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","I'll now turn the conference back to management for closing remarks. Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Okay. Thank you for your time today and for your question. We look forward to seeing some of you at ASCO, I guess, or some other medical conferences.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Michael Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Incyte. Please go ahead.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Diego. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's third quarter 2015 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today will be made available for download on the Investor section of incyte.com following the call.","Speaking on today's call will be Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, our CEO, who will begin with a few words highlighting our progress during the quarter, and then Barry Flannelly, who leads our U.S. organization, will provide a commercial update on Jakafi. Rich Levy, who is in charge of Incyte's drug development activities, will update you on our clinical programs, and then Dave Gryska, our CFO, will outline our third quarter financial results. We'll then open up the call for Q&A, for which we'll be joined by Reid Huber, our Chief Scientific Officer, and by Steven Stein, Chief Medical Officer.","We'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2015 guidance, the commercialization of Jakafi, our development plans for Jakafi and other indications and for other compounds in our pipeline. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and from time to time in our other SEC documents.","I'd like to now pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for some introductory remarks. Herv\u00e9?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone. I believe that the third quarter of 2015 could be viewed as a period of transformational progress for Incyte. This belief is driven by two very important announcements we recently made on epacadostat and baracitinib, as these two assets have the potential to push Incyte forward on a global basis over the next several years.","Science drives our success here at Incyte, and we aim to create values through the investment we make in innovation. This investment in innovation has already completed into a unique portfolio of exciting opportunities both in immuno-oncology and across our targeted therapies.","There are currently 12 molecules in clinical development in our portfolio, and apart from the recently in-licensed PD-1 antagonist, all have been discovered in Incyte's laboratories. There are three main benefits that arise from this. Firstly, risk mitigation; having numerous molecules in development reduces our dependence on the success of any one of them.","Secondly, our portfolio gives us significant combinatorial optionality. We can seek to develop our agents alone, as additions to standard of care and we can also seek to develop them in novel-novel combination.","And thirdly, as we look further forward to the potential commercialization of our compound, we believe that the financial benefit to Incyte shareholders may be greater than industry norms because there's a relative lack of third-party payments.","As we review our progress, since we spoke at the end of Q2 we have seen two landmark events in the ongoing transformation of Incyte. The first was the announcement with Merck of our plans to advance the combination of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab into Phase III development for the first line treatment of advanced metastatic melanoma. This trial is expected to begin in the first half of 2016. The expanded collaboration with Merck shares our financial burden and also demonstrate our shared confidence in the clinical program. This is a key landmark in the history of Incyte because this would be Incyte's first Phase III program for a compound for which we intend to keep global commercialization rights.","The second landmark was a positive outcome of the baricitinib Phase III program with Lilly. The key announcement here was the bean (4:44) study with data showing oral baricitinib to be superior to Humira, the injectable form of care in controlling the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. The third quarter was also very successful for us commercially, with Jakafi continuing to show strong growth, both from our continuing effort in MF as well as the ongoing launch in PV.","Jakafi has fueled our business for the past four years and we expect this will continue for years to come, but Incyte is now entering a new phase in its evolution. We anticipate having a second variable source of income coming from baricitinib and we can see a path to registration for epacadostat. We also have a clinical portfolio that is rich in optionality and potential synergies. Combined, I think we can say that Incyte is now on a new track as we continue our transformation into a world-class biopharmaceutical organization.","With that overview, I'll pass the call to Barry for some additional details on Jakafi's performance in the quarter.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone.","Net product revenues for Jakafi during the third quarter were $161 million, an increase of 65% year-over-year. As a result of the continued growth, we are raising our net product revenue guidance for Jakafi for 2015. We are raising it from a range of $560 million to $575 million to a new range of $580 million to $590 million.","When we spoke to you at the end of Q2, we provided a detailed look at the launch of Jakafi for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera. I'm very pleased to be able to tell you that the launch in uncontrolled PV remains strong and we are also seeing continued growth in demand from patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis.","The graph on the left of slide eight shows the total number of Jakafi prescribers. Quarter-by-quarter over the last year, the graphic shows the consistent increase in our prescriber base. We believe that this reflects the ongoing and successful efforts of our U.S. organization to educate physicians about the unmet need in patients with polycythemia vera as well as Jakafi's therapeutic profile in MPNs.","The graph on the right shows the percentage increase Q3 over Q2 in the total number of MF and PV patients taking Jakafi. While we see strong growth in the number of PV patients on Jakafi, it is also good to see continued growth in the use of Jakafi in patients with MF.","With that, I'll pass the call to Rich for the clinical highlights.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Barry. In the next few slides I'll highlight the key clinical updates, first on epacadostat and then on baricitinib, before providing a summary of the portfolio. First, on epacadostat, our selective IDO1 inhibitor. We're currently conducting four proof-of-concept studies of epacadostat plus PD-1 axis antagonist, and all these trials are continuing to enroll patients.","In October, we announced the acceptance by the Society of Immunotherapy of Cancer, or SITC, of a late-breaking abstract detailing safety and efficacy data from our Phase I\/II study evaluating epacadostat in combination with Merck's pembrolizumab. This will be the first presentation of data from epacadostat in combination with a PD-1 or PD-L1 directed antibody.","As we announced this morning, the embargo on the abstract of the upcoming presentation by Dr. Gangadhar at SITC has now been lifted and we can share those data with you. At the time of the data cutoff made to generate the abstract, safety information was available for 28 patients and efficacy data was available for 19 patients. In Dr. Gangadhar's presentation on Friday, there will be 56 patients in the safety analysis and efficacy data from 47 patients.","The data in the abstract is summarized on slide 10 and reveal an emerging clinical profile that we're very pleased with. The combination of epacadostat and pembrolizumab was generally well tolerated and the efficacy data suggests promising clinical activity. We believe that the safety is an important aspect of the product profile, especially compared to the recently approved immuno-oncology doublet in melanoma.","On the efficacy slide, and focusing on the melanoma cohort, the data table shows an overall response in four patients of seven patients and disease control in six patients of the seven patients. We believe these data also compare favorably to historical benchmarks. In the presentation on Friday, there will be efficacy data from 19 evaluable melanoma patients and it is these data that have driven our decision to progress into a Phase III trial.","Moving now to slide 11, I'd like to remind you that we recently announced with Merck that we're expanding our clinical collaboration to include a pivotal Phase III study of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab. The trial is expected to begin in the first half of next year and will be conducted in the first line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma. We'll co-fund the study with Merck. We believe that conducting this study with Merck has numerous advantages. We're able to work alongside a great clinical partner. Merck has global reach and access to a significant network of melanoma centers. This in turn has the potential to enable rapid recruitment into the study.","We also hope that a pivotal trial in melanoma is just the beginning for our plans with epacadostat. We'll continue to build the clinical databases in different tumor histologies with Merck and with our other clinical collaborators. And if the data warrant it, we'll seek to move as quickly as possible into additional pivotal studies in other indications.","Moving now to baricitinib, we've recently announced with Lilly the results of the two Phase III rheumatoid arthritis studies evaluating baricitinib head to head against two of the most widely-used RA treatments. In RA-BEGIN, baricitinib monotherapy showed efficacy superior to methotrexate monotherapy in treatment-na\u00efve patients. And in the second study, RA-BEAM, on a background of methotrexate baricitinib showed superior efficacy to Humira, the market-leading biologic for patients with inadequate responses to conventional DMARDs.","In both studies, baricitinib was generally well tolerated and we look forward to the presentation of the detailed efficacy and safety results at the upcoming American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Francisco. The RA-BEGIN presentation is scheduled for November 8, and the RA-BEAM presentation is scheduled for November 10.","Incyte and Lilly will host an investigator conference call and webcast on November 11 to review the results with you and we hope you can participate in that event. We and Lilly agree that these are outstanding results and the Lilly team is now squarely focused on global regulatory submissions.","I'll now discuss a few highlights across our clinical portfolio. JANUS-I, our pivotal Phase III trial of ruxolitinib in pancreatic cancer, continues to enroll patients on schedule. And we continue to expect data in 2016. We've reached full-target enrollments in the ruxolitinib Phase II trials in breast cancer and in colon cancer, and the data from these studies are also expected during 2016. These are all event-driven studies, and so we're not able to pinpoint the timelines to data with more precision at this stage.","As indicated on slide 13, we had two candidates in clinical trials since we've spoken to you at the end of quarter two. Our pan-PIM kinase inhibitor, 53914, and our newly-acquired PD-1 inhibitor 1210 have both entered proof-of-concept studies in hematologic malignancies and solid tumors respectively. We've also initiated a Phase II trial of the topical formulation of ruxolitinib in patients with alopecia areata. We've previously studied topical ruxolitinib in patients with psoriasis and this new study builds on published data showing efficacy of oral JAK inhibitors, including ruxolitinib, in alopecia areata.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave for an update on our financials.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rich. For the third quarter of 2015, we recorded net product revenues from Jakafi of $161 million and royalties from Novartis on ex-U.S. Jakavi sales of $80 million. Total revenue in the third quarter amounted to $187 million. R&D expense in the third quarter was $132 million, which included the $25 million upfront payment made to Hengrui related to license agreement for the anti-PD-1 antibody 1210. SG&A for Q3 was $48 million. In addition, we recorded an unrealized loss of $31 million related to our investment in Agenus, reflecting the change in the Agenus stock price during the quarter. The unrealized loss on the investment in Agenus year-to-date is approximately $4 million. We ended the quarter with $635 million in cash and cash equivalents.","Moving now to financial guidance for the full-year 2015, driven by the strong underlying demand for Jakafi we are updating our full-year 2015 net product revenue guidance. We are now expecting that product revenues for the full year to be between $580 million to $590 million, up from $560 million to $575 million.","During the third quarter of 2015 we recognized a $5 million milestone payment from Novartis in relation to initiation of the Phase II trial for capmatinib in glioblastoma. We have also recently received notice from Novartis that we have received approval for Jakafi in Japan for PV, which will trigger a $15 million milestone payment from Novartis that we expect to recognize in Q4 of 2015. Accordingly, we now expect our full-year contract revenue to be $78 million, up from our previous guidance of $58 million.","As previously announced, our contract revenue guidance for 2015 also includes the anticipation of an additional $20 million milestone payment from Novartis. This milestone is related to the commercial performance of Jakafi given the year-end sales and sales trends of Jakafi. We expect this milestone to be recognized in the fourth quarter of 2015. We are leaving our R&D guidance for full-year 2015 unchanged, despite the payment of $25 million to Hengrui in the third quarter. This reflects the changes in timing of other anticipated R&D expenses from Q4 of 2015 into Q4 of 2016. We have tightened the range for full-year 2015 SG&A guidance to an updated range of $200 million to $210 million.","Operator, that concludes our formal remarks. Please open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll now conduct our question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Carter Gould with Barclays. Please state your question.","Carter Gould - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Carter on for Jeff (16:33). Thanks for taking the question. First off, congrats on the transformative progress in the third quarter. First question, will we see the response rates broken out by dose at SITC? And secondly, is there anything you could say about how your approach towards your strategic optionality has changed after the Merck deal? Thank you.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. So this is Rich. There will be data broken out by dose on both safety and efficacy at SITC. But with that said, I'm not going to get into any of the details until those data are presented there. And this does not really change our strategy with respect to trying to continue to work with multiple partners going forward. So we have this one arrangement to do a Phase III study in melanoma with Merck. There are many other potential indications and we look forward to doing those studies when the data are fully supportive to make that decision to go forward, either with Merck or with any of our other collaborators.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Matt Roden with UBS. Please state your question.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Congrats on the progress both on the commercial side and on the pipeline side. And thanks for taking the question. First on IDO, I guess typically when you look at early-stage oncology results, as the sample size increases, as you go into larger trails, you tend to see a little bit of an erosion of response rates and efficacy just as you go into larger patient populations. I guess the question would be, as we think about the SITC presentation on Friday is this the sort of phenomenon that we should be thinking about in terms of going from 19 patients evaluated up to 47? And then assuming that there is still real differentiation with these data versus the currently available PD-1 axis inhibitors and combinations thereof, at what point do you feel like it warrants consideration for FDA breakthrough designation? Is that something we should be thinking about? And then if I'm allowed I'll come back with a commercial follow-up.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Thanks, Matt. This is Rich again. So with respect to the SITC data, it's obviously more robust. I would say that as a very broad statement, there are not major changes in the data from what you're seeing, but you're just going to have to wait for the data per se. And really not going to comment on our regulatory strategies with respect to breakthrough or not.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks for taking that. And then I guess on the commercial side, you mentioned consistent growth in your prescriber base. Now it looks like you're up to about 3,500 if I'm reading the graph rate. How high can this go? What do you think the target prescriber base could be? And then I guess related, Barry, if you can talk about to what extent you're seeing early-year utilization in myelofibrosis into the INT-1 patients on label that I think historically has been a lower penetrated segment. If you can just talk about where you are with that. Thanks very much.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Sure. So the target for prescriber base that we presented in the slides is really physicians who have prescribed in the last 12 months. There is more physicians who have prescribed. And obviously you know there is somewhere between 10,000 and 11,000 hematologists-oncologists in the United States, some of whom don't practice. You can only go so high in the total number of prescribers that you have and lots of those oncologists-hematologists may not even see any NPM patients at all.","And then in terms of earlier, we certainly have patients now who are being treated who are intermediate-1 myelofibrosis patients. And I think that was it.","Matthew Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Marc Frahm with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on all the progress. First of all, with the Phase III trial with the epacadostat, are you going to be selecting patients based on any sort of biomarker of PD-1 or maybe something else? And then along those lines, will we see any of that type of data at SITC?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","I'm really not going to get into the details of the trial until we have finalized it and I'll likely put it up on clinicaltrials.gov. And I'm really not at this point going to go into the details of what will be presented at SITC, beyond what's in the current abstract.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then thinking forward to as hopefully you go to more tumor types than just melanoma, where do you guys see the hurdle being to justify going to a Phase III in say lung cancer? And then if you get to that point, do you see the melanoma collaboration with Merck as kind of a model or would you maybe not go with an exclusive relationship?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So I'll take the first question. And what we look for is it has to be \u2013 generally these studies are going to be done as an add-on to the PD-1, where a PD-1 or PD-L1 has already established to be effective. So in order for those trials to come out positive, you have to have the expectation that the combination will be more effective than the mono therapy with the PD-1 agent alone. And then secondly, in terms of our profile in the cases where there is comparator data in the public domain with other doublets such as nivolumab and ipilimumab, we would be looking to at least mirror the efficacy in those trials with a safety advantage or potentially have clear efficacy advantages over those other doublets. And with respect to the designs of deals around other trials, I mean I'd ask somebody else to take that question.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Maybe I can take it. I think you have to think about it as an IDO program, epacadostat program. Our best interest is to develop the product in multiple indication in multiple lines of therapy. So the way the relationship with Merck is working is really specific to the line of therapy in melanoma where the Phase III study is doing. So we would be obviously looking for other patient groups where we could do Phase III studies. So what I'm saying is that, don't think of this two year of exclusivity as limiting us for other indications, other combinations, other lines of therapy; it's not. So from a certain standpoint, we could imagine in the future doing different types of relationship with a partner or to have it under the same type that we have seen here. In both cases it would not prevent us from developing IDO broadly in multiple indications in the future if we choose to, and that's really what's important to us.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. So I mean we really shouldn't look at this as kind of the model that will be applied, maybe with different companies but the same type of structure, but it shouldn't really inform us for other tumor types or other lines of therapy?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I don't see \u2013 I think it could be. What I'm saying is that it could be under the same type of relationship or not. In fact, none of that has been decided yet. But in both cases it would not limit us from developing epacadostat in multiple indications in the future if the clinical data justifies doing it and that's really what's important.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then one last if I can on the commercial side. On Jakafi guidance I think it kind of implies kind of a slowing in growth, a pretty significant slowing in growth in Q4 compared to what Q3 had. We've seen that there's been maybe about a 4% price increase late in Q3. So why would we expect the growth to slow so much even if you also have the tailwind of a price increase?","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","We think the guidance is prudent. At the high end of guidance it's about a 7% quarter-over-quarter growth. Fourth quarter can be a little bit unpredictable just because of the number of holidays you have in November and December. So again, we just think it's prudent going forward to have that range. That's now tight, of course, because we're getting to the end of the year. Okay?","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Brittany R. Terner - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, guys, this is actually Brittany in for Cory. Thanks for taking the questions. So you previously talked about the PV launch to be more gradual than MF given I guess less urgency to treat. Is that still your view? And then secondly, on baricitinib, is there anything that you could say on the potential next steps for the diabetic neuropathy indication? Thanks.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","So I'll take the first part of your question, if I heard it correctly. So you're just saying that the urgency to treat in PV versus MF, is that what you were trying to get at?","Brittany R. Terner - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. Just if you expect to launch to be more gradual in PV still.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Well, I think we said it all long is that PV patients are sometimes perfectly controlled with phlebotomy or aspirin or sometimes with hydroxyurea, but there is lots of patients who are intolerant to hydroxyurea or get inadequate response to hydroxyurea and those patients are coming on Jakafi now. And we have great expectations for this launch to continue into next year and beyond.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So this is Rich on your second question. So just to clarify, it's diabetic nephropathy, not diabetic neuropathy. It's about the kidney. Second, the decision as to exactly how and if that product will go into registration studies is up to Lilly and they have not announced their intentions as of yet. And we also have the option to buy into participation in that study as we bought into rheumatoid arthritis. And that period of time in which we make that decision has not come yet until we see the final development plan and cost in addition to the data that we've already seen from the Phase II study. But those decisions should be made in the next relatively modest period of time.","Brittany R. Terner - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Maury Raycroft with Jefferies. Please state your question.","Maury Raycroft - Jefferies, LLC","Hi. I am on for Brian Abrahams. Congrats on the progress and thank you for taking my question. So just kind of as a follow-up to Matt's question. So it sounds like the response rates may carry through to the larger data set on Friday. And I was wondering if you have any views into the durability of response and how the IDO plus pembro mechanism may compare to NIVO plus Ipi on a durability standpoint?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So again, I'm not going to go into the details of how the data that will come out on Friday compared to the data here, other than to say that there are not major differences. And I don't want anybody to over-interpret that and say that there are differences that are just short of major. It's just I'm not really commenting. With respect to durability, the data are still early with respect to how far out patients have been followed. There will some durability presented, but it's not as long a follow-up as you would see for example from registration trials that already exist. So you'll get to see the data, but it is less mature in terms of how long these responses or stable disease last.","Maury Raycroft - Jefferies, LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Marai with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.","Christopher N. Marai - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First, I was wondering if maybe you could comment on any mechanist rationale for epacadostat to potentially have a more profound benefit when treating patients in earlier lines of therapy. And then secondly, maybe on the commercial side, could you comment a little bit about how you may see the eventual cost of therapy going forward for patients? Do you see this as really something of an Ipi replacement and pricing coming into that range? And then maybe more broadly, could you comment on how the pricing potentially of epacadostat fits into your model of certainly combination therapies, whether it's with your own PD-1 eventually down the road or other combination therapies that you're thinking about at Incyte? Thanks.","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Yeah, Chris, this is Reid. With respect to your first question about whether there is a mechanistic rationale for IDO1 inhibition to be more effective in earlier lines of therapy, I think that's something we don't yet know. We learned a little bit about that question from the ipilimumab experience, where we presented some data to indicate that responses were more robust, deeper responses in patients who were na\u00efve to immunotherapy. That perhaps isn't that surprising, but it's the first time we've made that observation. I think going forward, it's going to have to be something that we continue to monitor in the trials. And I think overall in the field we don't really understand too well what resistance mechanisms are in play as patients unfortunately progress through successive lines of immunotherapy. And we may learn from those types of studies that there are some mechanisms that are more applicable to patients in earlier lines of treatment and other mechanisms which are more important with respect to the resistant population.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","And for your second question, it's a long way away from pricing strategies for epacadostat, but we really believe that we'll continue to create drugs and combinations of drugs that provide real value to patients. So the clinical benefit to patients ultimately will determine the value.","Christopher N. Marai - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And just maybe I want to follow up on that resistance mechanism to epacadostat or the epacadostat combos. Is there any reason to believe that you guys would have early hint of that data in the data set presented at SITC or is it just too soon to tell? Thanks.","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","You'll have to wait to see those data presented before we comment on that, but that's going to be a question that's evolving in the program over time. I think we'll have much more clarity as the program matures than we will at this early stage.","Christopher N. Marai - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks. Congrats on the quarter.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Leerink Partners. Please state your question.","Michael W. Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, good morning. And thanks for taking my question. I just had a follow-up to the prior speaker. So the pembrolizumab combination study, is that limited to immunotherapy-na\u00efve patients or are you looking at IO experience patients as well?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","The patients have to be na\u00efve to pembrolizumab, but they can have had some degree of prior treatment with immunotherapies.","Michael W. Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, understood. And then on your proprietary PD-1 inhibitor, can you just speak to your plans there and how do you see that fit into your portfolio?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Sure. So right now that molecule has entered into Phase I. Patients are now being dosed with it. We will first need to establish the safe dose with that drug and then potentially look at development both as monotherapy and in combination with our internal portfolio of agents that are potentially \u2013 are proven to be active in immunotherapy of cancer. But it is clearly behind and would not cause us to slow down any of our paths to registration with existing PD-1 or PD-L1 therapies.","Michael W. Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. And then one more on the SITC data set. Are you in a position to comment on biomarkers in that initial data set, or is that will you not have taken biopsies until later dose expansion cohorts are enrolled?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","I'm just going to really ask that people wait to see the data at the upcoming meeting.","Michael W. Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","All right. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America. Please state your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, everyone. It's Catherine (35:16) for Ying. I just have a couple of quick ones. I know you don't want to comment about the data at this stage. But can tell us out of the 47 patients how many will be lung? And then have you seen any liver enzyme elevations with the patients as you do with (35:33)? And then lastly, just quick one, can you break out unit growth versus price and inventory this quarter for Jakafi? Thank you.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","I'm sorry, I didn't really get your first question. Of the 47 patients how many are what?","Unknown Speaker","Are lung patients?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Oh, lung. You'll have to wait, but it is not an enormous number of patients at this point in time. More data will be coming, and we continue to enroll patients in each of these indications. With respect to LFTs, all I'd say is that we're quite happy with the emerging safety profile and we'd ask you to wait for the detailed data coming. And the last question was not a development question.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Yeah. Hi, Catherine (36:26), this is Barry. So the unit growth accounted for almost all of the growth quarter-over-quarter. So we took a price increase in the middle of September. So that really only added about $1 million to the sales; almost all of it was unit growth.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please state your question.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. Congrats on the data and most of my questions have actually been answered. But just a question about PV. Are you seeing the same sort of discontinuation in compliance rate as you have between PV and MF?","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","For participancy, we don't have that much data in PV. Obviously we just launched really in January. So you can look to our clinical trials. So if you look to response for example, follow-up on response you had 83% of patients were still on drug at about two years. In MF, if you looked at the COMFORT trials, you had 50% of patients were still on drug at three years. So we believe that persistency will probably end up being greater with PV, but we still need to accumulate more data. Thanks.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please state your question.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks very much. If we look at what was presented in the abstract from a grade 3-4 immune-related event there was one patient. And I'm simply trying to extrapolate, and I know it's small numbers, but if we look at nivo, that with the immune-related events were substantially higher, somewhere in the order \u2013 depending on the trial of course, at least in melanoma \u2013 of as much as 50%. So I wanted to comment on the safety of epacadostat, which seems to be at least with respect to immune-related events a bit better. And again, it's small numbers I recognize, but I'd love some commentary on it. And then the next question is again around corporate development to some degree as it relates to your IDO franchise in conjunction with your PD-1. Are there tumor types that you wish to retain that you would not be interested in actually partnering for future studies? Thank you.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","This is Rich, on the first question. So the data that's in the abstract that was released this morning does show that in these patients the rate of all grade 3 or higher events, and they were all only grade 3, was lower than the relatively related grade 3s with the ipilimumab-nivolumab combination and there will be more robust data on that later in the week. And as we said, our goals here are both to be able to have more effective therapy than the background treatments \u2013 in this case, pembrolizumab \u2013 and in terms of comparison to establish combinations to either have better efficacy or equivalent efficacy and better safety. And as we said, we're pleased with the data so far and we look forward to sharing more data with you on Friday.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you for that.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the second part of your question, on the PD-1 optionality and how it's sort of adding potential for our thoughtful user. Where we think about it is really in different timelines. The short-term, which is like the next three years, if we see indications where combination with existing approved PD-1 or PD-L1 is possible, we would not delay or retain that in any way. We would go ahead as quickly as we can with epacadostat in combination with this as our product.","Our own PD-1 program is opening a number of different options in term of combination, but not only with epacadostat. It's also true for many of the other products we have in our portfolio and this will come at a later stage. I don't think it would be reasonable to delay or reserve any indication at this point. If we see a path to registration, if we have a willing partner who would be ready to go with us, I think we will always give priority to the speed at which we can get our epacadostat approved in that indication.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you, Herv\u00e9.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, there are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot for closing remarks. Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Thank you. Thank you for your time today. Thank you for your questions. I know a lot of the questions were really to data that is not yet available. So we look forward to seeing you at the SITC or the ACR conferences where a lot of this data will be presented in the next few days. And I also want to remind you that Lilly and us will have an investor call from ACR in the morning of November 11, where really specifically we'll be speaking about the data that has been presented that day for baricitinib.

Please go ahead.","Pamela M. Murphy","Good morning and welcome to Incyte\u2019s first quarter 2014 conference call. On the call today are Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Daly, Chief Commercial Officer, Dave Hastings, Chief Financial Officer; Rich Levy, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Drug Development; and Reid Huber who heads Discovery Biology.","Herv\u00e9 will begin with a brief overview of the quarter, Jim will follow with an update on Jakafi, and Rich will highlight progress made in our clinical programs. Dave will then describe our first quarter financial results, after that we will open up the call for Q&A.","Before beginning, we would like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations for the commercialization of Jakafi and our development plans for Jakafi and other indications and for other compounds in our pipeline and our expectations for net product revenues. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and from time to time in our other SEC documents.

The sales of Jakafi - demand size of Jakafi are increasing at a steady rate and we are very confident in the full-year net product revenue guidance of $315 million to $335 million. On the clinical side we\u2019re growing our portfolio; the PV filing is on track; we launched our Phase III program of ruxolitinib in patients with pancreatic cancer and randomized Phase 2 studies of ruxolitinib in patient with colorectal cancer or lung cancer and breast cancer has been initiated.","The IDO program is advancing; the ipilimumab combination Phase I\/II data would be presented at ASCO in a few weeks. And we\u2019re on track to begin the trial combining our IDO inhibitor 24360 with Merck\u2019s anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in the second quarter. Our selective JAK1 inhibitor 39110 is expected to begin the first of two Phase 2 trial in non-small cell lung cancer in the second quarter. And we have advanced our PI3-kinase delta inhibitor 40093 in our Phase 1 trial in combination with 39110 in B-lymphoid malignancies.","Novartis continues to progress INC280 our c-MET inhibitor and has initiated a second Phase 2 trial in c-MET positive\/EGFR-TKI-resistant non-small cell lung cancer. Our alliance with Lilly could deliver significant value for baricitinib our second JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor and we expect to see internal readout of results from the first of multiple trials in RA Phase 3 program this year, with data presentation to come in 2015. We also plan to initiate a Phase 2 trial of our second JAK1 inhibitor 47986 in rheumatoid arthritis by mid year.","Now let me turn to ASCO; we will have three important clinical data presentations and on Monday night following two of this presentation, we will host an investor event where we will discuss as a presentation of that day, so it\u2019s a recap results as well as the data that [inaudible] the role of JAK inhibition as a mechanism to target systemic and local inflammation. And 24360 and the role we see for IDO inhibition in immuno oncology, so that\u2019s for Monday.","And on Tuesday afternoon following our presentation of the results from RESPONSE the pivotal Phase 3 study in patient with uncontrolled polycythemia vera we will host a second IR event and Dr. Verstovsek will present the RESPONSE data so that will be coming in another few weeks from now, where we will have all of this important data that will be presented. Now Jim will provide more details around our commercial accomplishment with Jakafi.","James M. Daly","Thank you, Herv\u00e9 and good morning everyone. Our first quarter net product sales of $70 million reflect continued steady growth in underlying demand which was offset by one time seasonal impacts from price and inventory drawdown following inventory builds in the fourth quarter of last year. These impacts were anticipated and we remain confident in our full year guidance of $315 million to $335 million for net product revenue. Year-over-year net sales grew 44% and quarter-over-quarter sales declined 4% with the following components to change relative to the prior quarter.","Underlying demand as measured by bottles dispensed to patients grew by 6% consistent with growth relative to the same period last year. We are encouraged by this performance given that seasonality typically makes first quarter challenging for branded products due to the annual reset of deductibles, increased cost sharing while in the donut hole, and patients pulling forward January prescriptions into December. Net price declined by 4% reflecting a temporary increase in gross to net discounts driven by seasonal increases in Medicare Part D donut hole rebates reflecting a $3 million impasse.","As expected and communicated on the fourth quarter call, the inventory increase that occurred in the fourth quarter was given back in the first quarter. Inventory declined by 6% and we exited the first quarter at the lower end of the normal range of three to three and a half weeks. The dollar value decreased in inventory in the first quarter was approximately $4 million consistent with the inventory build in the fourth quarter. ","We believe the increase in underlying demand in the first quarter reflects continued solid execution of our commercial strategy to growth Jakafi in MF. Market research indicates that the expansion of our sales force, which was completed in the fourth quarter along with high impact educational programs have driven expanded depth and breadth of prescribing for Jakafi. ","Measures of specific progress were seen and an increased understanding of dosing and recognize that Jakafi works regardless of JAK2 V16F mutation status. The overall reimbursement environment for Jakafi continues to be favorable. The vast majority of payers manage Jakafi consistent with the label, and patients are able to successfully manage most prior authorization that exists. ","In the first quarter, we launched enhancements to our Incyte care patient support program. We remain committed to making this program second to none in terms of support levels, eligibility thresholds and either views to benefit both current MF patients and future PV patients. Our Jakafi net sales guidance assumes no meaningful contribution to revenues in 2014 from FDA approved indication in PV. We believe the PV indication will make a substantial contribution to Jakafi sales in 2015.","The addressable patient population for PV is larger than that of MF and lengthy treatment of PV is likely to be longer than MF. Based up on claims data there are at least hundred thousand PV patients diagnosed and treated in the U.S. 60% of them are currently on HU, or previously on HU. But this continued because of side effects, or lack of efficacy. We estimate that approximately 25,000 of these patients or one in four have inadequate response to or intolerant of HU and suffer from uncontrolled PV while on just available therapies.","We have always said that MPNs are just beginning. We have a deep pipeline of novel molecules and innovative programs that represents an exceptional opportunity to make a difference for patients. To discuss this in more detail I\u2019ll turn it over to Rich.","Richard S. Levy","Thanks, Jim. During the first quarter, we took several important steps forward to broaden and strengthen our JAK inhibitor programs. Our development efforts with Jakafi in myeloproliferative neoplasms continue to advance. In early March, response our Phase III registration study for polycythemia vera that is being conducted under an SPA readout and we announced top-line results were positive.","This study which compared ruxolitinib to best available therapy for patients with polycythemia vera who are resistant or intolerant to hydroxyurea, met its primary endpoint for achieving phlebotomy independence and reducing spleen volume by 35 percent or more. The safety profile of ruxolitinib was generally consistent with previous studies.","Given the positive results, we remain on track to submit the sNDA this June. Our second Phase III study in patients with PV a double-blind study called RELIEF is measuring disease related symptoms and data are expected mid-year. Our goal is to submit full results from RELIEF for presentation at ASH in December and to submit sNDA label update on symptomatic benefit shortly after our expected approval of the PV indication.","I will next turn to our development efforts focusing on JAK inhibition in solid tumors. Previously reported that the results from the Phase II double-blind RECAP trial in second line pancreatic cancer showed a hazard ratio for overall survival of 0.47 favoring the ruxolitinib arm in a prospectively defined subgroup of patients.","We will discuss these data and the subgroup in greater detail at ASCO during both the oral presentation as well as in our Monday evening investor event. At that event we will also describe in detail the mechanistic rationale for JAK inhibition and solid tumors as well as the clinical basis for our patient selection methodology.","We are moving forward with randomized survival studies not only in pancreatic cancer, but also in several other solid tumors. Our first and most advanced program is in pancreatic cancer. In March, we randomized and started treatment of the first patient in Janus 1, a double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III trial in the second line setting evaluating ruxolitinib versus placebo on a background of capecitabine, this is being conducted under a Special Protocol Assessment.","A second nearly identical trial Janus 2 is planned to begin within the next two months. Each trial will enroll approximately 300 patients who meet the criteria for the subgroup defined in the RECAP trial. And the primary endpoints will be overall survival. We\u2019ve also started screening in our double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase II trials in non-small cell lung cancer and breast cancer and have started treatment in the first patients in our colorectal cancer study involved with ruxolitinib.","The breast and lung cancer studies will focus exclusively on the subgroup identified in RECAP. The breast cancer study will compared ruxolitinib plus capecitabine, to capecitabine plus placebo with the 148 patients. The lung cancer study will compare ruxolitinib plus pemetrexed and cisplatin, to pemetrexed\/cisplatin plus placebo, in a 156 patients.","The colorectal cancer study will compare ruxolitinib plus regorafenib to regorafenib plus placebo and will also enroll parallel group that does meet the subgroup criteria with the aim of demonstrating the differential benefit of ruxolitinib in the subgroup identified in RECAP.","However the primary endpoint will be based only on the patients in the selected subgroup, this study will enroll 373 patients. We are also planning to evaluate our lead JAK1 inhibitor 39110 and solid tumor starting with two blinded Phase II studies in non-small cell lung cancer, again with overall survival as the primary end point for both studies. The first study is planned to initiate in the second quarter, and the second study is expected to initiate later this year.","I\u2019ll now turn to our IDO1 inhibitor 24360, a mechanism that we think may provide meaning therapeutic approach in the immuno-oncology field. We know that IDO1 inhibitors can provide antitumor fact in relevant preclinical models as monotherapy and we combined with checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-CTLA4, anti-PD-1, or PD-L1 significant synergy has been achieved.","We look-forward to presenting the results of the ongoing uncontrolled dose-finding portion of our Phase I\/II study of 24360, in combination with the approved anti-CTLA4, antibody, ipilimumab in melanoma at ASCO the data from which continue to be encouraging.","In addition, we will soon initiative our first combination study with Merck\u2019s anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, MK-3475. Under the terms of non exclusive clinical collaboration agreement, Incyte and Merck will co-fund the Phase I\/II study in patients of previously treated metastatic and non-recurrent non-small cell lung cancer as well as other metastatic cancers.","The Phase I portion should define a recommended regimen for the two combined agents in patients for their range of solid tumors, and the Phase II portion will evaluate efficacy and safety that recommended regimen and a randomize population of non-small cell lung cancer patients where all patients receive MK-3475, combined with either our IDO1 inhibitors 24360 or placebo. Incyte will conduct the study, though the design of the study was done in close collaboration with Merck.","IND has been cleared by the FDA and the trial should begin enrolling patients by mid year. We also have additional opportunities to combine our drugs when preclinical data suggest the combination they have additional clinical benefits. The first such targeted combination that were currently evaluating in a clinical trail is with our JAK1 inhibitor, 39110 and our PI3K-delta inhibitor 40093 in patients with B-lymphoid malignancies. Both are distinct mechanism study different synergy and preclinical study and lymphoma.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dave.","David C. Hastings","Thanks, Rich. Good morning everybody. Let\u2019s begin with Jakafi for which we recorded $69.7 million first quarter net product revenues. Additionally, we reported $9.8 million in product royalties from Novartis for sales of Jakafi outside the United States. We also recorded as a part of contract revenue in the first quarter, a $7 million milestone from Novartis based on the formal initiation of a Phase II clinical study with c-MET inhibitor INC280 and c-MET positive\/EGFR-TKI-resistant non-small cell lung cancer. ","Our gross to net adjustment for product revenue recognized was approximately $9.6 million or 12.1% for the first quarter. As I mentioned in our last call, we expected our gross to net adjustment to be higher in the first quarter than the rest of the year primarily because of our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients. We still expect that our full year gross to net adjustment will range from 9% to 10%. Our cost of goods sold for the first quarter was immaterial as we continue to benefit from the fact that our starting finished goods inventory was previously expensed as R&D prior to FDA approval. In terms of operating expenses, both R&D and SG&A were within our expectations. ","From a cash perspective, we ended the quarter with $519 million in cash; our multiple and increasing sources of cash flows from net product sales, milestones and royalties and our stable cash position give us the ability to continue to invest in our PV launch activities and fund our expanding high potential pipeline.","So, with that operator, that concludes our formal remarks. And let\u2019s open the call for our Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question today is coming from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your questions.","Whitney Ijem \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Good morning, this is Whitney on for Cory this morning. Two quick IDO questions for you. First, can you give us any more detail in terms of how many patients will see data on at ASCO or how many cohorts have been enrolled? And then also if you can give us any detail on what data we should be expecting in the abstract to sort of in terms of types of data versus the poster?","Richard S. Levy","","Sure. So, I mean you didn't say it but I'm pretty certain that you are talking about the IDO studies. So in the abstract we will have results of the patients who were first started at 300 milligrams and even though that dose was not tolerated we\u2019ll present some data - there is data in the abstract on those patients. Then we went down to 25 milligrams twice a day. There were eight patients in that cohort and that is the data that is in the abstract. At the actual presentation we will also have results of the 15 milligrams BID cohort, which adds about another seven or eight patients. So, altogether there is a number of patients. But there will definitely be some additional data from the higher dose cohort in the presentation that is in the abstract that we expect to come out around two weeks from now.","Whitney Ijem \u2013 JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Got it. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is from Matt Roden from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Matt M. Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Great, good morning and thanks for having me on the call. I would like to ask a commercial question and then a pipeline follow-up if I may. So first on the commercial, Jim, could you maybe amplify your comments on Jakafi demand in terms of new patient starts and persistency rates? And perhaps whether or not there is any perspective on April trends.","James M. Daly","","Sure Matt. As we look at the underlying demand trends in the first quarter, they're rock solid. Again 6% dispensed again that\u2019s dispensed to patients very consistent with what we saw same period last year, quite consistent with what we saw quite frankly in the fourth quarter. We are seeing expansion of new prescribers. And quite frankly we are seeing those trends persist through April. So we\u2019ve had a strong April, so we feel that the impacts that we felt in the first quarter were seasonal and the underlying business remains robust.","Matt M. Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Jim, if the gross to net and inventory normalizes here, to what extent should we expect a snapback in reported sales in 2Q and then lastly, can I just gauge your level of confidence in the guidance range?","James M. Daly","","Sure, well as you know, patients, particularly when you have a branded product with a significant Medicare part D component, patients do have a tendency to try and pull forward prescriptions from January into December, but that effect only lasts for month and you\u2019d expect to see that bounceback. We are seeing that. Price was kind of a wind in our face in the first quarter. We had gross to net of 8% in the fourth quarter. We jumped to 12% in the first quarter. But as Dave guided 9 to 10 for the year, we expect that to come down so price will certainly be a wind in our back. Plus we took price increase on April 1. So we expect to have - and we think we ended the quarter at the low-end of the normal range of inventory. So we have got all drivers going in the right direction in the second quarter so we think we're going to have a very strong second quarter.","Matt M. Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Sorry, go ahead on the guidance.","James M. Daly","Yes, the implication for the guidance, Matt quite frankly, we are more confident in the guidance we issued on the fourth quarter call now than we were when we issued it. We're feeling really good about where the business is. We've got a lot of momentum, and we have very high level of conviction in the current guidance.","Matt M. Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay, and then one follow-up on the pipeline if I may. Rich, I wanted to get your perspective on the SPA on the Jakafi Janus study. So on one hand you could say it\u2019s not terribly groundbreaking to have an SPA for survival trial in cancer. But is the right interpretation of the SPA, is that the regulators thought that the onco information approach is clinically real and significant, and does this represent a sort of a blessing of the subgroup and imply the regulators are buying into the mechanism based on the data?","Richard S. Levy","","So clearly there is buy-in to the subgroup. That was not an issue and we have in writing that we don't need to study the other subgroup et cetera, et cetera. With respect to how much FDA believes in the mechanism, I mean there a skeptical group is \u2013 in general when they say show me more data. So they have seen the early data and they said we need another trial and you would be better off following the regulations and doing two more trials just to be absolutely safe in case that results in the first of those trials is not quite as robust as what you saw in Phase II. So I mean that's about all I can say. The SPA was a process that we went through. Not because we wanted to get their buy-in that survival could be the primary endpoint, but to make sure that the subgroup was okay and that we didn't need to do any work to develop a companion diagnostic.","Matt M. Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thanks and congrats on all the pipeline progress.","Richard S. Levy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ian Somaiya from Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks, and I apologize in advance for the background noise. First question was on the Jakafi pancreatic cancer you made a presentation. Could you just give us some sense of what to expect, what additional [inaudible] the data we get, I know in the press release you shared with us [inaudible] in the survival across the two groups, are we just going to get an expansion of that to nine months plus or is there something more we should expect? And I have one follow-up.","Richard S. Levy","Okay, I can\u2019t go into detail as to what is going to be in the abstract\/presentation, I think the main difference that you will see from what\u2019s already out there is the identification of the subgroup. I don't remember the abstract per se to remember what else is in there. But there is more information than was simply in the press release that we issued before. And then the actual presentation will obviously go beyond the abstract and I think importantly the investor event that we will do that evening will include additional presentations that go beyond the actual results of the RECAP study to include background on historical data, on selection of the subgroup and why we are confident of this is not only real here in pancreatic cancer, but other solid tumors as well. As well as more on the scientific background on the whole theory and evidence behind onco inflammation as a therapeutic target with Jakafi [inaudible].","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. And just one follow-up was on the combination study you are running [inaudible] B-cell lymphoma, PI3K-delta and JAK1. Just intrigued by the combination of that mechanism and I was wondering if there are any subgroups that you have identified or [inaudible] in that trial like you did in the RECAP study.","James M. Daly","","So, right now we are still in the dose finding portion of that study. And so we generally in this case as well, try to get through dose finding with a broad population of patients until we get to the drug levels where we are confident that we really want to be focusing on potential subgroups that may be best. In that study, we are not focusing on the same subgroup as in the solid tumors although that is a possibility for later on. And I\u2019d ask Reid if you want to add anything to this.","Reid M. Huber","","Yes, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d add in EM is that we have some degree of interest of course in the ABC subtypes just given the background biology of JAK start signaling there, and some of the emerging data with these receptor inhibition, but I think our preclinical data suggests that the combination could have utility outside of the subgroup. And so just to amplify Rich\u2019s statement that\u2019s one of the underlying reasons why enrolling a broader set of patients and surveying activity kind of more broad set early on is important to us. Because I think that\u2019s driven by part of the underlying thinking in the biology.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","","Okay. Can you just give us a sense for what the likely next steps are going to be for that program for that combination?","David C. Hastings","","Sure. We\u2019ve already established with monotherapy with 4093 that we\u2019re able to get safely to levels that inhibit the target by over 90% throughout the dosing interval. We then took a step back, when we added in combination with the JAK1 inhibitor and we want to get up to at least that level. Then there are several expansion cohorts in different patient populations which are not really ready to discuss at this time. But Reid also mentioned for example the ABC subtype of DLBCL. It\u2019s something that we are interested in. And that will potentially give us, answers to whether or not we want to move forward to potential Phase II or even registration trials in some of those B-cell malignancies with that combination.","James M. Daly","","I would rather just get offline.","","David C. Hastings","","Greater details until a later time.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","","Okay. Thank you, very much.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian C. Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on all the commercial and pipeline progress. Question on PV to start I never going to see the full data in a couple of weeks, but is there anything I guess qualitative that you can talk about that you learned about Jakafi\u2019s benefits in treating PV from the response study compared to what we already knew from the phase II experience, and you guys seem pretty confident in the potential positioning once this has approved next year. And then I'm curious also if you\u2019re starting to see any uptick in our flavor used or I guess more relaxed restrictions from insurers since the top line, positive topline data is come out and then in a quick pipeline follow up thanks.","James M. Daly","","Brian this is Jim, I will take the second question first which is we\u2019ve seen just a very gradual increase and the percent of use that is non-MF I think we have 12% non-MF in the fourth quarter and that\u2019s gone to 13% in the first quarter, so no meaningful change.","Richard S. Levy","So I have to be careful what I say here because the data is not out yet. There are some differences between the designs of the trials more so then there are differences in the results of the trials. So for example in the Phase 2 trial we look at (indiscernible) by patient not by MRI, where is to get MRI in Phase 3. We had a running period where we got people into a therapeutic range for their hermetic within the Phase 2 trial. And then look for phlebotomy eligibility where as the Phase 2 we just took them where they were. So there are going to be some difference based on the designs of the trials but I don\u2019t think quantitatively or qualitatively they indicate anything different. ","Obviously the Phase 3 trial is larger and that gives us an ability to start looking at certain things that we had no potential to look at in Phase 2 including for example even though the rates are low, rates of the thrombosis in the different arms of the trial which you trying to keep them rate down in order to be able to avoid thrombosis but actually doing thrombosis trials is way too long and too larger in the FDA we didn\u2019t need to do that but within this larger study with patient study is longer we can start to get a hint at some of that data as well.","Brian C. Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thanks Richard, that\u2019s really helpful and just a quick follow up you mentioned I don\u2019t think Lily\u2019s recently mentioned that will see some of the Phase 3 data comparison that rolling up by the end of this year can you possibly clarify which of the studies, which study or studies we might see and is there anything you\u2019re waiting to see from those readouts prior to starting the Phase 2 for 986 in RA? Thanks.","Richard S. Levy","The answer is. I do know which trials are likely to readout this year but I\u2019m not at liberty to get any information on Lily\u2019s programs at this time they really are in control of the message on this one and we just what we said is what we\u2019re allowed to say at this point of time.","","Brian C. Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, sure enough in terms of gaining practice for 986 and anything you are looking for in those studies if we start 96.","Richard S. Levy","","No, that study is pretty much ready to start we have an investigator\u2019s meeting coming up and then patients will start enrolling protocol has finalized, the IND is clear that\u2019s pretty much ready to go.","Brian C. Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Great, thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your questions.","Eric T. Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question maybe a big picture question for Herv\u00e9 and it looks like you\u2019re planning quite a show at ASCO with two analyst meetings one focused on JAK\u2019s and solid tumors and IDO. Is there one, two points that you want investors to take home from that Analyst meeting on JAK\u2019s and solid tumors and IDO what would they be.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Well the reason we do two meetings is frankly, mostly practical because two of the presentations on Monday and I know many of you in fact may not say on Tuesday so what we wanted to do is to do meeting on Monday evening to discuss IDO and onco inflammation. I think obviously the data itself is going to be a big part of this meeting, but in addition to the data, what we would like to discuss with all of you is also the scientific rationale behind onco inflammation and the fact that there is a mechanism there that is fairly you where very few companies are involved and we are in the lead. And it is our responsibility to clarify for everybody what is the science behind the mechanism of external of the drug like Jakafi in study tumors. For IDO obviously the data that would be for the disclosed for the first time and then we\u2019ll be discussing also the status of the program and how we see combinations being that keep up as the next steps for this product.","Eric T. Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Thomas Wei from Jefferies. Please proceed with our question.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thanks, just a couple on 360. Just to clarify how many were at 300 milligrams?","David C. Hastings","I would it\u2019s probably about somewhere in the range of six, but I just don't have that number in my head.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Fair it\u2019s\u2026","Richard S. Levy","","Herv\u00e9\u2019s would bring to me the key things that was seven.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay, so it might be seven, eight and then seven or eight. So when you total what we may get around 22 or 23 patients presented at ASCO in the actual presentation, is that right?","Richard S. Levy","","Yes.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","And can you give us a sense because of the disparity of the doses here, when you talk about having a positive view on the efficacy signals, you are talking about a kind of all doses here. This isn\u2019t something that\u2019s being driven by the data 300 milligrams.","Richard S. Levy","","Absolutely not, I mean that would be I couldn\u2019t say pass the red base test, so we have a non-tolerated dose that works and tolerated doses was that are not working. So yes, our excitement that we had and communicated in the past was based on the results that we were seeing a 25 milligrams. The b.i.d. that we had before we submitted the abstract that includes the data 25 b.i.d.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","And you\u2019ve talked about showing data on response rates and progression free survival and overall survival. Can you say, are we going to see some data on things like that\u2019s response at the ASCO presentation?","Richard S. Levy","So, two things, one I think so, but we haven\u2019t finalized the presentations yet. But I think we're going to probably show a waterfall plot were you show the depth of response on each individual patient within certain groups. And second as I tried to say, we have survival data. I'm not sure what we're going to do with that because in this era, patients who fail this combination may go on to things like PD1 inhibitors, which that was not true and at the time when ipilimumab and monotherapy was being first studied. And so that could be overly misleading to suggest something that we don\u2019t know was related to the drug per se. But time to progression or time to change in regimen as a measure of progression is some thing that we believe is interesting data and will be included in the presentation.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","And then just lastly that the Merck, Lambro combination study, given the huge range of doses that you have looked at historically where doesn\u2019t in the 300 milligrams maybe being a very specific toxicity issue with it be. Is the plan to stick to the 2550 end of the range with Lambro or to start there and to go all the way up to the original proposed 300 mg? Or how should we think about that and how many doses might this early Phase 1 part actually end up exploring?","Richard S. Levy","","Yes, so I think we went to 600 and 900 originally with monotherapy and that was way higher than we needed to be. And I agree with you that we believe that the combination toxicity data is largely \u2013 is the combination issue and most likely not a PD-1 or PD-L1 combination issue. But we have to generate the data to do that. So we are going to start relatively low. And work our way up. But I don't think that anyone has to be that there is a need to take the amount of time it would take to get all the way up to 300 mg dose again, because when we look at this, we said in the range of 25 to 50 mg BID gives about all the efficacy that you see in the preclinical model.","So, we would like to have some buffer there above that's that every patient remains in that therapeutic range. And so I don't think it's the case that we are going to have to go gradually from 25 BID as an example of the starting point all the way up to 300. But, the protocol probably allows us to continue to go, but I think that we probably won't go past a few doses.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co."," ","Thanks, that\u2019s very helpful.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Schmidt from Leerink. Please proceed with your question.","Michael W. Schmidt \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one bigger picture question on the IDO inhibitor, so would be we don\u2019t call it\u2019s your landscape evolving rapidly and becoming fairly competitive and some of the indications, what is your overall philosophy in driving development for 20, 40, 60 forward in certain indications versus others. And then I had a follow-up.","James M. Daly","So, we\u2019re looking at a broad range of options. With respect to the PD-1 or PD-L1 targets. We think those are very good drugs and but in many of the indications there is evidence of efficacy but not for example as strong as they are in melanoma. And so, what we're really looking for primarily is indications in which we know that the mechanism is active but for which there is a significant room for improvement that could be demonstrated in moderately sized registration trials. We also continue to look at opportunities for other combinations outside of PD-1, PD-L1 potentially with things like ipilimumab potentially with things like vaccines and potentially with some of the other novel targets that are coming forward in immuno oncology.","Michael W. Schmidt \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC","Got it. And with regards to PV and the Novartis collaboration, have you disclosed what level or what types of milestone payments are tied to the PV approval launch?","James M. Daly","Yeah, they are very typical milestones you see in these types of collaborations. Obviously a key events such as approval and pricing reimbursement in their territory would be the most obvious.","Michael W. Schmidt \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC","","Okay, great. And then the last one on Lilly. Are you aware of development plans for baricitinib, outside RA on parts of Lilly?","James M. Daly","So, what has been publicly announced is that they're doing Phase II trials and psoriasis and diabetic nephropathy and they have not said anything beyond those two indications.","Michael W. Schmidt \u2013 Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Navdeep Singh from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi, good morning guys, and thanks for taking my questions. Just few questions, so maybe I\u2019ll start off with a question on Jakafi given the recent increase in \u2013 cost of our drugs including oncology drug is that, obviously from pricing power, do you believe you have the Jakafi in the U.S. I thought that you took another 5% increase at the end of Q1. And then I have a follow-up question on IDOl inhibitor. Thanks.","David C. Hastings","It was 4.75, and I think most of the peers are focused on the larger use areas where you have a small indication with the survival benefit with data suggesting supportive of the survival benefit. We\u2019ve had minimal pushback from payers regarding the value proposition for Jakafi.","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, great. And then question on IDO1 inhibitor, so are you guys considering it all that are computing IDO1 inhibitor maybe a little to enter into an exclusive deal with Merck or any other form if you report a pretty compiling data from your study evaluating IDO1 inhibitor plus the Merck PD-1 antibody, and is there anything that you can prevent Merck from taking such a path?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","I would say that important thing that can prevent anybody from taking such a path, the reality of the field of IDO is that we are well ahead of the competition and that\u2019s what we intend to continue, where we intend to continue to be. So we don\u2019t see that as a circumstantial issue.","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Goldman Sachs ","","Okay. Thanks a lot, Herv\u00e9.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So based on your understanding of the biology the JAK signaling pathways, do you hypothesize that there is a role for the JAK2 inhibition in the solid tumors or do think it\u2019s more neutral in its effects and\/or could the subgroup potentially remove a detrimental effect?","Reid M. Huber","","Yes. So I think \u2013 this is Reid. The question asked to the relevance of JAK2 in the inventory activity to the date that we\u2019re kind of present at ASCO around RECAP. I think it\u2019s still an open question, but we have some perspective that really are driving are more balanced approach in the development program or it involves bringing \u2013 when possible. And also taking JAK1 and I feel there are no compounds forward.","The data that will describe particularly at the investor event at ASCO will go into some detail as to which side of kinds are believe to play the most important driving roll in both local and information of the material microenvironment as well as systemically with any manifest and some of the metabolic inhibitor we\u2019ve seen in advanced malignancy.","The majority of that data I think it\u2019s fair to say and support an important role for JAK1 single link and therefore likely an important role JAK1 inhibition and the benefits that we see in pancreatic cancer and that underlies the rationale and other tumor types. JAK2 can play a role in some cell types (indiscernible) cells and things like that, it maybe the importance of JAK2 activity is more histology dependent these are all things that we\u2019re going to have to explore with the development program and really underlie our view that where we can take ruxolitinib forward and regimens that are not overly myelosuppressive will do that and in histologies and regimens were we otherwise couldn\u2019t take ruxolitinib and that's a good place to explore JAK1 and are thinking about all of these things above over time.","Steve Byrne \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","And just a follow up for you Jim, you mentioned the price increase from March it was roughly half the prior price increase. Do you anticipate shortening the interval between price increases, as this is changing your pricing strategy?","James M. Daly","","Steve, at a general policy we don\u2019t comment on forward pricing actions but if you look at oral oncolytics there is a growing practice to move toward twice a year pricing actions.","Steve Byrne \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Okay, thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Josh Schimmer from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Josh E. Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","Thanks for taking the questions. First on the IDO inhibitor program, do plan to pursue additional studies in combination with ipilimumab and what is the rationale for expecting synergy with PD1 antibodies in order to what we seen with\u2026","James M. Daly","","So we\u2019re exploring all options we clearly are focused on the PD1\u2019s including the study with Merck if there is an opportunity with ipilimumab that is not already potentially taken by a PD1 we would certainly be interested in exploring that so we\u2019ve not closed the door on anything and I\u2019ll turn the second question over to Reid.","Reid M. Huber","","Yes, so Josh, this is not been published work conducted in collaboration with Tom Gajewski University of Chicago and is also been a study published using the IDO1 knock out mouse. But describe some of the pharmacology with combined inhibitation or loss of IDO1 and PD-1, PD-L1 blockade. And I think to summarize it briefly these are mechanistically distinct intervention points they target different aspects of the negative regulation of anti-tumor immune response and taking off IDO1 is a break and ipilimumab activity is reflected of two distinct therapeutic approaches that can give you synergy and very similarly being IDO1 and antagonizing PD1 gives you a very similar pharmacologic effect overall so I think basically these are multiple independent points on a cascade and your ability to achieve synergy is very clear pre-clinically when you take up multiple breaks.","Josh E. Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","","Great, and then Jakafi and other solid tumor indication among breast and colorectal what percent of those patients shared (indiscernible) future segment pancreatic cancer. And I wasn\u2019t clear would those patients enrolled in those Phase 3 trials those upper patients or is that is the broad patient population?","James M. Daly","So we\u2019ll get into that more detail when we actually do our Investor meeting when we actually disclose the subgroup. But I mean I will say that probably the breast cancer patients which is probably the largest of the indication has a lower percentage on that would meet the subgroup. But we should have no trouble finding them because there are so many of these breast cancer patients. And what was your second part of the question.","Josh E. Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","","When the trials will specifically only include those subgroup patients or whether enrolled.","James M. Daly","Right so as I try to get across in my prepared remarks, the lung cancer and breast cancer studies are only in the subgroup. The colon cancer includes two groups. Those that meet this definition and those do not but the primary endpoint in the colon cancer study is based on those patients that are in that subgroup. We felt that it was important to demonstrate that this subgroup was not only predictive in pancreatic cancer but in at least one other tumor type. And we choose to do that, within colon cancer because this study which is on top of survivor or Regorafenib the very advanced patient population, positive trial there has some potential to be a registration trial. And so we wanted to make sure that we were kicking the box of showing that this predictor that we saw confirmed in pancreatic cancer was also confirmed in one of the tumor types. We don't feel that it, we show that in both pancreatic and colon that we would need to show in other types. And that\u2019s kind of the reason why that study is bigger.","Josh E. Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray & Co","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ying Huang from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Murphy, thanks for taking my questions. I had one for IDO first so obviously the investors have been focusing clearly on the response rate you reported at ASCO. I want to - probably your thoughts on the relationship between response rate, and then eventually will see hopefully a PFS and OS benefit, in this combination IDO inhibitor and (indiscernible) inhibitor here. And then secondly, what is the difference in product code for the JANUS1 and JANUS2 trial for the Phase III pancreatic cancer trial. And then does the SPA you reached with FDA stipulate the you have to meet survival end points for both? Thanks.","Richard S. Levy","","Okay. You may have to remind me of all of the questions again. So let me start backwards. So the SPA does not say that we need to have two positive trials the FDA is around the design of the first trial and that the communications with the FDA or the results of that one trial are robust, that that may be sufficient. But we were advised to do a second trial in case the results of this trial are not as strong as in the Phase II trial.","In terms of response rates progression free survival, survival, et cetera. So it\u2019s clear that there are long lived patients who are not responders to immunotherapies. But I think it is a good thing to start with the real responses, including as you have seen with the PD1 some pretty deep responses in terms of the percent change in tumor volume. The second thing is that we will present data on the duration of response in some of these patients and compared to historical data with ipilimumab.","So I think that response and time to progression, and again survival data is just biased in our favor and that's why no one should think that we don\u2019t think a survival is good, It's just that if someone has progressed and they go to another therapy that did not exist before, it's just hard to compare, we don\u2019t want to take credit where it may not be real yet. So I would look at this as an early study for which you have where you are limited in terms of some of the things that you have like what is the long-term survival in and patients. But from what we have, I think it\u2019s remains supportive that we are looking at something that is encouraging, something that is clearly better than ipilimumab monotherapy and will obviously reserve further comments and how this may compare to PD-1 in melanoma until you see the data","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","And can you remind us where it is a new product or different between Janus 1 and Janus 2 trial?","Richard S. Levy","I\u2019m sorry. So the differences are number one that we are looking at symptoms of pancreatic cancer in Janus 2, but not in Janus 1, but that still only an exploratory end point there to try to fully evaluate potential patient for the outcome that could be supplemental labeling statement at a later time. The second thing is the Janus 1 is a little bit larger than Janus 2 not by a lot simply because the only real role for Janus 2 will be a Janus 1 is not sufficiently robust that we need the second positive trial, so it\u2019s a little bit smaller otherwise the designs are pretty much identical.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Liisa Bayko from JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Liisa A. Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","Hi, thanks for taking my question, just a follow-up some what you were saying earlier I know the colorectal study for Jakafi is large and therefore could be eligible for registration can you will be comment on that for the long? What would be necessary if that result we got here could those be included in the label eventually?","Richard S. Levy","","So, first I don\u2019t want to set expectations that the colorectal cancer study is a registration study and this is an expectation that we get approved that study is positive, we\u2019re saying results of that are sufficiently robust and considering that there are no options for those patients possibility. With the respect to the breast and non-small cell there is no possibility in my mind and those studies would actually be the registration studies, but whether if we then went on to a subsequent study, the results of those earlier Phase II studies could also be included in the eventual label that remains a possibility.","Liisa A. Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","Okay, great and then just a quick question. I noticed you sort of modify the language around PV a little bit use to be sort of retrofit and tolerant and you are talking a little bit more now, but qualifying that uncontrolled does there any sort of meaningful difference behind that?","Richard S. Levy","","No Liisa we\u2019re going through a translation process right now I think which the team translated Phase II to Phase III now we have translate Phase III to a label and then as a commercial team we will translate that to messages then we will ultimately translate that into treated patients. So the normal criteria is evolving as we go through those translation processes.","Liisa A. Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","Okay, great. And then can you maybe talk a little bit about market readiness I know that was slight issue for Jakafi and MF what do you doing in PV now just sort of lay the foundation that\u2019s my last question? Thank you.","Richard S. Levy","Liisa I want get into explicit details, but I want to assure you that we\u2019re doing everything that should be done that can be down in order to climb the market in a complaint manner. So that we have a higher compression launch for PV, so it will be a launch executed in a highly professional manner, and our goal is to make sure that the patients who need this product get it as quickly as possible and we are confident, we are going to do that.","Liisa A. Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Boris Peaker from Oppenheimer. Please proceed with your question.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","","Yes, good morning, thank you for taking my questions. My first question is on Jakafi, you mentioned that the colorectal study is going to be the second study to somewhat validate the biomarker. I am just curious is that colorectal study does not support the biomarker I mean how would that impact some of the other studies where you\u2019re ready selecting only biomarker positive patients.","James M. Daly","So, I mean I think that, really is going to be indication by indication. And the data that we saw in pancreatic cancer is pretty convincing that this is real. But it was based on hypothesis that goes back in the literature from many years with tens of thousands of patients supporting that this is an important factor. Anyone study is not necessarily going to negotiate that the totality of that data. And so I certainly don't think it would have any impact on the approval in pancreatic cancer. And if we saw good results for example, in both of the patients that were in this group and those were not in the group. In colon cancer, my preference would be the same, the good in both groups and maybe there's another reason why that drug works in colon cancer. Anything can happen within individual study and that's why you have to do the study is to really know.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Correct. And my second question is on IDO. I\u2019m just curious are you in active discussion for additional potential combinations for your IDO compound and it\u2019s so all these partnerships specifically maybe waiting for the ASCO data would have been prior to pulling the trigger on some other IDO combo.","James M. Daly","Yes, we already have two discussions with other manufactures. So we have PD-1s, PD-L1s and there are not gated to any other particular data release.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","","Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","","Thank you, we have reached end of our question-and-answer session I would like to turn the call back over to management team for further any closing comments.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Okay, thank you. Thank you for attending this call. Obviously, as you see, I mean we have had a very strong Q1 on the development side and on the commercial side. So I think it can be looked at as a very good step for the organization and the next big one would be at ASCO. So I hope to see you all at our ASCO Investor meeting.

At this time all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mike Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Diego. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's third quarter 2017 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com. And I'm joined on the call today by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Steven, Dave, and Reid.","We would like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2017 guidance, the commercialization of our products, and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline, as well as the development plans for our collaboration partners.","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2017 and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents.","I'd now like to pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for his introductory remarks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. So I'm very pleased to report another very successful quarter at Incyte with dynamic revenue growth, driven by sales of both Jakafi and Iclusig, and with significant progress in multiple places in our clinical development portfolio.","So let's begin with Q3 revenue. So you can see on slide 5, remarkable growth in product-related revenue over the past five years. So, that's revenue without the milestone, which has seen a compounded annual growth rate of more than 50%. Five years ago, Incyte's product-related revenue was made of Jakafi's sales and Jakavi royalties in myelofibrosis and we have come a long way since then. Jakafi sales and royalties remains a key component of our revenue growth, and Iclusig sales and Olumiant royalties are now adding to it. We believe Incyte is in a unique position, combining strong revenue growth with a cutting edge portfolio of project at every stage of development.","And I will now spend a few minutes in our late stage development portfolio. So, slide 6 summarizes the late-stage project and the indication being pursued. Pivotal program for ruxolitinib are open in both steroid refractory GVHD and essential thrombocythemia, and itacitinib is also in the pivotal program for GVHD. Recruitment is proceeding well in our two key FGFR trial and our PI 3-kinase delta program is also moving forward where we are opening trial in four different non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. And of course, the ECHO program for epacadostat continues to progress and we are looking forward to the readout of the pivotal ECHO-301 trial in melanoma expected in the first half of 2018. I believe that over the next five years, these five listed product candidates have the potential to further accelerate our revenue growth and we look forward to reporting on future developments.","So, on slide 7, you see our leadership position in immuno-oncology is driven by our roots in immunology research; and we consider our ongoing epacadostat plus PD-1 collaboration to be only the beginning for us in this field. Our discovery and development teams now have many candidates in the clinic to explore the I-O space, such as IDO1, obviously, arginase, JAK1, bromodomain, and PI 3-kinase delta inhibitors, as well as our GITR and OX40 antagonist.","We have recently announced two new collaborations that we believe will serve to further enhance our immuno-oncology portfolio, and I'll touch on this on slides 8 and 9. On slide 8, you can see that we have agreed with AstraZeneca to expand our existing clinical collaboration and move into Phase 3 development in a trial which will study epacadostat plus durvalumab in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. This study builds on AstraZeneca's recent success in the PACIFIC study, and the objective of the study is to establish a new standard of care in the same patient population as was studied in PACIFIC. We will share the cost of the trial with AstraZeneca, and the trial is expected to begin in the first half of next year.","We are also excited to announce, last week, we did \u2013 that we have entered into a global collaboration and license agreement with MacroGenics for its PD-1 antogonist MGA012, which is already in the clinic. Under the agreement, Incyte will hold exclusive world-wide development and commercialization rights in all indications, and Incyte will record all global sales for the compound.","As you can see here on slide 9, we have a total of seven in-house assets today that has the potential to be combined with the PD-1 antagonist and are currently in Phase 1 PD-1 combination trial, and we intend to proceed into combination trial with MGA012 as soon as possible. Yet, what is different about this collaboration is that the agreement also grants MacroGenics the right to develop MGA012 in combination with its own pipeline. And we believe that this innovative collaboration structure with MacroGenics provides us with significant optionality and may increase the compounds' commercial potential.","Now on slide 10. Drug discovery remains central at Incyte and we have successfully added two large molecule discovery alliances to our small molecule expertise, one for monoclonal and one for bispecific antibody. These three platforms are expected to enable us to go after a multitude of future target. We have five late-stage program within our development portfolio and it originate for what could potentially be a good number of new products and new indication approval, we now have operation in the U.S., Europe and Japan as we continue to build Incyte into a world-class biopharmaceutical company.","As part of this process, we are also very pleased to have Jackie Fouse join our Board of Directors. Jackie has extensive experience in oncology and in the biopharma field and she will be a wonderful addition to our team.","With that, I'll pass the call to Barry for an update on Jakafi.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. Jakafi net sales were strong in Q3 of 2017 at $304 million, a 36% increase over Q3 2016 and a 10% increase over the second quarter of this year. Jakafi's performance in the quarter was driven by strong patient demand for both indications. We believe this demonstrates our approach of educating physicians on the benefits of intervening early with Jakafi therapy and supporting patients through our educational and awareness initiatives, continues to be very effective.","We did see some inventory builds in Q3 which is now slightly above the high-end of our typical range of two and a half to three weeks. In dollar amounts, this inventory represents approximately $5 million of net sales. As a result of our strong sales growth, we are revising our full-year 2017 net product revenue guidance for Jakafi from a range of $1.090 billion to $1.120 billion to a new range of $1.125 billion to $1.135 billion.","I'd like to take a moment to remind everyone of the long-term revenue potential of Jakafi beyond MF and PD. Jakafi also has potential to benefit patients with graft-versus-host disease an underserved community of patients, who may have been cured of their cancer by a stem cell transplant, only to suffer a side effect of that treatment resulting in GVHD. Data from REACH1 in steroid-refractory acute GVHD are expected in the first half of next year. And if the results are positive, we expect to be able to file an sNDA for Jakafi in this indication in 2018.","We have also opened a pivotal study in patients with essential thrombocythemia. Jakafi has already transformed the lives of thousands of patients with MPNs, and we continue to work with doctors, patients, patient advocacy groups and the FDA to further expand access to those who may be able to benefit from this treatment.","With that, I'll pass along the call to Steven for a clinical update.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. On Slide 15, I'd like to start by reminding you of the scope of our current pivotal program with epacadostat. As you are all aware, ECHO-301 is ongoing in patients with unresectable or metastatic melanoma. The trial has completed enrollment and we are now waiting for events to accrue. We remain on track to announce results in the first half of 2018.","Earlier this year, we announced that we would be expanding the epacadostat program to include pivotal trials in four additional tumor types in combination with either Merck's pembrolizumab or Bristol's nivolumab. These studies are all on track to begin enrollment by the end of 2017. As Herv\u00e9 mentioned, we were pleased to announce that we are expanding further with a pivotal study in combination with AstraZeneca's durvalumab in patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer.","Our clinical development team along with our partners at Merck and Bristol are working hard to initiate the additional trials of epacadostat in combination with either pembrolizumab or nivolumab. The details of the renal and both lung studies with pembrolizumab are now available on ct.gov and we've summarized the trial schema for these studies on this slide, slide 16. All the three trials will be conducted in patients that are treatment na\u00efve for their advanced disease. ECHO-302 will study the combination of epacadostat and pembrolizumab in patients with renal cell carcinoma versus standard of care. In this case, either Sutent or Votrient in a simple two arm design.","ECHO-305 will study the combination of epacadostat and pembrolizumab in patients with PD-L1 high expression lung cancer versus pembrolizumab monotherapy. Pembrolizumab monotherapy is the care standard in this population.","ECHO-306 will evaluate patients with lung cancer irrespective of their PD-L1 status. The evolving care standard in this population is pembrolizumab plus platinum-doublet chemotherapy. And therefore, this is used as the comparator arm. We are also taking the opportunity in this study to investigate the possibility of a chemotherapy-free combination. And so we are not only including a triplet arm of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy, but also a third arm of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab. The co-primary endpoints for all three trials will be progression-free survival and overall survival.","Next, I'd like to spend a few minutes speaking about our other immuno-oncology assets and the significant progress we are making here. Our GITR agonist, INCAGN1876, and our OX40 agonist, INCAGN1949, have both completed dose escalation. Each of these candidates is now moving ahead in multiple combination cohorts. INCAGN1876 is in combination with epacadostat and pembrolizumab, and separately in combinations with nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab plus ipilimumab. INCAGN1949 is currently progressing into combinations with either nivolumab monotherapy or nivolumab plus ipilimumab.","Our first in class arginase inhibitor INCB1158 is continuing with dose escalation and has recently moved into combination studies with pembrolizumab. We also plan to evaluate INCB1158 in both epacadostat and chemotherapy-based combinations.","On slide 18, outside of immuno-oncology, we have what we believe is an exciting portfolio of targeted therapies. Over the last year, we have put together a broad program to study the effects of JAK inhibition for patients suffering from graft-versus-host disease. The program spans both acute and chronic graft-versus-host disease and will also evaluate various other treatment settings, such as prophylaxis for the condition, patients that are treatment na\u00efve, and patients that are steroid-refractory.","The first pivotal trial of ruxolitinib in graft-versus-host disease, REACH1 is evaluating ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory, acute graft-versus-host disease, and is expected to readout next year. The GRAVITAS-301 study was recently initiated and will evaluate itacitinib in patients with treatment-na\u00efve acute graft-versus-host disease.","On slide 19, I'd like to cover our other two late stage assets. Our selective FGFR1\/2\/3 inhibitor, INCB54828 is being evaluated in two key programs, one in metastatic bladder cancer, and then other in cholangiocarcinoma. These studies are recruiting well. Our highly selective PI 3-kinase delta inhibitor, INCB50465 is being studied in a broad program, which includes trials for a number of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Our program is additionally investigating dose and scheduling to maintain efficacy, while hopefully ameliorating toxicity.","On slide 20, I'll discuss some highlights from our upcoming news flow. As I've already mentioned, the additional Phase 3 studies with pembrolizumab and nivolumab are on track to begin by the end of this year. Also expected by the end of this year will be the first-in-man data from our lead BRD inhibitor, which will highlight the data we used to determine to prioritize development of INCB57643 over INCB54329. First-in-man data from our PIM inhibitor, INCB53914 is also expected later this year.","Heading into the first half of 2018, we are looking forward to the results of the ECHO-301 study, as well as the results from REACH1, our pivotal study of ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. Lastly, and following the new go forward decision with AstraZeneca, we expect to initiate a Phase 3 study of epacadostat in combination with durvalumab for the treatment of lung cancer patients in the first half of 2018. We've made significant advances in the clinics so far in 2017, and we have ambitious goals as we head into next year. We look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.","With that, I'll pass the call to Dave, for the financial update.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Steven. And good morning, everyone. Our financial performance in the third quarter was very strong. We recorded $382 million of total revenue. This was comprised of $304 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $18 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $41 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis, and $3 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly. In addition, we recorded a $15 million milestone related to the approval of Olumiant in Japan as contract revenue.","Jakafi's net product revenue of $304 million represents 36% growth over the same period at last year. Based on Jakafi's performance for the first nine months of the year, we are increasing our full-year Jakafi net product revenue guidance to a range of $1.125 billion to $1.135 billion.","Our gross-to-net adjustment for the third quarter was approximately 12%. We expect that the total gross-to-net adjustment for the full-year to be approximately 13%. Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $22 million. This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis on U.S. Jakafi net sales, and the amortization of acquired product rights related to the Iclusig product acquisition in Europe.","Our R&D expense for the quarter was $270 million, including $23 million in non-cash stock compensation and a $12 million in-process research and development asset impairment charge due to the discontinuation of the Iclusig second-line CML trial that began prior to the acquisition of the European ARIAD operations in 2016. The remaining increase in R&D expense over the previous quarter was driven by continued progress on the epacadostat Phase 3 studies, the advancement of ruxolitinib GVHD studies, and the expansion of studies in our large molecule programs.","For the full-year, we expect R&D expense to be in a range of $1.250 billion to $1.300 billion, of which approximately $360 million is related to the amended Agenus collaboration, and the Merus, Calithera, and MacroGenics collaborations. The increase in R&D expense guidance over the prior quarter is primarily related to the $150 million upfront payment under the recently announced license agreement with MacroGenics. Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $91 million, including $12 million in non-stock cash compensation.","We recorded a $16 million net benefit related to the change in the fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability. This net benefit included $8 million of recurring expense related to the change in the fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability, and a $24 million benefit related to the discontinued Iclusig second-line CML trial as previously mentioned. As a result, we expect full-year expense related to the change in fair market value of contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability to be in a range of $5 million to $7 million. This is a decrease in expense of the previous guidance last quarter.","Moving on to non-operating expenses, we recorded a $23 million unrealized gain on our long-term investments in Merus and Agenus during the quarter.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $1.3 billion in cash and marketable securities, and expect to end the year with over a $1.1 billion. The increase in cash and marketable securities compared to the prior quarter is primarily related to the recent public offering of approximately 5 million shares of our common stock resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately $650 million.","On the final slide, you'll see our full-year guidance. Incorporating all the previously discussed changes, we now expect a net loss between $290 million and $300 million for the year. Subtracting the upfront and milestone expenses of approximately $360 million, related to the amended Agenus collaboration, and the Merus, Calithera, and MacroGenics collaborations, our forecast of results for the full-year 2017 would be net income of $60 million to $70 million.","To summarize, we are very pleased with our third quarter performance. We exceeded $1 billion in total revenues years \u2013 total revenue year-to date. Our clinical development programs are advancing as planned. We continue to add to our development pipeline. And we have a strong balance sheet to support our continued growth for the long-term.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open up the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan Chase and Company. Please state your question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the questions and nice quarter. So, I have two for you. I guess, first is probably for Steven and it's on the overall strategy for epacadostat in lung cancer. Now that you've added durvalumab to pembrolizumab and nivolumab in terms of advancing to Phase 3 and each seemed to be going after different segments or combinations in the market and maybe specifically on this front, as it relates to ECHO-306, do you have evidence of additive effects for IDO when added to a PD-1 chemo combo? And then I have one follow-up.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Cory. Hi, it's Steven. Thank you for your question. So, obviously, as you well know and others do, lung cancer incorporates many different settings and different histologies as well. The whole premise behind immunotherapy has always pointed to the fact that the \u2013 that it may \u2013 its maximum benefit may be in areas of low disease burden or even in the adjuvant setting, where you have maybe, potentially, micrometastatic disease to beat.","So, our studies encompass the high-expressing PD-L1 population in combination with pembrolizumab monotherapy which is a care standard there. In the low-expressing settings, the chemotherapy combination with pembrolizumab is felt to be the care standard, despite what happened last week with Merck withdrawing their application in Europe based on KEYNOTE-021G subgroup. We've always felt that the KEYNOTE-189 data was going to be the gating event, that data will report out way before our study finishes. And so, we obviously incorporating a Phase 3 study in combination there, but also exploring a chemotherapy-free option as well. So, there's three arms that particular study.","If you're asking me, do we have efficacy data in combination with chemotherapy that has enabled us, we have ongoing work looking primarily at the safety with chemotherapy combinations. No, and we have not presented efficacy data with that particular combination yet. In the adjuvant or early setting, the Stage III non-small cell lung cancer setting building on specific data, which is post-chemotherapy, radiation combination therapy for patients who are either in a complete remission, partial remission, or stable disease, obviously the durvalumab data in PACIFIC was highly encouraging for a progression-free survival disease free survival benefit.","And this is, again, where immunotherapy, as I said upfront, is felt to potentially work best and that is what we explore in there, the combination versus durvalumab alone. Overarching everything that I'm saying is our tolerability profile. As you know, we presented now on a number of occasions with exposure data that now exceeds a year. We're very comfortable in our tolerability profile. And, again, that should there be the efficacy we want in the adjuvant setting would be a real win to have that sort of tolerability profile. That's our current strategy across lung cancer. We have not yet announced our BMS plans publicly.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then the second question is for probably Herv\u00e9 or maybe Steven as well. Can you just discuss the strategic thinking behind the MacroGenics collaborations with their PD-1 inhibitor. What was the primary driving force behind doing this deal? Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Okay. So, maybe a step back on \u2013 in immuno-oncology, what we have seen over the past few years is really the establishment of single agent PD-1 in multiple indication across multiple tumor types across many different companies, in fact. And that has been very steady, it has been making progress over more or less the past five years. If you remember CTLA-4 was the first mechanism, and then PD-1 more or less took the position of being the single agent leader in multiple indication.","What we believe, and that's shared by many, many people, is that the next wave, the next frontier for everybody is how to establish I-O\/I-O combinations either with or without chemotherapy, by the way. But how do we find good combination that will improve the profile of PD-1 alone? We know, in that field, the only existing combination is CTLA-4 and PD-1 and, obviously, with our epacadostat PD-1, we are also trying to establish that across a number of indications.","So, what we see in front of us is a new effort, a new wave of clinical test that will be trying to establish combinations of PD-1 plus other product. And as you saw on the slide we showed a little bit earlier, we have seven of them already in the clinic. It includes very different hypotheses from the scientific standpoint. So, some of them are large molecule, like GITR and OX40; some of them are smaller \u2013 small molecule like arginase, JAK, PI 3-kinase delta, epacadostat. And what we \u2013 we're looking at is saying as we are embarking into this new wave of studies, what we would like is to be able to do it with our own PD-1. We have ongoing studies with pembrolizumab and nivolumab with all of these products. And with this deal what we will be able to do is initiate in 2018 combination study with each of these seven mechanism; and then, based on what we learned from the biology and the existing data, we'll be able to move this program to the next step of a pivotal study after we have established that. So, what it gives us is flexibility. It gives us speed.","In fact, there is an economic benefit of doing it with your own PD-1 and it could potentially also be beneficial from the \u2013 in fact, it certainly will be beneficial to the top line by adding an additional product to our portfolio. And amortizing the cost of development across two products instead of one. So, that was what was driving us. It's not very different from what we discussed over the past two years. This opportunity came up and we think it's a good product, and we will be able to move quickly to combination trial in 2018.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good. Thank you for taking the questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please state your question.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","I have a couple. I think for either Steve or Reid. So, the first one is on epacadostat, I know small numbers based on your Phase 2, but I want to get your perspective on the opportunity in PD-L1-negative patients or in minimal expressers, especially as you ramp up Phase 3 combo studies outside of melanoma? And then on ruxolitinib in GVHD, I know data coming up next year for REACH1, but maybe what would you point to in this indication as a clinically meaningful result either response rate or duration of response and how's this different between the chronic and the acute setting? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Geoff, it's Steven. Thanks for your question, and Reid may weigh in after I speak. In terms of your question related to epacadostat in our Phase 2 data in both PD-L1-positive patients and PD-L1-negative, and again we need to be careful in general in terms of which tests we're using whether it's Merck or BMS and what cut-offs we're using. So, that's just as a general caveat.","Obviously, to date, we've presented data in both those populations across multiple tumors. We have some intriguing albeit low numbers to date responses in PD-L1 negatives and we have PD-L1 unknown data which may include both. And, so, I think the jury is still out on whether we'll be able to further enhance the effect in low expressers in PD-L1 negatives and get T-cells to do what they need to do there. But that's been tested across the programs including, as you said, in melanoma where there's no selection upfront, there's merely stratification after the fact , and we expect the vast majority of patients in melanoma to be PD-L1 high or positive. In lung cancer, as we've outlined in the things we put out publicly to date, their selection upfront in both those populations and the question being answered at least in the ECHO-306, is also in combination with chemotherapy. But, all we can point to to date is the data we've shown publicly with some intriguing responses in the negatives.","In terms of ruxolitinib in graft-versus-host disease and across the populations, it's a little bit different for acute versus chronic in terms of what's considered clinically meaningful benefit as well as regulatory benefit. But for REACH1, there's an established primary endpoint of a Day 28 response rate, which is defined by internationally-defined bone marrow criteria, which will look at that response data. But it has to be coupled with a durability of response as well. So, in the shorter settings, in the acute setting, you look for example at three-month durability of response data coupled with the primary Day 28 response rates. In the chronic setting, you look a little bit further out upwards of six months, but it \u2013 and it's really the combination of both response, as well as the duration of response for both of those settings. Thank you.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Maybe another one for Steven. It seems like there's increased interest in moving I-O into the adjuvant setting, and I'm wondering if it's too early to talk about epacadostat in such a role and whether you're planning such trials? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Eric, it's Steven. As I said upfront, in the adjuvant setting, what you're doing in those patients, in that population is treating a potential disease that you can't see so, micro metastatic disease, to try and increase cure rates. In those settings, it's where, in general, immunotherapy-based approaches are felt to be potentially most beneficial. So, you've seen now, reported out adjuvant melanoma studies with different checkpoint and checkpoint plus CTLA-4 combinations showing benefit already.","So, the next thing to do is in melanoma, if the ECHO-301 data points to it, is to test epacadostat in combination with checkpoint in adjuvant melanoma. And what you've seen us doing in the lung cancer setting is trying to build on the durvalumab data in a Stage III non-small cell lung cancer setting, which has a much higher risk for relapse. So, many of those patients untreated, unfortunately, will relapse and you saw the very impressive progression-free and disease-free survival data with durvalumab and now looking at the combination with epacadostat to see if we can further enhance that.","And then, I'll end by the comment I made earlier. Tolerability is key in an adjuvant population. These patients are otherwise well, I want to get on with their lives and don't, for the most part, want to suffer, if they can avoid it, any debilitating side effects. So, our tolerability profile here is encouraging. Obviously, it has to be coupled with an efficacy win as well.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my questions. With regard to the pipeline, can you provide us with the clinical rationale here for this JAK1 plus osimertinib combination study? And then, when should we expect the pivotal FIGHT and CITADEL programs to reach out?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","So, it's Steven. I'll start and, again, Reid may add. If you look at EGFR inhibitor therapy in lung cancer in general, and now this \u2013 the newer generation EGFR inhibitors like osimertinib with their enhanced efficacy post upfront EGFR therapy and potentially in an earlier-line setting . One of the potential mechanisms of resistance is upregulation of the JAK-STAT pathway during therapy with those EGFR inhibitors. So, it's looking at the addition of JAK to osimertinib in that setting to see if we can avert the development of resistance and thus improve clinical outcomes namely time-to-event outcomes. I think your second question was related to timelines to pivotal data from the CITADEL and the FIGHT programs, is that correct?","I'll address that and then you can correct me afterward. So, those are underway at the moment. The FIGHT program is our FGFR 1\/2\/3 inhibitor looking at three different settings: metastatic bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, and a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm. All of those entities are driven by genetic mutations involved in the FGFR pathway that are oncogenic and felt to drive those diseases. In the bladder setting, that's FGFR3; in cholangio, it's FGFR1; and in the myeloproliferative neoplasm, it's an 8p11 translocation. Those studies are ongoing. They're enrolling really, really well despite needing genetic selection. We have been really encouraged by the enrollment. And we should be getting data over the ensuing 24 months.","For the CITADEL program, in general, that's our PI 3-kinase delta inhibitor across different non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, diffuse large B-cell, mantle, marginal and follicular lymphomas, that program is looking at trying to avert toxicity by changing dosing schedule over time. And that is also \u2013 will be enrolling patients over the ensuing 24 months. So, it's a little early to speak about when we'll be seeing pivotal data on those. Thanks.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Congrats for the quarter and thanks for taking my questions. Specifically, I want to ask about the Phase 3 ECHO-301 primary analysis. Is it going to be done in all-comers or on PD-L1-positive melanoma patients only? And then, maybe another one for Steve, have you guys enrolled any patients with Stage III non-small cell lung cancer in the ECHO-203 trial in combination with durvalumab? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Ying, hi, it's Steven. The Phase 3 ECHO-301 melanoma study is in all-comers. There is stratification for PD-L1 status. So, PD-L1 positive and negative is captured upfront and they'll be balance between the treatment arms for each of those groups. So, both the standard of care arm of pembrolizumab and the experimental arm of pembrolizumab plus epacadostat will have the same representation proportionally of PD-L1 positives and negatives. So, again, just to be clear, it's a stratification factor, but the primary analysis is in everybody. In terms of Stage III non-small cell lung cancer patients in the program to date, no we have not enrolled those sorts of patients because of their potential curative nature to date. So, our program is focused to date on latter-stage patients.","Thanks.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the quarter and the continued progress with the pipeline. Couple of questions on the epacadostat pembrolizumab lung cancer Phase 3 designs. I guess, I'm just wondering if you could talk about any potential dose ranging you might need to do for the chemo study for the epacadostat PD-1 chemo arm? Whether you're looking for superiority or non-inferiority for the chemo-free checkpoint IDO arm versus the checkpoint chemo arm, which epacadostat arm would need to hit to constitute success of that study? And then if you might be able to give us any sense of timelines for a potential interim or full data from that \u2013 those recently announced non-small cell lung cancer programs? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","So, Brian, hi. It's Steven. I'll try and answer all four of your questions. So, the enabling safety work for the chemotherapy combinations has been going on in the background for months now. The intent is not to have to change dosing at all and use our Phase 3 doses they've been using across the program, and the ones we have announced to date, all at 100 milligrams BID. So, as long as long as safety stands up to what it's been to date, that's the dose we'll be using in the announced programs for which we have greater than 80% to 90% inhibition of the enzyme, which we've shown in our Phase 1 data.","Your question two, all the analyses are superiority in the announced programs to date. They \u2013 all the comparisons of superiority comparisons, there is no non-inferiority comparison in anything we've announced to date.","In terms of success, the studies are all undertaken with equipoise upfront looking at a standard of care, and then compare it to either one or in the other announced study ECHO-306, two different comparator arms, both looking at superiority. Success will be hitting the endpoints in terms of efficacy that is clinically meaningful and statistically significant for any of those arms, either the chemo-containing or the chemo-free one.","And I think in terms of timelines down the pike, it's really too early given that the studies haven't initiated the ends on the publicly announced ones, in terms of the enrollment numbers, are there for you on ct.gov. And we hope we have the success we had with the melanoma study already in terms of enrollment. And then, it'll be term \u2013 it will be waiting for the endpoints and then so you can do your own calculations there in terms of where \u2013 when we may see it. And I think those were all four of your questions.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Indeed. Thanks, Steven.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Congrats on the quarter as well. One, just around \u2013 just trends you're seeing now that the NCCN guidelines have changed for PV, and just kind of wanted to see kind of how \u2013 do you feel like you're kind of in the midpoint of the education process or is there still sufficiently more wood to chop. And the last one is just philosophically on CTLA-4. Do you think there's a need for better CTLA-4s or is that something you're interested in maybe at your I-O combinations? Thanks.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Okay, Alethia. This is Barry. I'll take the first part of your question about the NCCN guidelines and PV. We continue to grow very nicely in PV, the NCCN guidelines obviously help. As we've said before, that PV total patients continues to grow faster than MF total patient growth, but both MF and PV total patients continue to grow. The education process continues for PV, but we think it's going very well, and we continue to penetrate the available patient population.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Alethia. This is Reid. I'll take your question on CTLA-4. I think, obviously, it was the first-in-class mechanism, really, that established immunotherapy and serves as the foundation for the wave that we're in right now. And it's fundamentally limited by its systemic tolerability profile. But, clearly, it's an efficacious agent and when added to backbone checkpoint inhibitor therapy like PD-1 axis blockade can be highly active and, unfortunately, also highly toxic, at least for some patients with irreversible inflammatory conditions.","So, it's important, I think, for the field that we try to learn from that experience with CTLA-4 and that can come from a few different directions. One is understanding the importance of selecting targets that have a mechanism of action that's constrained to the tumor microenvironment and not necessarily systematically acting drugs and I think we've seen now a wave of new mechanisms coming into the clinic which are designed to do just that. Certainly, epacadostat and IDO1 inhibition is one of those mechanisms, but there's many others in our pipeline and in others.","I think there's another question as to whether or not we can be better at constraining CTLA-4 activity to the tumor microenvironment through other approaches. Bristol is taking a few different approaches such as enhancing effect or function of the antibody, trying to mask activity and release it only in the tumor microenvironment through another technology from CytomX. There maybe bispecific approaches to CTLA-4 that could be interesting as well.","There's still a lot we don't know about the basics of why CTLA-4 is active in one cell type it's active in and why it's systemic toxicities are the way they are. But I think a lot of these approaches are going to design to determine whether there could be a better CTLA-4 antibody and one that is \u2013 still contains its tumor-directed efficacy but avoids the systemic toxicity. So, it's a work in progress, but it's absolutely an important one for the field to continue to study.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Two questions. First on just the MacroGenics PD-1. I'm just trying to understand what the larger goal is. Just given the ongoing studies with PD-1s whether it's pembrolizumab, Opdivo, or now with durvalumab with epacadostat, your goal is obviously to establish a new standard of care, which would also make it more challenging for you to be able to succeed in those settings with the MacroGenics PD-1. And, I guess, what I'm trying to understand is the goal of the MacroGenics deal to establish simply new triplets, is that where we should be \u2013 how we should be thinking about the future development? And then I had a question on Jakafi.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Okay. Let me try to answer the question about PD-1. Epacadostat is not the key driver of the PD-1 agreement. I know it sounds a little bizarre because obviously epacadostat will be a potential beneficiary of this \u2013 having our own PD-1 in the long run. But the way we were thinking was more of the other six products we have currently in Phase 1 combination trial with pembrolizumab and nivolumab, and how to make that clinical development faster, economically easier and potentially giving us the economic benefit of having our own PD-1.","So, that was really the key driver was not to have some sort of short-term epacadostat impact, but to have an impact on the other six products. We are now moving through the process. And that could be done by studying the safety studies in 2018, and then where we feel we have information to move forward, where we'll be able then to get each of these projects moving forward.","Concerning epacadostat obviously someday there could be a benefit of having our own PD-1. There are two scenario, one of them is that pembrolizumab and nivolumab and durvalumab plus epacadostat are established standard of care in multiple indications, so that would be one. Well the question is, can we do it with our own PD-1 also? But there is something that's probably has a far higher probability of success is that we would be also moving through triplets as you were describing, where as we are identifying other combinations that include epacadostat and potentially some of our other product, we will be able to do it with our own PD-1.","So, there is a strategic aspect, there is a tactical clinical development aspect and there is a commercial aspect, and that's why I think it's very important for us to have this product in our own portfolio.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thanks Herv\u00e9. That's very helpful. And the other question I had on Jakafi and maybe one I've asked before. Can you just speak to the line extension, the investor base \u2013 investors generally are obviously focused \u2013 more focused on companies' lead assets and the sustainability of that revenue stream. We appreciate obviously lack of near-term competition or any sort of visible competition. But just if you could speak to how you can maintain this revenue stream, what line extension opportunities you're working on, and is there any timeline that you can show?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Ian, it's Barry. So I'll just try to expand. So I think we've said before \u2013 we certainly said before that we'll exceed $2 billion in total revenue for Jakafi, mostly just with MF and PV and adding in GVHD. When we talk about GVHD as a line extension, we are really talking about acute and chronic GVHD together, right. And then obviously we have essential thrombocythemia. But what we really think the drivers continue to be myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera patients and then add-ons are acute and chronic GVHD and essential thrombocythemia.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Well, Barry, I just...","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","And then on the...","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","How do you replace Jakafi, when (48:41)?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. So let me and maybe you can \u2013 Reid can help on the mechanism, but we have like basically two phases of development where we are trying to improve over Jakafi for both MF and PV and maybe potentially some of the other indication. One of them is working on the \u2013 on combination of mechanism and this is already in the clinic, where we are testing combination with delta, we are testing some alternative schedule of tracks and all of that is already ongoing.","On top of that, we are also looking at new mechanisms that could be helping patients with MF and PV. And maybe Reid can speak about some of these collaborations.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Ian, this is Reid. I think it's an important area for us to continue to innovate in. We're very proud with the efforts that we've done in the MPN space. And I think have brought a very important therapy now to patients. But there still are patients that unfortunately don't receive an optimized benefit from the available therapies and there're still other aspects of benefit that we may be able to achieve with new approaches, new combinations, new therapies.","So this is an active subject of research here. Herv\u00e9 mentioned, the doublet studies in myelofibrosis, I'll remind you that really the selection of targets like PIM, delta, BRD and even LSD 1 were in part because of their potential activity downstream of the JAK-STAT pathway. And in fact for every one of those mechanisms I just mentioned, there exists preclinical or translational correlative data that support their potential utility in combination with ruxolitinib. So that will be something that Steven's group will be executing on over the coming months and several years. The delta study is already ongoing.","Beyond that, it's active area of research within Incyte as to how we think differently about myelofibrosis, what do we think about new targets, how do we think about achieving different types of benefit in patients and that's a very early stage research effort. But it's one that's very important for us to maintain if we're going to continue to have a leadership position in MPNs and continue to drive patient benefits forward. So that's a longer term endeavor, but it's absolutely one that we as a company are very committed to.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Katherine Xu with William Blair & Company. Please state your question.","Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Good morning, and congrats on the good quarter as long as you could indulge me with three questions. Number one is on the FLEX issue (51:27). I'm just wondering whether you could give us an overview and then your strategy there and potential scenarios that we could expect?","Number two is on the ECHO-302, ECHO-305 and ECHO-306 studies, I'm just curious about your rationale and basis for designing those studies in terms of powering and others, in particular just based on the evidence that we have so far and then just what gives you the confidence about those designs?","And number three, assuming ECHO-301 is positive and epacadostat and pembrolizumab becomes standard of care, what is the next step that you are thinking about taking to take the front line melanoma cure to the higher level? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","So, let me start with the FLEX, it would be shorter and there, obviously are public documents that are available. We had press coverage which was surprising coming in the last days or last week, we were \u2013 I'm not sure exactly why it came at that point, but we cannot comment further. So, I think the best is to refer to the existing publicly available documents.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","And then Katherine, in terms of your second and third question. Your second one mentions ECHO-302, ECHO-305 and ECHO-306. The renal cell study is looking at a combination of PD-1 plus IDO beating the current care standard of a VEGF inhibitor-based tyrosine kinase inhibitor, it's either Sutent or Votrient. We needed to execute that study briskly because of the evolving care standards there. We have data from our own program in combination with Merck in ECHO-202 that's already been presented that enabled that decision to be made.","In terms of ECHO-305 and ECHO-306, the lung cancer studies, again the enabling data comes from ECHO-202's lung program in general, it's the PD-L1 high. And again looking at the combo versus PD-1 alone in the high expresses and then in the all comers looking at the care standards of triplet-based therapy \u2013 excuse me, PD-1 plus chemotherapy and then comparing the triplet PD-1 plus IDO plus chemo versus PD-1 plus IDO alone, the somewhat controversial area there is the withdrawal in Europe of that application, but that has not impacted our design and their KEYNOTE-189 study will report out before the study finishes. So, we remain confident.","We do not address powering of our program at all or those design characteristics publicly. We view that as proprietary information between us and Merck which we used to design the program, but we don't put that out publicly.","If ECHO-301 is positive in melanoma, that would be the case standard there. As I mentioned earlier, the natural next place to go to, to address your question to enhance cure rates is the adjuvant setting. To look at the combination in an adjuvant population to increase disease free survival and overall survival, and that would be the intent after that study. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with the UBS. Please state your question.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for the question and congrats on the quarter, guys. I guess one for Herv\u00e9 and maybe Steven. On the strategy for OX40, GITR and I guess just the next wave of I-O assets. Is the message really that we should only expect pivotals with your own PD-1, could we still see pivotals with other approved PD-1s? Just want to be \u2013 I guess just a clarifying question there.","And then, also when you just think about the MacroGenics PD-1, any reason to think that you might still move that forward as a mono therapy either for regulatory or strategic purposes as you broaden out the indications you might go after? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yes, maybe I would start on the \u2013 I think obviously as I've said, I mean the goal is to get this combination done with products from our own portfolio. So you should expect if we go in pivotal study with the PD-1 with OX40 or GIRT or any other product in the I-O portfolio to see that include an MGA012 plus that product in the pivotal studies.","Would it be only with our own PD-1? It will depend highly on the indication we would be pursuing, because as I said in some of these indications pembrolizumab, or nivolumab, or durvalumab, or PD-L1 inhibitors could be the standard of care. But obviously at the end of the day, we want that pivotal program to include MGA012 plus GIRT or MGA012 plus OX40 or plus arginase, et cetera, et cetera. So, that would be the way to think about it.","In term of monotherapy, obviously, you know there are indications where there is the option to receive an indication in monotherapy for PD-1. It could be either of the so-called niche approach, which we have heard a lot from many different companies, so that could \u2013 that is an option, so we are looking at that as a possibility. Or it could be frankly in the less niche indication, where we would be trying to establish it as a single-agent across larger indication, we don't know that yet.","So what we are doing in the short-term are two things is the so-called niche approach in \u2013 with a single-agent MGA012, and as I described we would be initiating a number of combination studies in 2018, so that we can be prepared for the next step in combination with our portfolio.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one last question. And our final question comes from Michael Schmidt with Leerink. Please state your question.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, guys. A couple of quick ones. Number one on ECHO-301, what is the number of events needed to trigger un-blinding of the study? And number two, maybe for Reid, can you comment on how important potential differences are among the various IDO inhibitors development in terms of the PK\/PD profile, and whether or how that might translate into differentiated clinical profiles? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Hey, Michael, this is Steven. Just quickly upfront, we do not disclose the event number that would be \u2013 would trigger the ultimate un-blinding, so that's not public information.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, Michael, this is Reid. On the IDO inhibitor question, the key thing for this target as we know is near complete or complete inhibition. We can do that safely with this mechanism and that's going to be the bar by which we judge compounds. And I think if any compound can safely with appropriate drug like properties achieve those levels of inhibition and then that should drive the pharmacology, irrespective of any biochemical nuances. At the end of the day it's about inhibiting the enzyme to a maximum degree. Differentiation between the agents will come from their ability or inability to do that, as well as any other off-target liabilities they may have.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Great.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host Mike Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Diego. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's first quarter earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available on the Investors section at incyte.com.","Speaking on today's call will be Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, our CEO, who will begin with a strategic review and provide further detail on our acquisition of ARIAD European business announced this morning; Barry Flannelly, who leads our U.S. organization, will provide some detail on Jakafi sales during Q1; Steven Stein, Incyte's Chief Medical Officer, will give a brief update on our clinical portfolio; and Dave Gryska, our CFO, will summarize our first quarter financial results, the impact of the ARIAD transaction, as well as our upcoming news flow for 2016.","We'll then open the call up for Q&A, for which we'll be joined by Reid Huber, our Chief Scientific Officer.","We'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2016 guidance, our expectations regarding the planned acquisition of ARIAD European operations, the commercialization of Jakafi, and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-K for the quarter ended \u2013 for the year ended December 31, 2015, and from time to time in our other SEC documents.","I'd now like to pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for some introductory remarks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike, and good morning. So, moving to slide five, let me start with a reminder that Incyte has a very unique profile within the biopharmaceutical industry. As we have a fast-growing top line, we have been cash flow positive for each of the last four quarter, and we have the potential for second \u2013 (02:39) impact on source of revenue should baricitinib be approved in 2017. So, we have a very strong start to 2016.","Financially, Jakafi sales growth continued increasing by 59% year-over-year, and we are raising Jakafi net product revenue guidance for 2016. The big potential of the Jakafi brand may also be increased should we be able to successfully develop Jakafi for GVHD.","The latest output from our discovery and development teams was presented at ACR, positioning Incyte for future success. We now have a portfolio of 14 clinical candidates. We have just dosed the first patient in our LSD1 program, and we expect the clinical trial for our GITR program to begin in the next few weeks.","Our latest stage portfolio is also progressing well, and we expect to launch two pivotal programs in the coming months, ECHO-301, the Phase 3 trial studying epacadostat in combination with Merck's pembrolizumab in first line melanoma patients will begin shortly. And in the second half of 2016, we look forward to initiating a registration program for ruxolitinib for the treatment of GVHD.","So moving to slide six, with this perspective in mind, we were pleased to announce this morning an agreement to acquire ARIAD's European business.","As you know, Incyte has a diversified portfolio of exciting development project which represents one of the largest dermatology oncology pipelines in the industry. We also have a fully-integrated U.S. business that is very successful as evidenced by the continuous strong growth in Jakafi.","Our strategy is to do the same in Europe, and we face the technical choice of whether to build the European business or to buy one as we seek to maximize the chances of launch success of our products in Europe.","Last year, we established our European headquarter in Switzerland, which is now home to a growing European clinical development team. And upon closing of the ARIAD transaction which we expect to occur on June 1, Incyte will immediately have a fully-integrated European operation of 125 FTEs with medical and commercial teams in place across the continent.","The addition of the ARIAD team in Europe will not only accelerate the establishment of Incyte in Europe, it will do so in a manner that is financially efficient because revenue generated by sales of Iclusig will offset our European operating cost.","If other compounds from our portfolio are approved in Europe, the ability to leverage our fully-integrated European operation should allow us to maximize the chances of European launch success narrowing our operations in the U.S.","So, slide seven is summarizing the Iclusig profile. Iclusig is approved in Europe for the treatment of patient with CML and Philadelphia-positive ALL that are resistant or intolerant to dasatinib or nilotinib, Sprycel and Tasigna.","Iclusig is also approved for all patients with 315i mutation, and activity against the 315i mutation is important and is very unique to Iclusig among all these BCR-ABL inhibitors.","Moving to next slide, slide eight. Some of the financial components of the transaction, so upon closing which now is planned at the end of the month, Incyte with pay $140 million cash upfront to ARIAD and will pay additional considerations through tiered double-digit royalty on Incyte sales of Iclusig in Europe. We also expect to make two development cost-sharing payment to ARIAD of $7 million, one in 2016 and one in 2017. Additional potential milestone payment may also become due but only if additional indication for Iclusig are approved in Europe. We forecast that the acquisition of ARIAD's European operation will be earnings accretive to Incyte beginning in 2018.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Barry for an update on our Jakafi franchise.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. We continue to see strong growth in Jakafi sales in the first quarter. Net product revenue for the quarter was $183 million, an increase of 59% over the first of 2015. As a result of this performance and a strong underlying demand for Jakafi, we are increasing our full-year net Jakafi product revenue guidance for 2016 from $800 million to $815 million to a new range of $815 million to $830 million.","Slide 11 shows the sales bridge for Jakafi in Q1 versus Q4 last year. Volume growth in Q1 was robust at 7% over Q4 2015, but this was offset by the typical increase in gross to net in the first quarter of each year. This is mostly driven by the 50% discount we make to the coverage gap also called the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients. As patients move out of the donut hole, the gross to net stabilizes for the remainder of the year. Jakafi's standard of care for the treatment of intermediate and high-risk myelofibrosis patients in the U.S. and the beneficial effect for patients is highlighted by the five-year survival data published at ASH last year from the COMFORT-II pivotal trial. Five-year data from the COMFORT-I trial is going to be presented at ASCO in June.","The launch in PV is going well as evidenced by the strong flow of new patients beginning treatment with Jakafi. The 80-week analysis of the RESPONSE trial recently published in Haematologica demonstrated that patients had durable control of hematocrit and spleen volume, and which is now included in the Jakafi label. As we have said previously, we are confident in reaching our long-term Jakafi sales target of $1.5 billion in MF and PV alone.","Patients who experience graft versus host disease represent a significant unmet medical need in the U.S. And if ruxolitinib is successful developed and approved by the FDA, it can provide us with a new indication for Jakafi and provide yet further growth to the brand.","With that, I'd like to pass the call over to Steven for a brief clinical update.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Barry. As you have already heard, our overall portfolio continues to progress well including the first patient dosed in our LSD1 inhibitor program. In my remarks today, however, I will focus on our two new pivotal programs: ruxolitinib in graft versus host disease, GVHD; and epacadostat in first-line melanoma. There is a clear unmet medical need for patients with graft versus host disease, long-term survival rates in patients with corticosteroid-refractory GVHD of between 5% and 30%.","Our multicenter survey published in Leukemia last year and anchored at the American Society of Hematology showed that treatment with ruxolitinib generated a greater than 80% response in patients with GVHD. And of those responders, relapse rate was less than 10%. We believe these are impressive results, and we look forward to the initiation of our pivotal program of ruxolitinib in GVHD patients later this year.","Slide 15 summarizes some key trials within the epacadostat clinical development in hematology and oncology development program, which continues to progress well\/ The ECHO program: we expect about 600 patients to be enrolled into the Phase 2 expansion cohorts by the end of the year. And we expect data to become available from some of these cohorts in the second half of 2016. ECHO-301, the Phase 3 trial of epacadostat in combination of pembrolizumab for the first-line treatments of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma is expected to begin enrolling in the coming weeks. The clinical trials (11:45) record is now available to view.","The trial will have co-primary endpoints of progression-free survival and overall survival, and is planned to enroll 600 patients, randomize one to one into two cohorts of pembrolizumab plus-minus epacadostat. We anticipate initial data from ECHO-301 in 2018.","I will finish my segment with a portfolio slide, which illustrates Incyte's balanced and diverse portfolio of small and large molecules across various development stages. The quality of our drug discovery work was demonstrated at the AACR meeting last month where Incyte candidates were featured in 10 abstracts in both mono and combination therapy settings.","With that, I'll pass the call to Dave for the financials.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steven. And good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by covering the details of the acquisition of ARIAD's European business, and then turn to Incyte's first quarter performance.","The planned acquisition of ARIAD's European business is an important step in executing our strategy of expanding outside of the U.S. We already have the nucleus of the European organization. And this transaction accelerates a planned European expansion while adding a commercialized product to offset future operating expenses.","We anticipate the transaction closing on June 1, 2016, at which time, we'll begin to record revenue for Iclusig in Europe and recognize expenses related to the European business. To provide financial guidance on the ARIAD European business for the remainder of 2016 post closing, we expect net product revenue for Iclusig to be in the range of $25 million to $30 million. This assumes that the transaction closes on June 1 as planned, and that ARIAD records the outstanding deferred revenue relating to Iclusig sales in France.","We expect 2016 R&D expenses to be in the range of $15 million to $20 million. This includes the first of two $7 million payments to ARIAD, relating to development of Iclusig. The second payment will be in 2017. And lastly, we expect SG&A expenses to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. This guidance includes operating expenses for the operations in Europe and the non-cash purchase accounting expense of approximately $10 million. So, this transaction will be considered the purchase of a business will value the product rights of Iclusig as an asset under balance sheet at June 1, and amortize the product rights over the life of the patent.","For the remainder of 2016, the product rights amortization is estimated to be approximately $10 million, these were recorded as cost of product revenue. Looking further ahead, we will seek to strategically invest in our expanded European organization and expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings on a GAAP basis in 2018.","Now, turning to the first quarter. We continued to deliver strong financial performance while increasing investments in our long-term growth. We recorded $264 million in first quarter revenue, this is comprised of $183 million of Jakafi net product revenue, $22 million in Jakafi royalties from Novartis, and $59 million in contract revenue including two milestones paid by Lilly related to the FDA and EMA submissions seeking approval for baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. Jakafi net product revenue of $183 million represents 59% growth over the same period last year.","Based on Jakafi's performance, we are increasing our full-year Jakafi net revenue guidance to a range of $815 million to $830 million. As with similar oral oncology drugs, our gross net adjustment is higher in the first quarter of the year than the rest of the year, primarily because of our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients. We expect that our gross net adjustments for the full year to be approximately 12%.","Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $6 million, this includes the payment of royalties to Novartis on Jakafi sales. Our R&D expense for the quarter was $157 million, this includes the $35 million milestone to Lilly in payment for the rights to develop ruxolitinib in GVHD and $12 million in non-stock compensation.","Looking at our projected R&D expense for the full year. We are updating our current guidance to a range of $635 million to $660 million, this includes the addition of the ARIAD European business and several changes in the components of R&D expense forecast related to our existing portfolio. Specifically, we have added the $35 million milestone payments to Lilly for the rights to develop ruxolitinib in GVHD to our forecast. This increase is offset by increased projected savings related to discontinuation of ruxolitinib in solid tumors and by the removal from our 2016 forecast of development of baricitinib in diabetic nephropathy.","Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $65 million, this includes $8 million in non-cash stock compensation and an increase in our donations to independent charitable foundations, which are typically higher in the first quarter and lower as the year progresses. As far as our projected SG&A expense for the full year, we are updating our guidance to a range of $285 million to $310 million, this includes the addition of the ARIAD European business previously mentioned.","Turning now to net income and earnings per share for the first quarter. We delivered $24 million in net income or $0.13 per share basic and $0.12 per share diluted. For the full year, and driven primarily by our increased revenue guidance for Jakafi, we expect net income to be in the range of $10 million to $20 million.","Looking at our balance sheet, we have the first quarter with $811 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the first quarter, we experienced strong positive cash flow from operations and milestone payments from Lilly. We expect positive operating cash flow from operations to continue through 2016, but expect to be offset by upfront payment to acquire the ARIAD European business as previously discussed and planned capital spending on our Delaware campus.","We expect to end the year with over $600 million in cash and cash equivalents. With our current cash balance and multiple sources of cash flow, we are in an excellent position to continue to make important investments in our long-term growth.","I'll end our prepared remarks with news flow slide. We have just dosed the first patient in our LSD1 program. In the next several weeks, we expect to initiate a clinical trial for the GITR program and dose the first patient in the pivotal Phase 3 trial of epacadostat in first-line melanoma. Later in 2016, we expect additional proof-of-concept data from the ongoing Phase 1, Phase 2 trials of epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 antibodies to become available as well as initial clinical results from our FGFR and BRD programs. The initiation of the OX40 Agenus clinical trials are slated for the second half of 2016, as is the initiation of the registration program for ruxolitinib in GVHD.","In summary, we are well positioned with a robust and diversified product portfolio. We have the financial resources to enable us to build a global biopharmaceutical company and create long-term shareholder value.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks, please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","At this time, we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Please state your question.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hey guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I guess, my question would be, in terms of timing, what prompted you to seek to expand the European infrastructure at this time versus in a couple of years once some of the Phase 3s for epacadostat and the other programs are a little bit more advanced? And I'm curious if you have any other plans for Iclusig development other than the cost sharing that you suggested. And then, I guess lastly on that front, as we look towards sort of future investment, you mentioned the potential to expand out that infrastructure, what's the right way to be thinking about the potential SG&A impacts going forward? I know ARIAD has mentioned that they plan to save $65 million in expenses next year. Should we be thinking about an additional $65 million sort of an exact offset or other potential synergies or conversely additional investments that you might make that might increase the impact to SG&A beyond that? Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you, Brian. Let me try to take it through your question. I think the timing is a very important question, and thank you for asking that. The way we look at our maturation of the portfolio is obviously the initiation of the Phase 3 study with epacadostat is an important milestone, but we're also looking at the advancement of many of our own projects including our JAK1 selective inhibitor 110 in multiple indication, as you know. We also \u2013 and you saw some of the data at ACR, moving our Phase 3 kinase delta and our EGFR inhibitor is also now reaching in the Phase 1 stage where we are looking at the next step. So, it's not just one, but I think there are a number of ways where we will be in a mode where we need to be more active in Europe to maximize the potential of these launches, any of these make it through the entire process.","So, we are now in mid-2016. We're obviously looking for some of these projects at somewhere around 2019 maybe, and I think it's the right time to be ready not only to prepare the launch, like the commercial aspect, but as you know in \u2013 there is also involvement of European centers, so part of the ARIAD acquisition includes medical teams that I think will be very important to maximize our activities in Europe, and obviously, the market access and all the work that needs to be done to be able to go through the reimbursement process very quickly.","So, the way we think about it is that we are now at this stage where we will have a team in place. And as you have heard, I mean, the way \u2013 and I will answer your question about the SG&A impact, but what we are looking at is that the Iclusig potential, it's a product that is growing relatively fast, will allow us to be in a position where in fact the team is self-funded for this time, we have between now and whenever the next product is coming.","In terms of the plans for new indication for Iclusig, the current situation is obviously we have a best plan based on the current indication. You know there is an effort ongoing, and we would be participating to that of doing two things. One is to try to optimize the dose, and as you know, the dose of Iclusig is something that is still under review and there is a study ongoing to try to see if a different dose would have a better therapeutic window. And there is a study to compare it to nilotinib in second-line CML. So, both of these are ongoing. And obviously, based on the results, we would be including this data in our European label. For other indications, there is no specific plan that we are pursuing at all.","For the $65 million, the way you have to think about it is that we have, in fact in our plans for 2016, expenses that we were anticipating at Incyte to try to stop to have infrastructure in some of the European country to do what I was just describing, which is help the epacadostat delta, JAK1, FGF programs work locally with the three academic centers, et cetera. And all of that costs that we are planning to have starting in 2016 and in 2017 is obviously not going now to be happening in addition to the IR team, in fact the IR group, the medical group will take some of that workload on the \u2013 based on the current infrastructure. So, you have two things happening, it's that you have an offset of cost that would have happened if we had not done the transaction and you have obviously the management of the cost going forward between the Iclusig dedicated team and the teams that would be working on other projects. And as we said, we see this to be completely balanced starting \u2013 or in fact, accretive to our business starting in 2018.","Now, we have no plan in the very short term to expand the infrastructure that we are acquiring from ARIAD, so you should not think of another wave of new SG&A coming from Europe because we think the size is in fact exactly what we are shooting for if we have to do it by ourselves. I think that answered most of the question you were asking, right?","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, Herv\u00e9. That's really helpful. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking my question. So, I just want to follow up on the earlier question regarding the ARIAD transaction. So, we should assume at this point you're comfortable in the size of investment in the European operations? And could you also give us some color on the $135 million in milestones and what the breakdown is and the threshold levels here? And I have a question on the pipeline to follow up with.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, I'll take these two. Starting with the milestones, the way all the milestones that we have are attached to new indications, some of them are related to the second-line potential indication based on the study versus the nilotinib. And some of them are attached to potential indications that could be in oncology or outside of oncology. So, it's a very broad field, obviously we don't know yet if there is there is or will be any effort in any of these indications. So, that's where the \u2013 except for the second-line Tasigna that we discussed. I don't think we will be disclosing exactly the details by indication, so that gives you the perspective, which for us, is basically that we have a base case based on the current indication that works for us, and we see everything else coming in addition to that as a upside from that base case.","In terms of the size of the infrastructure in Europe, which was your first question, we are very comfortable with where it is. It's well spread across a number of countries where we want to be able to actively develop our products, and that will be the core of the launch program for our new products in Europe and it's as usual Italy, Spain, France, Germany and UK. So, it gives us the right footprint that we would have created by ourselves if we didn't do this transaction.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Herv\u00e9. And then, with regards to IDO program that's going to read out in the second half, can you help us understand which tumor types would we read out first? And with the Keytruda plus IDO1 melanoma study, the ECHO-202, the Phase 2 portion of that study, will we see more patient data over the data seen at SITC or is it just going to be more scans? And then, just one question on Jakafi guidance, is the increase really driven here by PV upside or expectations of future MF upside? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Salveen, thanks. It's Steven. So, as you know, we presented at SITC and SMR in the fourth quarter of 2015 on the initial data sets which we now have additional scans in those patients, which has reinforced our confidence in epacadostat-pembrolizumab combination in first-line melanoma and our decision to initiate the Phase 3 program. However, there is not enough new data to justify a presentation at this time. So, I think it's the meat of you question, if you look across the four PD, PD-L1 combinations, as we said on the call, we'll enroll about 600 patients across 13 tumor types, so it's too early to say what tumor types will have available data win, but we will be getting data over the course of the year, and that's is the most I can say about it at this point in time.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","And your question about Jakafi guidance is \u2013 it's driven both by MF and PV. In fact, we continue to add new patients in both PV and MF, and the other part of it is many of these patients are staying on drug for a long period of time. So, that's where our guidance comes from.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Leerink Partners. Please state your question.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Herv\u00e9, I had a follow-up on the ARIAD transaction. Given that there is still some time, as you mentioned, until your in-house sort of products could come online in Europe, how do you think about adding additional commercial or new commercial products to that existing infrastructure via business development?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Thanks, Michael. You're right. I mean it's something we don't sort of predict because, as you know, every BD&L is always an adventure on the anniversary of the result, but it has been the case that when we were looking at opportunities in the past, just having a footprint in the U.S. only was in fact a problem for the partners who were looking for somebody to commercialize their product on a broader basis. So, it was a little bit of a catch-22 where you don't have the team, you don't get the product. And if you don't have the product, you don't have the team. So, what we have now is a very efficient way to have a high-quality group of people, an interesting product that is growing and obviously, it will open new opportunities. And as we have always said, I mean we look at different options and if something seems to make sense from the strategic and financial standpoint, we will do it. But we don't need to do it, I mean, the way we are now deployed in Europe and the U.S., we have teams that obviously in the U.S. generating a lot of income from Jakafi. And in Europe, we'll have a team with a growing top line and interesting product and covering most of the cost from that Iclusig business. If we can have something else, it would be in addition to some upside on that scenario. But the best scenario now is very good and I think will help us maximize our launches when they come.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then, a question on the GVHD opportunity. You had some information there on an incident prevalence, I mean just \u2013 could you share some more information on the size of that opportunity, and especially is that a chronic type of therapy paradigm? Or is it a sort of a one-time treatment? And also what duration of Phase 3 development do you foresee for that product?","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Well, this is Barry. And maybe I'll hand it over to Steven for more information. But in terms of the opportunity, there's 21,000 stem cell transplants in the United States alone, about half of those are autologous, another half are allogeneic. If the allogeneic patients that end up having the GVHD, fewer patients have acute GVHD, and then more patients have chronic GVHD.","And the way it generally breaks down is that then those patients who have acute GVHD might have a shorter duration of therapy and chronic GVHD might have a longer duration of therapy. We think it's an exciting opportunity, and we hope to help a lot more patients with GVHD as we hopefully successfully develop this drug.","And I'll hand it over to Steven to answer the question about Phase 3 development.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Thanks, Barry. And then, just in terms of the question, one of our slides in the presentation alluded to incidents in the U.S. of new patients of 7,000, about half acute, half chronic. And then in terms of prevalence, about 10,000 patients with chronic GVHD. In terms of development plans, obviously as Herv\u00e9 said, we have an ongoing study with our JAK1 inhibitor 39110 which is in Phase 1 safety tolerability at the moment in GVHD. And now with the acquisition of the ruxolitinib rights and already having achieved, if you will, a proof-of-concept with the external data, we're developing registration plans.","The ruxolitinib proof-of-concept data is in steroid refractory, acute on chronic graft versus host disease. So, that's the likely area of development there. And then, we will discuss our own 39110 development plans because there are other entities to consider. There is still first-line acute GVHD, and there's still potential for prophylaxis in this setting. So, those are the areas we're considering at the moment.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Morgan T. Haller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. This is Morgan on for Cory. Actually, a quick question on the further development of Iclusig. How does that kind of fit into what the rest of everything you have going on with the pipeline, just with the bandwidth you have? And then, I've a follow-up.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. It's Steven answering you, Morgan. In terms of Iclusig, as Herv\u00e9 said, there is ongoing work to do in the actual indication within chronic myeloid leukemia. There is a reasonable amount of safety evidence that dose ranging work may alleviate some of the toxicity as regards arterial occlusive disease. So, executing that study will be very important across three dose ranges. And then, there is ongoing effort, as Herv\u00e9 always said as well, in second-line chronic myeloid leukemia head-to-head against nilotinib. In terms of further development, it's a relatively promiscuous agent in terms of different kinases that it does hit, and what's now the setup of a joint development committee with areas, we'll have to discuss those opportunities going forward, whether they're areas of interest to explore or not. But it's really too early to say more about that at the moment.","Morgan T. Haller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","(37:05).","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And maybe just to complement that in terms of how does it fit with the rest of the portfolio, we don't see \u2013 there is no overlap. I mean, these two studies are already ongoing, and it's not going to compete with the rest of the portfolio. It's a project that would be managed in a totally separate manner than the rest.","Morgan T. Haller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. And then, I just want to confirm that the guidance of $25 million to $30 million is for post close, is that correct?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Morgan T. Haller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please state your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, good morning, guys. This is Carter on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our questions. I've got one on strategy. I appreciate the cost efficiency on today's deal and sort of the optionality it gives you in terms of involving EU sites and maximizing the launches. Was there any sense given to how this maybe changes prioritization of certain indications and thinking specifically on IDO?","And then, on the GVHD opportunity, could you speak about the strategy of moving forward to both the 110 and ruxolitinib, given your motivations and \u2013 on the economics and the partnership with Novartis? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe on the first one, no, it has absolutely no impact. I'm sorry, I was \u2013 it has absolutely no impact on rethinking the IDO indication between hematology and oncology. I mean these are completely separate. I think there is \u2013 obviously, a lot of our pipeline that is in hematology, there are a number of solid tumor indication where we are looking at it. And Iclusig is not changing any of the balance between oncology and hematology in our pipeline. And maybe, yeah, if you can speak about the GVHD development.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure. It's Steven again. Thanks, Herv\u00e9. So, just to reiterate and maybe go a bit slower, in terms of graft versus host disease, there are at least four entities. There is steroid refractories. Steroids, particularly prednisone, is first-line treatment. But if you get steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease and after about 100 days of this devastating medical condition, you can get what's called chronic graft versus host disease which is also steroid refractory. So, those are two separate entities.","And then, there is also first-line acute graft versus host disease when patients are treated for the first time before they become refractory to steroids. And then, there is a fourth potential entity where you can actually think about prophylaxing for the condition in people post allogeneic bone marrow transplant who had high risk to develop graft versus host disease.","So, all four of those are being considered. What I said in my earlier comments with ruxolitinib that the data published last year in Leukemia and presented at ASH, they have presented, if you will, proof-of-concept data for ruxolitinib in both of the first two entities, steroid-refractory acute and steroid-refractory chronic graft versus host disease. So, those are the likely areas of the development for ruxolitinib. And then for 39110, we would be considering the other entities. And that's where we are at the moment. And I hope that answers your question.","Unknown Speaker","Just a quick follow-up. Does the Novartis deal preclude from moving forward with 110 in those earlier settings? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, it does not.","Unknown Speaker","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.","Ying Huang - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one for housekeeping question. Does your Jakafi revised guidance for 2016 include any pricing increase for the rest of the year? And then secondly, how important is the second-line CML indication for Iclusig in Europe for you in terms of decision making in license their rights? Thanks.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","So, it's Barry. Obviously, we took price increase on April 1, and we don't really discuss our pricing strategy going forward after that.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, let me take that one on the second-line indication. The way our deal is constructed in fact makes it such that it works with and without the second-line indication. It works differently with the current indications that we have. And Iclusig is growing relatively fast in Europe, it's still in the launch \u2013 prelaunch mode in many of the countries as it is being reimbursed. And assuming there is no second-line indication, it will give us enough resources to cover the costs of the infrastructure.","If we get the second-line indication, it's going to trigger our milestone payments as we have discussed and it's going to obviously increase the potential top line and it would be an upside to the base case, but both base case and the upsize case reaching our strategic objective which is to get the team in Europe to be self-funded in some way.","Ying Huang - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks, Herv\u00e9. And then, if I may just squeeze in one follow-up on the data release. So, it doesn't sound like you guys have any significant update at ASCO, should we assume the next meaningful update for epacadostat at ESMO?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, it's Steven. So, you're right in that we are leading to the second half and we can't comment on what will be at ESMO until the abstracts are released, but that is the second half of the year is where we're targeting presenting more data.","Ying Huang - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thank you for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Unknown Speaker","Hi, this is Nathan for Ian. Thanks for taking the question. So, starting off with the ARIAD deal, how should we think about the buyback contingency plan within the deal? And then, could you comment on any tax implications of the deal and whether you may be able to see any tax advantages from an EU operations perspective? And then, I have a question on the pipeline.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thank you. I'll take the buyback. I mean obviously, you can \u2013 you'll realize, and I think it's very rational that it was very important to ARIAD because in their overall strategic approach to the company which is basically we group resources in the U.S. territory. It makes sense to have this transaction about the European business done because it will reduce their spending and it just happened and it's also a very good deal from our side for all the reasons that we have discussed.","So, I think it's a case of complementarity. And then, came this issue of what if somebody is willing to acquire ARIAD, so it's based on the charge of control of ARIAD, and is interested in the European business. So, we came up with this buyback option that is part of our agreement and the buyback option is obviously responding to their needs and is built in such a way where there is timing, so it can happen basically between three year and six year of that (44:45) signature of the deal.","So, it gives us a certain amount of time to get prepare for that in case it were to happen, and it's based on financial terms that have been discussed, where there would be all the milestones that have been paid plus additional milestone based on the past 12 months of sales plus forward royalties of 20% to 25%. So, in some way, it was sort of meeting everybody's needs where there is a delay of a number of years, it's still allowing a potential buyer of ARIAD to have access to Iclusig, and it's giving us financial condition that would be certainly somewhat favorable. So, that's how it was built, and I think it's meeting everybody's needs in this transaction.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","On your second question, it's Dave, on the tax, there will be some tax efficiency because ARIAD does have some net operating losses that we will carry forward to us on the acquisition of the entity. And to the extent that the profits that this enterprise creates in the future are enough to offset the NOLs, we do have some NOLs in our entity that we started in Switzerland, so there is some tax efficiency that will be \u2013 that will benefit from by this acquisition.","Unknown Speaker","Great. And then, on the pipeline, can you help us understand, how your early-stage oncology portfolio fits together and how you plan to develop these drugs, and what data you have generated so far that could help direct development of combinations within the pipeline? Thank you.","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Hi. This is Reid. Thanks for the question. So, as we've brought forward discovery programs and now into early development programs over the last four years to five years, there has been a concerted effort by the team to build and nucleate around certain aspects of the portfolio. One of those is really around JAK inhibition where we've had, I think, a long-standing leadership position beginning with ruxolitinib and baricitinib in JAK1 and JAK2 inhibition, but now more recently into more evolved profiles like JAK1 selective inhibition. Those agents with, I think, clear opportunity in hematologic malignancies offer us the opportunity to build around them and bring forward other agents which are very interesting in their own right and have their own potential development programs, but also leverage the JAK inhibitor space. And one example of that is PI3K\u03b4, and we've presented over the years a lot of the pre-clinical data and even some clinical data last year at ASCO that helps to reinforce the interest in that particular doublet, and that will be one that we continue to explore in the clinical setting.","Beyond just JAK1 and delta, it's also given us the opportunity to bring forward mechanisms like PIM inhibition which really works as it correlate to delta inhibition, they are active on the exact same pathway and are sort of reciprocally regulated. And so, a PIM inhibitor in our portfolio makes a lot of sense and would allow us to do interesting things in the combinations base, again much of which we've presented over the years publicly.","And finally, LSD1 and BRD, two epigenetic mechanisms both with a potentially important role in leukemias and potentially also in lymphoma for BRD again just build around that portfolio philosophy quite well. And the exact same thing is happening on the immuno-oncology side. Again, they are nucleated around IDO inhibition where we now have brought forward our first GITR agonist, soon an OX40 agonist and also in licensed a PD-1 inhibitor, and from a small molecule side began to explore some very novel biology around JAK and PI3-kinase delta inhibition on modulating the local inflammatory environment to provoke immune cell function.","So, I think that you can look at our portfolio and hopefully see that around targeted therapies and immunotherapies, there is actually a very strong effort to bring forward mechanisms, which not only have their own potential monotherapy approaches, but also very much leveraged the adjacent molecules in our portfolio. And the idea frankly is to create a portfolio where the value and the totality is much greater than the simple some of the parts.","Unknown Speaker","Great. Thanks for the color and congrats on the deal.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please state your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick clarification question for Barry on the volume growth of Jakafi in the quarter. I think the slide says 13% growth. You autobold in your scripts 7% quarter-on-quarter growth, was there also some inventory stocking going on?","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","No, the slides are referring to millions of dollars, so it's $13 million one way, $12 million the other way.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","(49:56) Thank you. And...","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","So, a 7% demand growth, I should say, as I said in the script.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, maybe for Steven, as you think about making a go, no-go decision and something like lung cancer for epacadostat, I think you've committed doing that before year end. Do you need to see the data from the ongoing PD-1 studies and first-line lung cancer given maybe dynamic nature of that tumor type?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Eric, Yeah, it's Steven. Thanks for your questions. So, again, 600 patients, 13 histologies, we'll have data availability across the second half of this year, and lung is one of those histologies where we will be looking closely and making decisions based on data. I \u2013 in terms of your question where we need to see first-line data to make decisions, to be honest here, it would be helpful. But I don't think we have enough historical controls and enough date already across many, many agents that I think we have to be able to make rational comparisons using things like response rate, so it's not an absolute.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please state your question.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi there. Just strategically, I was wondering if you could kind of compare contrast the idea of acquiring ARIAD versus perhaps doing an acquisition like this, and might this be part of a longer-term strategy with respect to acquiring ARIAD? And any tax implications too would be helpful. Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I think, I mean you have to do \u2013 to put it from our needs standpoint. I mean we have already a very large portfolio of projects in our pipeline. I think we have a strong discovery team for small molecule. It has been very productive over a number of years. So, our discussions were very much about what we need and we don't have, which is an organized European platform with infrastructure with medical team across the different countries, commercial team, and market access.","I think it just happened that it was strategically something that ARIAD was interested in discussing for the reason I was explaining. And I think for the reason they have also communicated this morning that they are trying to concentrate their resources into U.S. to be ready to not only grow Iclusig, but also some of the pipeline products that may be coming soon. And that's where the discussion was centered, in fact. So, I see it as a deal that has a lot of win-win qualities for both organization and where we get really what we were looking for, which is related to our European infrastructure and being able to maximize our products there.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay, thank you. That's helpful. And then, just a technical question, you mentioned amortizing the product rights for Iclusig, what period of time should we think about that over?","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That will be over \u2013 it's Dave speaking. Liisa, it will be over the life of the patent, and it will straight line.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","And when do the patents end, can you remind us your assumptions are there?","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","The patents end in 2026.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, if you could just comment at all on \u2013 I know Concert put forward this oral JAK molecule that's (53:45) for alopecia, can you comment on any IP and kind of plus minus benefits on topical versus oral for that alopecia indication? And that's my final question. Thank you.","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Sure, Liisa. This is Reid. Just \u2013 so on the IP side, so our patent applications for ruxolitinib do disclose an embodiment that includes all isotypes \u2013 isotopes of atoms occurring in the compounds for the invention, and that specifically includes isotypes (sic) (isotopes) (54:18) of hydrogen such as tritium and deuterium. So, we're very confident in the patent, at this state, we have around ruxolitinib. And we'll clearly look to protect that if it makes sense.","In terms of the oral versus topical, we're doing a study right now with topical ruxolitinib, so we'll answer that question clinically in terms of how that formulation looks in that method of delivery relative to oral therapy. Obviously, on any oral therapy particularly in a condition like this one has to be particularly cautious around safety implications in this sort of a disease, and that's really what drove our interest in the topical formulation. And there's a considerable proportion of the patient population where a topical formulation could address the significant unmet need. Obviously, an oral therapy could be more appropriate for much more widespread disease and maybe effective there but it has to be balanced with the safety risk that come from oral JAK inhibition in those types of patients.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ren Benjamin with Raymond James. Please state your question.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good afternoon \u2013 good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess just one for me regarding the ECHO-301 study. Can you just talk a little bit about obviously the co-primary endpoints. Do both need to hit for an application or is there a potential strategy for \u2013 if you get the PFS first and application going in and waiting for the OS, or how are you thinking about it?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Ren, it's Steven. The ECHO-301, as you \u2013 the Phase 3 in first-line melanoma does have co-primary end points of progression-free survival and overall survival, and it doesn't have to be both. We could fall with a benefit in either. So, that's why we estimate data availability in 2018, and obviously that's based on the PFS endpoint.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And then, maybe just going back to the ARIAD deal real quick, how many countries is Iclusig approved in, and as part of the strategy to either expand further in terms of building sales forces in individual countries?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, I can speak with the territories that we have organized this transaction around. So, it's approved at the European Union level, so that's where the technical approval is taking place. And then, there is a reimbursement that is done country by country. So, in term of the European Union, the reimbursement is obtained now in some of the large counties like Germany, but it still work \u2013 and Italy, which is obviously a very fast-growing country for Iclusig. But it's still not fully obtained, as you know, in France, there is a situation where you can have an ETU, you can basically sell the product before it is fully reimbursed but there is a clawback that is taking place at the time of reimbursement, and it's anticipating \u2013 anticipated to be happening relatively soon. And some of the other countries are still in the process of getting reimbursement, inside the EU. And then, in our agreement, there are countries outside of the European Union, like Russia is one of them, where we will have to find a partner which is probably what we will be doing to go through the entire process of approval and reimbursement.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Berens with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question.","Andrew Scott Berens - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Two questions, one on epacadostat and then one on Iclusig. As we prepare for the PFS data in melanoma later this year, I guess the first quarter of next year, how should we think about the benchmark commercially for the combination therapy, not just versus Keytruda but also maybe some of the other data that are out there for combination IO therapy?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Hi, Andrew. It's Steven. So, just to be clear, so we \u2013 the ECHO-301 PFS data will be most likely 2018. Later this year, as I said earlier, we hope to be able to update our Phase 1 data that we presented at SITC and SMR last year. We'll have enough additional scan data to update that. In terms of the benchmarks, obviously, there is regulatory and then there is the clinical benchmark and you alluded to the latter. From a regulatory point of view, we will have to beat the labeled pembrolizumab monotherapy PFS of around six months, but the de novo of AP (59:23) clinical benchmark in the same setting is around 11.5 months, So, those are the sort of numbers we're thinking off. And then, there is a bunch of new answers around PD-L1 positivity, et cetera, which can come in. You just have to be really careful that you compare in an apple-to-apple in terms of the data sets and the staining that you're using. But we think about it mostly in terms of those two numbers I just alluded to.","Andrew Scott Berens - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And we're not going to get any of the PFS data from the Phase 1, Phase 2 trial? I had thought that we are expecting at the end of this year maybe.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","No. You are correct. We will have updates on the scans available to us in appreciable amounts sometime in the second half of this year and we hope to be able to present it to you, that is our intent.","Andrew Scott Berens - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. So, we will see PFS from that trial?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes.","Andrew Scott Berens - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Great. And then in terms of Iclusig, guys, those of us who don't cover ARIAD, think about modeling the EU opportunity, have they experienced any reference pricing in Germany yet and what's the status in UK with these assessment?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","So, maybe I can take some of that. So, in Germany, the price went through the entire review and is a price study approved by the government. In the UK, most of the usage is funded through the cancer fund. So, it's not a nice reviewed kind of situation, it's a cancer fund. Remember, it's a relatively rare form of CML because the product is approved for two groups of patients, the one who are resistant or refractory or intolerant to nilotinib or Sprycel, and a group of patients with 315i mutation. And the 315i mutation is relatively rare in the first-line setting, but the incidents of 315i mutation is increasing with the lines of treatments that you are receiving. So, it becomes more and more frequent on the smaller number of patients, as patients are going from first-line to second-line to third-line.","So, in the UK, it's going through the cancer fund. In Germany, it went through the entire process. It's ongoing in France. And we are anticipating \u2013 or ARIAD is anticipating the resolution of the negotiation in France. It's already approved and reimbursed in Italy, and the other countries are still in the reimbursement process now.","Andrew Scott Berens - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the color. I appreciate it.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we are out of time for questions. I will now turn the conference back over to Mr. Hoppenot for closing remarks. Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay, Yes, thank you. Thank you all for your time today and for your questions. I think it's a day today where we're sure that we have made three bigger steps for a while. I mean, one is obviously the growth of Jakafi in the U.S. because it's important to see that now we are a year after the launch in PV, and we are still growing very dynamically with both in PV and in MF. I mean, we spoke about second big step which is a progress of our pipeline, we are planning to initiate two pivotal study soon or over the next few months with epacadostat in first-line melanoma and with ruxolitinib in GVHD, and I think it's really important.","And as you see, the third big step was now establishing Incyte firmly as a transaction-fee company with an organization in Europe. And as I said at the beginning, our goal with that organization is really to narrow the powerful and successful organization that we have in the U.S. with established now five years or six years ago, and be able to make sure that we maximize our launches when our products are maturing, and also grow Iclusig that has a lot of potential to grow as it's still in a phase of the launch that is relatively early.","So, I think, it was a very exciting few weeks and months for us in the beginning of the year, and I'm looking forward to sharing our progress with you later this year or with Q2 call by midyear.

A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Mike Booth, VP of Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Diego. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's second quarter 2017 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com. And I'm pleased \u2013 and I'm joined on the call today by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Steven, Dave, and Reid. We'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2017 guidance, the commercialization of our products, and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline, as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners.","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2017 and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents.","I'd now like to pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for his introductory remarks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate you all taking the time to participate in the call today and we are very excited to share with you the significant progress we have made during the second quarter. First, Jakafi continues to show strong sales growth of 33% in its sixth year on the market as the number of patients benefiting from this treatment continues to increase.","Importantly, total revenue in Q2 also grew by 33% year-over-year as strong royalties from Jakafi, sales from Iclusig, and the first full quarter of royalties from Olumiant resulted in a total revenue of $326 million for the quarter. Speaking of Olumiant, it's now approved in Europe, in Switzerland and Japan, and let me quickly address the updates that we along with Lilly provided last week.","Based on feedback from the FDA to its Complete Response letter for the NDA for baricitinib, we announced that an NDA re-submission would be delayed for period anticipated to be a minimum of 18 months. We and Lilly are now evaluating options for re-submission after the FDA indicated that a new clinical study is necessary to further characterize the benefit risk across doses. We continue to disagree with the FDA's conclusion and we believe that the existing clinical data demonstrate a positive benefit risk profile that supports baricitinib's approval as a new treatment option for people suffering from RA in the United States.","Moving now to our in-house portfolio. Incyte now has five products in late-stage development, which could provide us with significant commercial opportunities, pending successful development and regulatory approvals in the 2019 to 2021 time period. These programs are ruxolitinib, itacitinib, epacadostat, our PI 3-kinase delta, and our EGFR inhibitor.","I'll now briefly touch on several important advancements we have made here over the last few months. Most importantly, we have initiated two pivotal trials, REACH3, the pivotal trial of ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory chronic GVHD, which enrolled its first patient in June; and GRAVITAS-301, the pivotal trial of itacitinib in patients with treatment-na\u00efve acute GVHD, which began in July. This results in a total of four ongoing pivotal trials in patients with various forms of GVHD.","We have also been working diligently with both Merck and BMS, and I can confirm that plans for the expanded ECHO Phase 3 program for epacadostat are on track for initiation later this year. Steven would provide you with some additional color in the clinical section.","Our discovery and early development efforts continue rapidly, and I'm very pleased to say that INCB62079, our selective FGFR4 inhibitor, entered the clinic in June. This initial trial will be a dose escalation study in patients with liver cancer and other advanced malignances.","In summary, we have made significant progress in the first-half of 2017. Jakafi and Iclusig sales are robust. We are executing on our clinical objectives. Our global operations are progressing as planned, with manufacturing and market access for us (05:05) expanding in Europe and the establishment of initial clinical operations in Japan. Incyte (05:11) on the belief that investments in innovation creates value. This belief has served us well to-date and we look forward to keeping you updated as our company continues to grow.","With that, I'll pass the call to Barry for an update on Jakafi.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. Jakafi sales in Q2 were strong at $276 million, a 33% increase over Q2 of 2016 and a 10% increase over the first quarter of this year. Demand growth was up Q2 versus Q1 by over 7%. We believe this momentum is due to both the quality of the data underlying Jakafi and to the efforts of our U.S. team here at Incyte. Jakafi's performance in the quarter was driven by strong patient demand for both indications, while total PV patient growth continues to outpace the MF patient growth.","We believe that a key driver of demand in MF is the impact of the NCCN guidelines that were published last year, which first included Jakafi as a recommended treatment for MF. Updated NCCN guidelines for MPNs were published late last week and for the first time these guidelines now cover polycythemia vera. Jakafi was included as a recommended treatment for patients with PV, who had inadequate response to first-line therapies, such as hydroxyurea. We are very pleased that the NCCN guidelines for MPNs now include Jakafi for both myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera.","A quick word on inventory, which has been fairly steady within a range of 2.5 to 3 weeks. Last quarter, we stated that we exited Q1 at the high-end of a normal range for inventory. This has now been normalized in the second quarter. Lastly, as a result of our strong sales growth, we are pleased to raise our full-year 2017 net product revenue guidance for Jakafi from a range of $1.020 billion to $1.070 billion to a new range of $1.090 billion to $1.120 billion.","Jakafi commercial momentum is clearly very strong, and now I'd like to share a slide on how we plan to further grow the brand. We have pivotal programs, which are designed to evaluate ruxolitinib in patients with graft-versus-host disease and in patients with essential thrombocythemia, where there is both a need for new treatments and where the rationale for JAK inhibition is strong.","As of late June, all three trials in the REACH pivotal program of ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory GVHD have been initiated. This broad program encompasses patients with both acute and chronic GVHD, and we expect to enroll a total of 600 patients into the REACH trials. Should the REACH1 trial have a positive outcome, we would expect to file an sNDA seeking accelerated approval of ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD during 2018.","RESET-272, the pivotal trial of ruxolitinib in patients with essential thrombocythemia, is now open for enrollment and we expect to dose the first patient in the coming weeks. ET is characterized by the overproduction of platelets in the bone marrow, which can lead to unnecessary clotting and cause heart attacks or strokes. The trial is being run head-to-head ruxolitinib versus anagrelide, and we expect to enroll 120 patients who have failed or are intolerant of hydroxyurea. We are proud of the clinical benefits that Jakafi provides patients with MF and PV, and we look forward to investing further in the clinical development of Jakafi.","With that, I'll pass the call along to Steven for clinical update.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. We've made significant progress in the clinic since we updated you on our first quarter call in May of this year. Shown here on slide 10 are our five key programs in development, within which we have initiated multiple trials in the last few months. In addition to Barry's comments on ruxolitinib's comprehensive clinical development program in graft versus host disease and essential thrombocythemia, you can see that we have now initiated the pivotal program for itacitinib in patients with treatment-na\u00efve acute graft versus host disease.","In the coming months, we expect to initiate multiple trials with our PI 3-kinase delta inhibitor, INCB50465. Following positive proof-of-concept data presented at both ASH last year and ASCO this year, we intend to study this compound in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma.","Let me provide a little extra color on our expanding ECHO development program for epacadostat. As a reminder, we are planning to initiate six Phase 3 trials of epacadostat in combination with pembro in four different tumor types. And we are also planning to launch Phase 3 trials of epacadostat in combination with nivo in two tumor types.","On the epacadostat studies in combination with pembro, I am pleased to confirm that, together with Merck, we have obtained all the necessary regulatory feedback and it remains our aim to open and achieve first patient initiated in all six studies before the end of this calendar year. With Bristol-Myers Squibb, we are in earlier stage in our planning, but are still targeting the planned initiation of these studies before the end of this calendar year.","As we get a little closer to sites initiations and first patient initiated, all of these designs will populate to CT.gov. But you can appreciate that for a variety of competitive and other reasons, we'll not be talking about the designs in any detail before that time.","Moving now to ECHO-301, the ongoing Phase 3 trial of epacadostat in combination with pembro in patients with advanced or unresectable melanoma. The trial is ongoing and, as we've disclosed on the Q1 call, has completed recruitment outside of Japan. The endpoints for ECHO-301 are event-driven and we expect to be in a position to share those data with you in the first half of 2018.","I am also very pleased to announce that epacadostat, and specifically the ECHO-301 trial, has been granted fast-track designation by the FDA. This provision is intended to facilitate development and expedite review of drugs to treat serious and life-threatening conditions, so that an approved product can potentially reach the market rapidly.","In the near-term, we look forward to providing you with an update to the melanoma patient cohort of the ECHO-202 Phase 1\/2 trial at ESMO in September of this year in Madrid. We expect this update to include both the dose escalation patients, which were last presented at ESMO 2016, as well as new data from the Phase 2 expansion cohorts of melanoma patients from ECHO-202 for the very first time.","I'll now discuss some highlights from our upcoming news flow. As I just mentioned, we look forward to sharing updated ECHO-202 data in melanoma patients at ESMO in September. We also expect to dose the first patient in the RESET-272 pivotal trial of ruxolitinib in essential thrombocythemia in the next few weeks. Towards the back-end of 2017, we expect the presentation of dose escalation data for both BRD inhibitors, INCB54329 and INCB57643, as well as dose escalation data for our PIM inhibitor, INCB53914.","Heading into 2018, we look forward to a number of trial outcomes, including two pivotal studies. We expect to be able to share data from the Phase 3 results of ECHO-301, as well as the pivotal REACH1 study of ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease. Lastly, we also expect the first presentation of data from our Phase 2 paired biopsy trials. We are encouraged by the significant progress we've made so far this year, and the next 12 months promises to be a very exciting time for Incyte. If we achieve the goals that we have outlined, we expect to be running up to 20 late-stage trials in early 2018. This is a significant undertaking, but one that is enabled by the quality of our discovery and development teams, and by the excellent commercial momentum of Jakafi and Iclusig.","With that, I'll pass the call to Dave for the financial update.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone. The second quarter was very strong. We recorded $326 million of total revenue. This was comprised of $276 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $16 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $34 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis, and $1 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly.","Jakafi's net product revenue of $276 million represents 33% growth over the same period last year. Based on Jakafi's performance for the first six months of the year, we are increasing our full year Jakafi net product revenue guidance to a range of $1.090 billion to $1.120 billion.","Our gross-to-net adjustment for the second quarter was approximately 12%. We expect the total gross-to-net adjustment for the full year to be approximately 13%. Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $20 million. This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis on U.S. Jakafi net sales, and the amortization of acquired product rights related to the Iclusig product acquisition in Europe.","Our R&D expense for the quarter was $202 million, including $23 million in non-cash stock compensation. For the full year, we expect R&D expense to be in the range of $1.050 billion to $1.150 billion. This is an increase from the previous guidance last quarter. The increased R&D expense guidance is related to the acceleration of the Phase 3 plans for epacadostat.","Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $90 million, including $11 million in non-cash stock compensation. We recorded $7 million in expense related to the change in the fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability.","Moving on to non-operating expenses, we recorded $20 million unrealized loss on our long-term investments in Merus and Agenus, and a one-time debt exchange expense of $1 million related to senior note conversions of $20 million during the quarter. For the second quarter, we recorded a loss of $12 million, primarily due to the previously mentioned $20 million unrealized loss on our long-term investments.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $609 million in cash and marketable securities, and expect to end the year with over $600 million.","On our final slide, you'll see our full year guidance. In addition to the updates I've already mentioned, a $15 million milestone will be recognized in the third quarter for the Japanese approval of Olumiant. As a result, we now expect up to $145 million in milestones for the year. Incorporating all these previously discussed changes, including the $20 million unrealized loss on our long-term investments, we now expect a net loss between $180 million to $200 million for the year.","To summarize, our second quarter performance reflects the strength of our underlying business, as well as to continue advancement of our clinical development programs. We continue to execute on our development plans for a robust pipeline and look forward to updating you on our progress during our third quarter call.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open up the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time we will be conducting the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please state your question.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning and thanks for the question. Just on epacadostat, I want to get your perspective on the MYSTIC results and long (18:31) as it relates to epacadostat. Does it hurt the potential for triple combos? Does it give you an opportunity to substitute CTLA-4 for IDO and doublets or none of the above? And I have a follow-up.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Geoff. It's Steven answering your question. So, obviously, whenever a Phase 3 reports out negative, this is disappointing for patients and investigators involved. From our perspective with epacadostat and the planning there of our studies, it was an eventuality we, obviously, considered may happen, and it hasn't affected our plans to-date.","In terms of triple combinations going forward, that's really more in its infancy right now with us and we're still doing enabling Phase 1 work looking at that, and we haven't decided whether we'll be progressing there or not. And there is no other substitution potential, to answer the third part of your call.","So the simple answer to your question is, it hasn't impacted in terms of our execution of IDO going forward and, in our view, opens up the potential for I-O\/I-O doublet now to be cornerstoned by IDO with PD-1s in many diseases, and that's positive. In melanoma, we've always said that the PD-1 CTLA-4 doublet data, as regards response rate in PFS, is a clinical benchmark that we wanted to attain with that data. At the same time, we've always been very encouraged by the tolerability profile of our own doublet, of PD-1 and IDO. So that's my comments as regard MYSTIC right now.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then, Steven, just a follow-up to that. When you look in melanoma Phase 2 results, you guys have seen some pretty durable responses with PFS data that \u2013 I guess, someone said it took a little bit longer to mature. I wanted to get your perspective on how much of a hard stop is the assumption for ECHO-301 Phase 3 results for the first half of next year. What would you highlight as the major differences between Phase 2 and 3 in melanoma in terms of the population and things like that?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, it's me again. Thank you for your question. We updated our data last year at ESMO and, as I just said on the call, we'll be doing it at this ESMO in Madrid in September with more patient data. And you'll get some idea, albeit in a single-arm study, of what our potential progression-free survival rates are with our doublet, and I'll point you towards that meeting itself.","In terms of the ECHO-301 study and the readout, obviously, it's event-driven and we need to wait for the events to occur. All our \u2013 looking at the operational characteristics of the study point to us getting data in the first half of next year, and that's when we are expected. The benchmark there, just to be clear, is against PD-1 monotherapy, in that case pembro per their labels, which are in the 5.5 to 6-month range is what we have to beat.","Geoffrey Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a couple. One, do you plan on updating kind of the ASCO dataset we saw any time this year or is it more of a expectation for 2018? And then the second question is just, why did you kind of pick one bromodomain over the other? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Alethia, hi. It's Steven. I'll start up with your ASCO question, and then turn it to Reid on the two bromodomain inhibitors. The intent would always be at an appropriate time to update those datasets in terms of more mature data, just as we've done for melanoma, by the way, a year apart now, ESMO last year and then this ESMO. Each time it involves collecting the data, cleaning it, and doing data cuts, so it's not something we do in real time or on an constant basis. But the intent would be to update it at a time point in the future. I can't commit on this call to you for each dataset when that will be, but it will be some time in the next 24 months or so.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, Alethia, this is Reid. I'll take your BRD question. As we often do for our programs, we'll progress more than one molecule into the clinic, and that can be for various reasons. Sometimes it's a different structure, to safeguard against a safety problem that could arise with the lead compound. Other times, it can be for differential pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, so that we can evaluate the safety and early signs of efficacy of very different clinical drug profiles. And actually, both of those reasons underlie our decision some time ago to progress INCB57643 and INCB54329 into the clinic.","Those Phase 1 dose escalations are all wrapping up now, and we'll present data from each of those in the second half of the year. I don't want to get ahead of what those data show, but suffice it to say that we became quite comfortable with INCB57643 is having a more optimal profile and, because of that, it's the compound that will now progress forward into both liquid and solid tumor combination studies, and you'll learn more about those over the coming months.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan Chase & Company. Please state your question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two of them as well. First I wanted to ask about the ECHO-110 combo trial with atezo, and if you can talk a little bit more about the recruitment issues you ran into there? I mean, what do you think the problem was, and have you seen anything similar in your other PD-L1 combination trial?","And then, the second question was just with regard to that pending update on melanoma that we'll see at ESMO. Can you comment on how many patients' worth of data we can expect to see, and how much follow-up you'll have? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Cory, hi. It's Steven. In terms of ECHO-110 and the Roche-Genentech collaboration with atezo, as spoken about on the earnings call in the last few quarters, it has been one of the studies that has been a laggard in terms of enrollment. Initially the study included non-small cell lung cancer patients alone, and then was amended to try and capture metastatic bladder cancer as well. And it never took off in terms of enrollment.","It's hard to give you all \u2013 the reasons related to that, whether it was lack of interest in that particular PD-L1 combination or not. But it was always one of our collaborations because, at the time of NewLink and other reasons, that we knew that would be the case. And I don't think there is any read-through at the moment and, obviously, we'll commit to presenting that data when it's brought in and cleaned in the future.","In terms of the melanoma, I can't comment until the meeting itself, other than what I said on the actual call, that it will include both the initial patients and now the dose expansion phase as well. We will look at data in all comers in treatment-na\u00efve setting and at the 100-milligram dose, and present what we think is mature and adequate follow-up for those populations for you.","Just getting back to your question and Geoff's question, we'll also try \u2013 show the different prognostic subgroups there as regards some of the known prognostic factors, to try and ascertain and give you clarity as to what impacts prognosis here.","And then to your question and Geoff's, which I didn't answer clearly in the beginning, the Phase 3 study is in more than 600 patients and we have every belief, because of its size or \u2013 it'll be representative of a melanoma population, and will mirror what we saw in ECHO-202.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Katherine Xu with William Blair & Company. Please state your question.","Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. I'm just curious about the PI3K delta inhibitor. Can you talk a little bit about what kind of scheduling you're going \u2013 taking into further studies and also, how do you position this particular mechanism in the face of the competition, in those indications that you're going into?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Katherine, yes, hi. It's Steven. As you and others are aware, with this particular class, they're all very active compounds, and we've shown activity at our compound now at multiple meetings across B-cell malignancies, whether it's diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, marginal or mantle cell lymphomas, they're highly active. The challenge becomes tolerability for the class and, as you alluded to, how can you avert some of the longer-term toxicities? With our second generation inhibitor, we now have enough cumulative data that we look like the liver signal seen with the first generation inhibitors is not present with our particular compound. So that's very encouraging.","But in terms of on-target B-cell effects, which tend to occur later on, there are two really things you can attempt to do, either change dose or change schedule or change both. And we're looking at \u2013 without giving away everything, at trying to maintain efficacy for what we know is a very active compound. And once we have that efficacy achieved, then change in either the dose or the schedule or both, to change the tolerability profile over time. And as we gather that data, we'll be able to prove to you whether or not we can do that, because that I think is the central challenge with this class. We think we have a best-in-class highly active compound, and I'll just point you to the activity data we've shown to-date.","Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Well then, if I may, on the melanoma front, if you add epacadostat to the anti-PD-1 agents, it looks like it elevates \u2013 the response rate is potentially also prolonged PSIs (28:48) to a new level. And then, what are next steps that you think could further elevate from there, any thoughts on that?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","In terms of oncology drug development, obviously, we're always trying to move the benchmarks and increase either response rate or progression-free survival or survival itself to move the field forward. So currently it's about I-O\/I-O doublets with, in our case, PD-1 plus IDO. And then looking forward beyond that is trying to work out the populations who work in versus where you may not work in at a biomarker perspective. Then there are multiple other targets.","In our own shop, we already have GITR and OX40 in the clinic, and to come next year there'll be further I-O compounds coming into our clinic. We've an arginase inhibitor in the clinic, which is certainly interesting in terms of its biology and potentially being able to address myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and then potentially other new exciting mechanisms of action, which we may explore in combination with PD-1 and IDO or with IDO alone going forward to move that benchmark further. But it's \u2013 you have to do the slow iterative experiments and prove first where you're heading, and then execute on a Phase 3 trial to get there. You can't jump ahead of yourself. I'll leave it at that.","Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital Markets. Please state your question.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thank you and congratulations on a great quarter. I had a question in regards to the epacadostat Phase 3 program. I know you're not going to be able to speak to the design, but I was hoping you could speak to the goal. And specifically, how do you balance potentially improving on the PD-1 response in populations where KEYTRUDA and OPDIVO are effective versus potentially enhancing or entering into populations where those drugs have been ineffective? And again, the challenge we face from an investor standpoint is the predictability of small Phase 2 studies as we move on to Phase 3s and we haven't had much success yet. Just trying to get \u2013 I was hoping to get your take on how do you balance those with the risk and the opportunity that's available to you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","So, Ian, I'll start and others may want to add to what I say afterwards. Obviously, you have to aim at \u2013 in these studies at improving the event-driven endpoints, whether they're progression-free survival, overall survival, or combinations thereof, depending on the settings. Sometimes the OS is short enough that that may be the point you're trying to achieve, and that's in terms of demonstrating value for your doublet over the PD-1 alone in the settings we've selected to go after.","In terms of the therapeutic ratio, though, once you hit efficacy, obviously, tolerability comes into the equation as well. And I don't want to forget that. I've said it repeatedly. It's one thing now we have hundreds of patients worth of data with some longer-term exposures and we're very confident in our tolerability profile, and that's going to be really important going forward in I-O\/I-O doublets in general, but certainly as you compare to CTLA-4 combinations potentially.","There are populations where the tumors are either colder or where things don't work, and then it's around trying to ascertain at a biomarker level why that may not be potentially working, and then trying to address it with new MRAs (32:36), things like arginase inhibitors or other things will then weigh in. But to be clear, the Phase 3 programs are going after established entities where PD-1s, for the most part, are the care standard and now trying to improve that in terms of time-to-event endpoints, and then weighing in the tolerability profile. And if Reid wants to add anything to what I said.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, just a couple of things. I think, Ian, we sometimes forget that even in the so-called inflamed or hot tumors, where PD-1 antagonists are quite effective and are approved for use, generally your objective response rate in those populations, save melanoma, is in the 20% range. And so there is still a substantial unmet need in those populations and, obviously, our goal with the IDO1 epacadostat program is to improve those response rates, improve the patient benefit, and be able to capture a larger proportion of the patient pool to drive benefit. So that's kind of one question and it's the central question in the epacadostat development program now.","There is a separate question around what drives PD-1 resistance, either intrinsic or primary or secondary resistance, and that's very much an important focus of our discovery efforts right now as we look at multiple mechanisms that could be operative in that space and even molecules like arginase were in part brought into the portfolio and attempt to address some of the immune-suppressive mechanisms that may lead to T cell exclusion and a cold tumor phenotype. So I think both of them are actively being pursued at Incyte, some in development, some in research, and hopefully in the coming years we'll see the needle being moved in a positive way in both of those tumor settings.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","And when can we hear more about just the biomarker work that you've been doing, your biomarker that's specific to IDO that will be utilized in the Phase 3 program?","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. So the translational aspects of the ECHO program are very important. That does include assays to assess IDO1 expression directly. It also includes assessments of PD-L1 status, as you might imagine. It also includes quite a bit of RNA sequencing work to look at things like mutational burden and the inflammatory state of the tumor more generally. I think this is probably one area where we and the whole field have the most ground to make up, and it's very important for us to be able to be smarter when we select our patient populations for these doublets and ultimately triplets. And I think the translational dataset that can emerge out of the ECHO program just is one example where you have five tumor histologies and hundreds and hundreds of patients, you can imagine what a rich status that that will be for us to mine, and hopefully, be able to help move the field forward on the translational aspects of patient selection.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please state your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Maybe another question for Steven. Are we still to expect opt-in or go\/no-go decisions on epacadostat and DLBCL MSI-high patients and in combination with the AstraZeneca PD-1? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Eric, this is Steven. Very much so, all \u2013 the ongoing work will be looked at and examined on its own for signals that potentially we can pursue the two tumor types you alluded to immature at our last presentation, diffuse large B-cell and MSI colorectal. With AstraZeneca, it's the same thing as we're looking at the data now and over the ensuing months we will make decisions on whether or not there are go-forwards there. So the answer is a strong yes from my perspective.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Will those be second half, Steven?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","In terms of \u2013 assuming second half of 2017, in terms of decisions on the AstraZeneca program, yes, that is a potential timeframe we'd have the data to look at and make decisions. I think that's a fair statement.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first one on baricitinib. If Lilly does start Phase 3 trial at the suggestion of FDA, would the Incyte actually co-fund that Phase 3? If not, do you expect, I guess, downward move on your royalty rate from baricitinib?","And then second question on the Phase 3 melanoma trial in combination with Merck's KEYTRUDA. Can you talk about the powering assumption? And also based on the PFS you have seen from the ECHO-201 trial, do you think your assumption when you started a trial in Phase 3 was little bit conservative on PFS? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Maybe \u2013 Herv\u00e9 here. I will take the Lilly question. As you know, as we discussed, I mean, there are lot of decisions that has to be taken on the path forward for RA. One of these decisions have not yet been made, and obviously, based on that, we will have on our side to decide what is Incyte's position today. We are all-in co-funding the development of baricitinib. That's the situation we have today, and depending on how the plans are developing, we will have to make further decisions, but none of them have been made yet.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","And then, Ying, in terms of the statistical questions related to the ECHO-301 melanoma study, we don't address the statistics specifically of any \u2013 in any study, other than what's already been said. The primary endpoint is a co-primary of progression-free survival and overall survival. We said we can get potential approval on either and on the study the go in was 600 to begin with. So you can read into that anything you want, but we don't know any data yet and I can't comment on the actual powering assumptions around it.","The conservative nature of your question is you have to build a design on what you think, what you know for the PD-1 alone and what you think you can achieve with your doublet, but that doesn't always be what's in the end, and I think that underpins your question. But I'm not going to comment further.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Carter Gould with UBS. Please state your question.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning guys. Congrats on the nice Jakafi number and your progress. Thanks for taking the question. I guess two. First, the paired biopsy trials with the I-O doublets appear to have been pushed out or are at least sort of trending right where it's on slide 11. Can you provide some color on the status here?","And then I guess also for Steven, on the RESET study, what's the expectation on when that might read out? I know ClinicalTrials.gov says sort of mid-2020, but I guess the most comparable Novartis study is two times the size of yours, and is expected to read out in second half of 2018. So is there any nuance we're missing in the timeline here, or is this just sort of conservatism? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Carter, hi. It's Steven. On your paired biopsy question, it's \u2013 the studies have \u2013 in terms of enrollment, we've done really well. It's now collecting the tissue, analyzing what we have, doing the required testing, and then reporting it out. And that part is still underway, and there are some tricky natures to understanding, do you have adequate representative tumor samples. So we need a little bit longer, you're correct, and we expect to be able to show that data to you sometime during 2018.","In terms of the timeline for the RESET program in essential thrombocythemia, and I just want to make sure you understand that this is in a patient population who have either progressed on hydroxyurea or are intolerant of it, and then are randomized to either, in our case, ruxolitinib or the control in this case, anagrelide, with an endpoint that is a composite around platelet control and white blood cell control, and the goal is 120 patients there. And we'll have to just see. Obviously, we always want to do better on operational enrollment than what we anticipate, but we don't expect this to be an incredibly easy population to find, and that's why we have guided to mid-2020 at the moment.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Leerink. Please state your question.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. Regarding the ECHO-301 trial, is it correct to assume that the un-blinding will be triggered by PFS, and\/or will you provide both data points in the first half of 2018, PFS and OS?","And the second question is regarding your FGFR1\/2\/3 inhibitor, as well as the PI 3-kinase delta inhibitor, I think you've always talked about those as kind of the next wave of potential agents that could reach the market. I'm just wondering how we should think about the sort of potential NDA filing timelines for those two, either in DLBCL or in iCCA? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Michael. It's Steven. In terms of the dynamics around how you conduct endpoint analysis and un-blinding, it's a co-primary endpoint. Obviously, for a large Phase 3, there is a Data Safety Monitoring Board who conduct these analyses to begin with. And they will, as is \u2013 I mean, it's not a secret here, PFS would always be triggered before overall survival in terms of doing the analysis, because it delivers earlier. So, I guess the simple answer to your question is, yes, in terms of having mature overall survival data at that point in time, it will be whether it exists or not.","Just going to the part two and part three of your questions, yes, we very much like both those programs. We feel, as we've said before, for INCB54828 FGFR1\/2\/3 inhibitor, that we have a best-in-class compound. We understand the compound. We dose the patients to the pharmacodynamic endpoint of hypophosphatemia there. And we have three open studies, all of which could serve as registration potential, should they reach high response rates that are durable, and all of them are biomarker-driven in terms of targets. So metastatic bladder cancer for FGFR3, cholangiocarcinoma for FGFR2, and for that rare myeloproliferative neoplasm that's driven by chromosome 8p11, those studies are all underway and enrolling well, and we really like the compound. I think it's premature to talk about potential NDA dates there, or accelerated approvals.","For the delta inhibitor, just to reiterate the comments I said earlier, I think we've been more step-wise and careful, because of the tolerability profile and needing to understand how we can get the efficacy we know we can get, but then keep patients on therapy long enough. And so it's a little bit early to also comment on when those may potentially deliver, but we have programs in diffuse large B-cell and now in additional B-cell malignancies, like marginal and mantle cell lymphoma.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you, Steven.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Ren Benjamin with Raymond James Financial. Please state your question.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a great quarter. Maybe for Steven, can you remind us the REACH trial design? And since you're not necessarily commenting on the underlying assumptions, can you talk maybe a little bit about what's a clinically relevant results, and do the peak RUX numbers include the potential in GVHD and ET?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","So, Ren, I'll do the first part of your question, then turn it to Barry for the second part. So the REACH programs are comprehensive program. There are three pivotal studies there, REACH1, REACH2 and REACH3. REACH1 is a single-arm study of RUX in steroid-refractory acute graft versus host disease. The go in is 70 patients. The response rate, as you can see on \u2013 the primary endpoint, as you can see on CT.gov, is a 28-day response rate that would need to be durable to reach an acceptable file for a supplemental NDA, and that's felt to be an endpoint that would point to patient benefit in this particular setting, in high unmet need.","REACH2 is in the same setting, but is randomized against best available therapy, is a global study with our partner Novartis and incorporates the same endpoints. And then REACH3, again, in partnership with Novartis, is a randomized study with best available therapy as a control by physician's choice and incorporate chronic graft versus host disease, longer endpoints in terms of being able to show that you can control the disease for longer. All are acceptable endpoints and there is a lot of regulatory feedback on all those studies.","As regards the numbers in terms of predicting a revenue for RUX, I'll turn it to Barry.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, Ren, so we've said in the past that our top net sales for Jakafi will reach at least $2 billion net for MF, PV, and GVHD. We haven't included the numbers yet for ET.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And maybe just as a follow-up. And I know we've been talking about this throughout the call, but insights on how to tackle I-O combinations, just sort of based on what you're seeing right now and how a lot of the competitors, how their trials are unfolding. Do you guys dig into that quite a bit as you're meeting up with Merck and your other partners and deciding which trials to move forward with, or strategically does it kind of just makes sense to have a brute force effort, given the pre-clinical work and early stage work that you've done and tested it out yourself in Phase 3?","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Ren. This is Reid. I'll pass it over to Steven if he has anything to add. The evaluation of clinical trials and prioritization within the I-O\/I-O doublet space is an important one for us to get our hands around in the field, because I think we have enough mechanisms now, even within our own portfolio, that you can't do everything in a paired-wise comparison and just have a purely probabilistic approach to drug development. So we do hold the high bar for the preclinical data, one. And so that necessarily allows some mechanisms to move forward at a faster pace than others. Second, in the clinic, we will demand that we see the requisite pharmacodynamic activities early on in the studies to take one step towards de-risking the activity of those doublets. And the third, and this is the most difficult one, is trying to have an underlying assumption as to the patient population that's most likely to respond or benefit from the therapy.","We can think of a mechanism like arginase as a good example. Arginase is released from intratumoral myeloid cells, and it's believed that that can be an important immune suppressive mechanism that decreases immunogenicity of the tumor. So you can imagine studying an arginase inhibitor in populations, either individuals or in histologies, which have an abundance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and intratumoral neutrophils. That will be the approach that we'll take and based on the preclinical studies, we know that arginase inhibition can synergize with PD-1 access blockade and it can synergize with IDO1 inhibition. So you can imagine taking the right patient population and walking through first a doublet study, and then ultimately trying to get to a triplet study. Those are the kinds of activities we have ongoing all the time and we try to always make sure that the programs that we're transitioning into the clinic and investing in meet all three of those ends in terms of underlying preclinical data, mechanistic pharmacology in the clinic and pharmacodynamics, and then finally a patient population that's appropriate.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. We have time for one more question. And our final question comes from Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please state your question.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. Great. Just two parts to my question. First, congratulations on a great quarter with Jakafi. Maybe you could just talk about where you see growth coming from at this point going forward. Obviously, with surpassed expectations multiple times and curious as to what's driving that and where the growth is coming from and where you think it will be coming from.","And then just turning to baricitinib, outside of RA maybe you can talk about the commitment to starting some of the other studies and things like lupus and atopic dermatitis, psoriatic arthritis, stuff like that. Thank you. And I guess to that point, would those studies provide any additional safety information to satisfy FDA? Thank you.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Liisa, it's Barry. I'll take your first question and then hand you over to Steven for the baricitinib question. So on Jakafi, we continue to see growth in both MF and PV. We get new MF patients and new PV patients. As we said in the past, PV percentage-wise continues to outpace MF in terms of total growth, but MF patients continue to stay on drug therapy for a long time. So for the future, we see that will continue to grow and continue to penetrate the markets for both MF and PV, and then we'll wait for future indications for GVHD and ET, hopefully. Steven?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Barry. Liisa, in terms of programs outside of rheumatoid arthritis, we just feed off what Lilly has already told you on their call. But to reiterate, the diseases that are being considered psoriatic arthritis, atopic derm, and lupus are the ones most often mentioned. At this juncture it's just hard to comment on anything further, other than what Lilly has already told you, and all are still being considered. Your comment around would this be able to contribute safety data to a potential resubmission on a file is also I'm unable to comment on at this time. Other than any data would, obviously, be additive from a safety point of view.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your speaker, Mr. Michael Booth. Thank you, you may begin.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Danielle. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's fourth quarter and full-year 2015 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today will be made available for download on the Investor section of incyte.com following the call.","Speaking on today's call will be Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, our CEO, who will begin with a strategic review and highlight our progress during the last 12 months; and then Barry Flannelly, who leads our U.S. organization, will provide a commercial update on Jakafi. Rich Levy, who is in charge of Incyte's drug development activities, will give a brief update on our clinical progress, and Dave Gryska, our CFO, will summarize our fourth quarter and full-year 2015 financial results. Dave will also outline our financial guidance for 2016. We'll then open up the call for Q&A, for which we'll be joined by Reid Huber, our Chief Scientific Officer, and by Steven Stein, Chief Medical Officer.","We'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2016 guidance, the commercialization of Jakafi and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2015, and from time to time in our other SEC documents.","I'd now like to pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for some introductory remarks. Herv\u00e9?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to participate in our call today.","First, let me briefly cover the disappointing news we announced this morning that we are discontinuing our ongoing studies of ruxolitinib in solid tumors. This decision was driven by the discontinuation of the JANUS 1 trial and the High CRP sub-study of sub-colorectal cancer Phase II study. Both of these studies were stopped early because interim analysis, efficacy analysis did not warrant their continuation. There were no new safety signals, but we saw no separation of the survival curves, and Rich will provide more detail on subsequent actions later in our presentation.","It is also important to appreciate that this decision has no impact on our ongoing or completed studies of JAK inhibition in hematology or on our other ongoing studies of JAK1 inhibition in solid tumor which are based on different scientific hypotheses and will continue exactly as planned.","Moving now to slide 5, and as we look at the bigger picture we can see a year of significant progress. On the strategic side, we signed two very important early-stage collaborative agreements which provide us with large molecules to further expand our immuno-oncology development pipeline. The antibody discovery alliance with Agenus has already been very productive. We expect to initiate clinical trials of our anti-GITR agonist antibody in the next few months.","This is the first of several antibody candidates that we expect to emerge from the alliance with Agenus. We also in-licensed the clinical stage PD-1 antibody from Hengrui and dose escalation is already underway. Incyte Europe is now well-established and we already have a team of medical oncologists and clinical development professionals in our office in Geneva, from where we will conduct our European clinical development operations.","On the commercial side, Jakafi momentum in the U.S. and globally remains strong. The launch in PV has been a success, delivering significant growth to our top line. And we are confident that Jakafi will reach a peak of $1.5 billion in MPNs alone in the U.S.","On the clinical side, baricitinib has delivered outstanding Phase III data in RA and the regulatory applications for approval in the U.S. and EU has been submitted by Lilly. We also made the decision with Merck to move epacadostat into Phase III development in first-line melanoma in combination with pembrolizumab. We have a robust and diverse portfolio of clinical opportunities, and it is this that made the recent result from ruxolitinib in solid tumor, while disappointing, less significant to our long-term value-creation plans.","So financially, on slide 6, financially ruxolitinib provides Incyte with a steady growth driver and enables us to invest across the portfolio. In Q4 2015 we recorded $182 million in net product revenues from Jakafi and $24 million from Jakavi royalties from Novartis. This represents annual growth rate of 72% and 62% respectively. The revenue chart on the right, with Jakafi revenue in the orange bar and Jakavi royalties in the yellow bar, shows very significant growth rates for product now in its fifth year of commercialization. Total end-user fills of Jakafi and Jakavi combined reached over $1 billion worldwide in 2015. And Jakafi is patent-protected for at least the next 10-plus years.","We also expect baricitinib to provide us with a second significant source of revenue. All four Phase III studies met their primary end points, and Lilly has now submitted both the NDA in the U.S. and the MAA in Europe. These regulatory submissions have triggered $35 million and $20 million milestone payment to Incyte from Lilly that we expect to recognize in full in Q1 2016.","Furthermore, and illustrating the financial potential of our agreement with Lilly, additional milestones of $100 million will become due if baricitinib is approved in the U.S. and of $65 million if baricitinib receives a positive opinion from the European regulators. If approved, Lilly expects to launch baricitinib in early 2017, and Incyte will also be eligible for tiered double-digit royalties on Lilly's global net sales of baricitinib, which run from 20% to 29%.","Before I close my quick review I want to highlight the depth of Incyte's drug development program. In the last two years we have significantly expanded our development portfolio. In 2014 we had a portfolio that included six molecules against four different targets. We now have a portfolio of 13 development molecules against 10 different targets. Our biology and medicinal chemistry teams are continuing our in-house discovery work, and we expect our portfolio to continue to grow as we seek to bring innovative medicines to patients in need.","With that, I'll pass to Barry for a little more commercial detail.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. Jakafi had an excellent fourth quarter and concluded an excellent year for the brand. Net product revenue from Jakafi during the fourth quarter of 2015 was $182 million, an increase of 72% over Q4 2014. For the full year, Jakafi sales were $601 million, an increase of 68% over 2014. These growth rates are the result of our robust launch in polycythemia vera and continued strong growth in the number of patients treated for myelofibrosis.","Let me share a couple of data points with you on slide 11. You can see that the awareness of Jakafi as an FDA-approved treatment for PV is very high. Awareness jumped rapidly after FDA approval, and it has remained high in our latest market research data. The middle panel shows the total number of physicians who have prescribed Jakafi for PV. This number continues to grow as we continue our educational efforts.","We also believe that the duration of therapy is longer for PV-treated patients than for MF patients. The total number of new and ongoing patients on Jakafi for both indications continues to increase. And this accumulation of patients on Jakafi therapy, together with the 10-plus years of patent life remaining, offers a compelling long-term growth driver for Incyte. Today we confidently provide Jakafi net product revenue guidance for 2016 of $800 million to $815 million.","I'll now pass the call to Rich for a clinical update.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Barry. In the next three slides I'll highlight the key clinical updates. The hypothesis that JAK inhibition may have therapeutic utility in patients with solid tumors and high levels of systemic inflammation was initially supported by the results of the RECAP study, a Phase II randomized double-blind trial that suggested a survival benefit in a planned, subgrouped analysis of patients with high CRP levels.","As a result, we and the broader scientific community believed further study was warranted in pancreatic cancer and in other solid tumors with evidence of systemic inflammation. Unfortunately, the larger studies that we carried out did not confirm the hypothesis. Both JANUS 1, our pivotal study of ruxolitinib pancreatic cancer patients, and the High CRP substudy of ruxolitinib in colorectal cancer patients were stopped early because of lack of efficacy.","We have therefore decided to stop all ongoing clinical trials that are based on the systemic inflammation hypothesis. These trials include the Phase III JANUS 2 study of ruxolitinib pancreatic cancer as well as the Phase II studies of ruxolitinib in breast and lung cancer. We've also decided to discontinue the dose escalation trial of 39110, our selective JAK1 inhibitor, in pancreatic cancer as well as the companion substudy of ruxolitinib in colorectal cancer in patients with Low CRP. We intend to present the data from these studies starting later this year.","Ongoing studies of ruxolitinib in selective JAK1 inhibitors in hematology indications will continue. Ongoing studies of selective JAK1 inhibition in solid tumor indications that are based on different hypotheses will also continue. These include a series of combination studies evaluating Incyte's 39110 with either pembrolizumab, Merck's anti PD-1 antibody; epacadostat, our IDO1 inhibitor; or Incyte's 50465, our PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, to assess the therapeutic utility of JAK1 inhibition based on its effects on intertumoral immunity.","Additionally, the potential impact of JAK1 inhibition on improving the benefit of targeted therapies will be investigated through a Phase I\/II study of 39110 plus osimertinib, AstraZeneca's next-generation EGFR inhibitor.","We're also continuing Incyte-sponsored studies of ruxolitinib in MPNs and investigator-sponsored trials in a range of hematologic and solid tumors. We're also continuing with the development of topical ruxolitinib in alopecia areata and our study of JAK1 inhibitor 39110 in graft versus host disease. Finally, it's important to emphasize that all our commercial activities with Jakafi and all investigational activities with Jakafi outside of systemic inflammation hypotheses are completely unaffected by this morning's announcement.","Moving now to slide 15, Incyte is and remains a leader in IDO1 inhibition, and ECHO, the epacadostat development program, continues to advance. During the second half of 2015, and based on response rate data emerging from the dose escalation phase of the epacadostat plus pembrolizumab trial, we and Merck decided to initiate a first Phase III trial of the combination in first-line advanced or metastatic melanoma. Emerging data from the dose escalation cohorts reinforce our confidence in the activity of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab in first-line melanoma, and we expect a Phase III trial to begin in the next few months.","Melanoma is the only tumor type where we currently possess sufficient data to make a go-forward decision. We are now in the process of recruiting hundreds of patients into the Phase II dose expansion cohorts of the ongoing combination trials with PD-1 and PD-L1 targeted agents. These trials are being conducted at the recommended Phase II dose and in a total of 13 different tumor types.","By the end of 2016 we expect to have recruited approximately 600 patients across these studies and expect that these emerging data will provide us with the information we need to enable decisions on next steps beyond melanoma. We expect to provide updates in melanoma and in other tumor types starting in the second half of 2016, but note that these Phase II studies are single-arm studies and that we may be in a position to make a decision at any time to move forward in other indications depending upon the evolving data.","As you can see on slide 16, the GITR and LSD1 programs are the latest additions to our development portfolio. And given that both INDs were cleared by the FDA, we expect both to enter clinical trials in the first half of 2016. Everything is on track with both programs. Dose escalation trials of FGFR, BRD, PD-1, and PIM programs are also progressing as planned. We look forward to providing initial clinical data from 50465, our second-generation PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, during 2016.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Dave for an update on our financials.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rich. For the fourth quarter of 2015 recorded net product revenues from Jakafi of $182 million and royalties from Novartis of $24 million. Total revenue in the fourth quarter amounted to $244 million, which included $35 million in milestone payments from Novartis.","For the full-year 2015, we recorded net product revenues from Jakafi of $601 million and royalties from Novartis of $75 million. Total revenue for the full-year 2015 amounted to $754 million, which was a record for our company.","R&D expense for the fourth quarter was $117 million and $480 million for the full-year 2015. SG&A during the fourth quarter was $52 million and $197 million for the full-year 2015. We ended the year with $708 million in cash and cash equivalents.","Turning now to guidance, which assumes no strategic transactions during 2016, for the full-year 2016 we expect net product revenues from Jakafi to be in the range of $800 million to $815 million. With respect to contract revenue, we have recognized $55 million in aggregate milestone payments from Lilly in the first quarter of 2016 which, when added to the $13 million we expect to recognize over the year related to the amortization of the upfront payment from Lilly, results in a total of $68 million of contract revenue so far this year.","2016 guidance for R&D expense is between $620 million and $640 million, including non-cash expense, with approximately $55 million to $60 million related to the impact of employee equity awards. For SG&A expenses, 2016 guidance is between $255 million to $270 million, including non-cash expense of approximately $30 million to $35 million related to the impact of employee equity awards. Overall, we expect 2016 to be a break-even year on a GAAP basis.","Our final slide presents our anticipated news flow for 2016. Lilly has already submitted the NDA and the MAA for baricitinib and we expect to see continued growth from both Jakafi and Jakavi through the year. In the next few months we expect initiation of the GITR and LSD1 programs and also the initiation of the Phase III trial of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab in first-line advanced melanoma. We expect to deliver initial results from 50465, our PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor, in the first half of 2016. Looking further into 2016, we expect to be able to deliver additional data from epacadostat plus PD-1 and PD-L1 combinations as well as initial data from our FGFR and BRD inhibitors. Operator, that concludes our formal remarks. Please open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Matt Roden with UBS. Please proceed.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Hi, guys. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. First on the guidance, I might have thought that shutting down the JAK and solid tumors program might have given you a little bit of a break on the growth of R&D but we recognize you have several other programs ongoing, including epacadostat. Just trying to get a sense for whether or not or to what extent there's any of the existing JAK1 and JAK2 trials still in that R&D guidance and whether or not that would be \u2013 your R&D guidance is aggressive or conservative. And then if I'm allowed I have a pipeline follow-up. Thanks.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Matt. That's a great question. This is Dave. Our guidance includes the results from today's press releases. When you look at our guidance in terms of R&D expense, there's a lot things going on in our pipeline, a lot of value to be built for shareholders, and we believe that the guidance is appropriate and the investments we're making in the pipeline that Rich talked about today are right in line to where we have to go for our long-term plans.","So there is no, I would say, conservatism in that number. It's a number that we looked at and we thought is about appropriate for where the year is going to be.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for that clarity. And then on the pipeline side, specifically on the IDO program, we understand that you guys want to present results when you have a certain critical mass of data. But we also know that these are open-label studies and you can probably have a sense of what you're seeing along the way. So can you just talk in very general terms about whether or not the emerging data up until today still support the initial conclusions you've drawn on IDO and checkpoint combos in terms of efficacy and safety?","And then related, Rich, if you could just amplify your prepared comments on the triggers for starting additional Phase III studies. Just curious if there's competition between your collaborators about getting into lung cancer first, and at this point whether or not you would be able to rule in or rule out starting a Phase III in lung this year. Thanks.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Matt. So in terms of the data, let's first deal with melanoma. So as I said in my prepared remarks, the emerging data in melanoma remains consistent with what we've presented before and continues to support our conclusions both in terms of efficacy and safety. And we remain fully confident in our decision to start the Phase III study in melanoma with Merck within the next few months.","With respect to decisions on other programs, as you know we have very little data in any of the other tumor types, none of which was able to allow us to make a decision based on the dose escalations in the Merck study or, for that matter, in any of the other studies.","We're going to be enrolling a total of about 900 patients. We expect to enroll about 600 of them this year in the 13 different tumor types. And it doesn't mean that we need to get to the end and have scans on 600 patients to 900 patients. What that trigger will be will depend upon the data in terms of relative response rates and other information that we have.","So in no sense are we saying that there's no trigger for a Phase III this year, but we're also saying that there's not enough data to present or submit abstracts to scientific meetings that will occur within the first half of 2016. I can't really comment specifically on competition between the companies, but it is clear that it is not one or two companies that have interest in things like lung cancer and other tumor types.","Matt M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for the added color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking my question. Just wanted to get a sense of the Q4 organic growth. So if you exclude the price increase and just maybe give us a sense of inventory here. And then when you look out to 2016, what's the contribution from PV versus existing MF demand? And then I just have a follow-up on the JAK1 studies.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Hi, Salveen. This is Barry. So getting to Q4 first, so we took a 4% price increase at the end of September, so that's built into it. But we really \u2013 our demand \u2013 our inventory remains constant at about three weeks. So there wasn't a big inventory build in the fourth quarter, so you can figure out what the rest of the demand is for Q4. And then for the rest of the year...","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","For 2016, just in terms of contribution from the PV ramp versus MF demand.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Okay. So PV patients, as we know, continue to grow rapidly. At a certain point very soon, new PV patients will exceed myelofibrosis patients. But we have a very big base of myelofibrosis patients that continue to stay on therapy. So MF will continue to contribute to the top line, and PV patients will eventually \u2013 and PV sales \u2013 will eventually exceed the MF sales that we have now.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then \u2013 sorry about that. But finally, just in solid tumors, we recognize that JAK1 studies are based on immune-modulating hypothesis, and that's different from the high-inflammation hypothesis for Jakafi. But do you have any thoughts on potential read-through here in the solid tumor setting?","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Hi, Salveen. This is Reid. It's a good question, and the quick answer is no, we don't. The RECAP trial and now the broader \u2013 that led to the broader JANUS program and solid tumor program involving ruxolitinib was really focused on a unique and novel patient selection approach around elevated CRP. And as Rich and Herv\u00e9 outlined, unfortunately those studies did not meet our expectations.","But beyond that in a very distinct way our efforts with JAK1 inhibition, both with eGFR combinations and with PI3K\u03b4 combinations, are really built upon a very different hypothesis, namely that JAK-STAT signaling plays an oncogenic role, a cooperative oncogenic role and can offset the activity of otherwise effective targeted therapies, be they inhibitors of the eGFR kinase in lung cancer or in lymphomas, inhibitors downstream of a B cell receptor.","Separate from that is the emerging role that JAK1 inhibition can play in modulating intertumoral immunity. Again, a very different approach, a very different suite of combinations that we're initiating both with IDO1 and delta as well as with pembrolizumab. And of course, that's going to be in a very different set of tumor histologies, ones that generally are viewed as immune-responsive and therefore histologies that might be able to provide us an actionable signal. So I don't think there's any read-through, and I think it's very important to contrast the mechanistic differences between the various aspects of the JAK inhibitor portfolio.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks, Reid.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays.","Carter Gould - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, guys. This is Carter on for Geoff. Thanks for taking our questions. First on epacadostat, I appreciate the earlier color on your plans to report out data in 2016. Just wanted to clarify, should investors expect clinical data from each of the remaining PD-1\/PD-L1 combination studies in 2016? And then real quickly for Dave and Barry on the SG&A guide, obviously we saw SG&A reset higher following the PV approval but we're still looking for 2016 at a pretty good growth clip, 30% plus, when I think both (27:24 \u2013 27:29). Can you maybe talk about the projected drivers for that spend in 2016? Thank you.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Hi. So it was a little bit hard to hear. There was a lot of static on the line. But with respect to the data from the epacadostat trials in 2016, I don't specifically know yet whether every one of the four collaboration trials will have data in the second half of 2016.","We used the word that we would be starting to present data in the second half of 2016. But until we see how those studies enroll and whether the data gives a clear picture, we don't know that all of them will come out in the second half of 2016.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. It's Dave. On the question on the SG&A guidance, it's a mix of many different things for this year. There is a slight element in there for our work that we're doing in Europe in building that out as well as what we're doing here in the U.S. to build out further Barry's team and some more marketing expenses, plus some G&A expenses. So we're getting ready for our growth in the future years, we're making some investments this year. And I think right now, as we look at it, it's right in line with our expectations for the year.","Carter Gould - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Jefferies.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my question. A couple of questions on epacadostat. You discussed the melanoma Phase III trial design in your slide deck. Wonder if you could expand on that a little bit more in terms of potential size, timing, costs there, whether this is \u2013 one single Phase III would be sufficient, and clarify that that will not have a CTLA-4, PD-1 control arm. And then separately, I know we're expecting to see data from several other companies, combination studies with multiple checkpoints this year. I'm curious if there's any preclinical data or clinical plans to test epacadostat on top of multiple checkpoints. Thanks.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Ryan. So with respect to the Phase III melanoma design, we're not going to get very specific about this until we post the results on clinicaltrials.gov a little bit later in the year. I will say, however, that what we have guided to is that the study will be epacadostat plus pembrolizumab versus a control of pembrolizumab alone. The study will be typical for Phase III studies, but I can't \u2013 in terms of size and cost. Of course, that cost will be shared 50\/50 with Merck.","And in terms of combinations of a number of our drugs in our portfolio which have immunologic approaches, which is by no means limited to epacadostat, at this point we are interested and we have plans to start to study not only epacadostat with other drugs in our own portfolio as well as drugs in our own portfolio with PD-1s.","And as our own portfolio matures, we do plan to look at combinations. But we don't have anything to announce at this point in time with respect to anything beyond what we've specifically guided to in the past. I don't know if Reid wants to add anything. Apparently not.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking my questions. I'll stick with the two-question theme here. So I guess first probably for Reid, in addition to your R&D event what can we be expecting at AACR in terms of potentially new data? And then I have a follow-up.","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Thanks, Cory. So we'll have more to say about the presentations at AACR once titles and abstracts publish, which is a little bit later, in a few weeks. I think the theme will very much be similar to last year in the sense that we want to certainly ground people in the scientific rationale for the newest entrants into the portfolio. As Rich also mentioned, we're looking forward to being able to potentially share some 50465 data with you and provide a little bit more color on that program.","I think it also gives us a time to just sort of step back, look at the portfolio and strategy as a whole and talk about what might be some of the emerging drivers within the development portfolio that are important for us and important for you to pay attention to. So a little bit early, but we'll have more to say over the next few weeks and as we get through the end of February.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then secondly for Jakafi in PV, now that you guys are a little over a year in the market, have you noticed the discontinuation rates and compliance basically tracking in line with what was observed in Phase III and should we kind of continue to model it that way? Thanks.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Thanks, Cory. It's Barry. So we've only really launched \u2013 we've only really had 12 months of data for Jakafi in polycythemia vera. I think we'll need at least 24 months, if not more, to really figure out what is the persistency-discontinuation rate. You know that patients stay on \u2013 you know from the RESPONSE study that at least 80% of patients stayed on for two years.","Now we don't \u2013 we're not saying that that translates to what happens in every day treatment of these patients. But nevertheless it's certainly trending in the right direction, but we need more data in order to figure out what the median is for persistency.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking the question. Just two as well from me. Maybe first for Rich, going back to epacadostat in melanoma. I guess one of the criticisms of the SITC dataset was it was only 19 patients. With your new emerging data in this space, can you give us a sense of whether you're up to 25 patients, 30 patients, 35 patients when you now look at the totality of the data?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So the emerging data from the Merck dose-ranging study remains essentially those same number of patients but with additional scans on those patients. And that's part of the reason \u2013 so first, while we're not talking about the results of additional scans here, the ongoing result and more data on each patient continues to reinforce our prior decision. We are enrolling more melanoma patients into the expansion cohort, and that will contribute to future presentations of Phase II data in melanoma. But we have very little data in terms of results of scans on those Phase II patients from the expansion.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Got it. And then maybe one for Herv\u00e9 on baricitinib and the Lilly development program. It looks like they're going forward in atopic dermatitis. Are you going to be opting into that program? And maybe you can give us an update on any Eli Lilly plans to move forward in CKD?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I will let \u2013 Rich can give you details. But in general, we are at the stage where none of these decisions have yet been formalized. So, Rich, if you want to...","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So the way that we officially make decisions on buying in is we get the data from Phase II and \u2013 or proof-of-concept data from clinical trials and a cost and development plan, and then we decide whether to buy in.","So in the case of atopic dermatitis, we think it's a very interesting indication. There are data with other JAK inhibitors that have been presented suggesting that this can be quite effective. But we would not necessarily need to buy into that until we actually see data with baricitinib in that indication. But when we see good data, we would tend to buy in.","And with respect to the planned studies in diabetic nephropathy, we've seen the data from the Phase II and we are awaiting receipt of the buy-in package, which would also include the cost and design of the future studies. And we'll make the decision based on all the information when we have it.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions as well. First one I have on epacadostat development program. If you look across all the PD-1 or PD-L antibodies, there's some subtle difference in terms of their effect in the PD-L1 ligand expression, positive or negative. Have you gone back and conducted more analysis based on the collaboration data with Merck in melanoma? Do you see any difference in terms of, when you add IDO inhibitor into the PD-1, do you see any difference at all compared to monotherapy PD-1?","And then the second question I have is you're getting up to speed in terms of developing GITR in clinics now. There are two or three other programs as well from Merck, from Bristol. Can you tell us if there's any difference at all between your program and the other programs based on the pre-clinical findings? Thanks.","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Thanks for the questions. I'll try to take them both. So the first one with respect to PD-L1 testing, as you alluded to there are some differences. I would actually call them fairly significant differences between how the various PD-1, PD-L1 players try to quantify PD-L1 in the tumor microenvironment, very differences in terms of sustaining performance and whether you are quantifying L1 in a tumor cell or an immune cell. And this really leads to some pretty disparate results, as you alluded to, in terms of how those drugs perform in the various subgroups of patients.","They're basically selecting in some cases quite different patients and then you have the whole other issue around tumor heterogeneity and whether a single section really gives you a faithful representation of what's PD-L1 positive and negative.","All that being said, the translational components of our portfolio, of our programs with those collaborators are very important. We will be evaluating PD-L1 with each individual company's assay as part of the translational components of those programs and that could help us form a stronger opinion as to exactly how to select patients and which assays may be most appropriate for identifying patients more likely to respond to an IDO combination.","Importantly, there's also a number of other assays that are being evaluated in those patient cohorts, including other means of assessing sort of the inflamed microenvironment and other indices that might better reflect sensitivity of patients. So that's an emerging dataset. We're not anywhere near presenting anything definitive yet, but it's an important work in progress.","The second question you had was with respect to GITR. There are several GITR agonists in the clinic right now. You mentioned Merck, MedImmune AZ has a compound. I know another small company, GITR Inc., has a molecule. We know relatively little about the pre-clinical performance characteristics of those antibodies, how they are engineered \u2013 for example, the Fc backbone that they're on. And certainly we haven't seen any Phase I clinical data.","And I think that's the key piece of information that we need to be able to evaluate those antibodies and their quality and development programs, and it's also the key piece of data that you should look for from us to be able to establish how we may be different. As we alluded to at JPMorgan, we have an IgG1 backbone on our GITR antibody. We think that's important to facilitate agonism on the effector T cell, to facilitate signaling in both Tregs as well as ADCC of the Tregs. And in our hands, that's a very important engineered part of the antibody. Whether or not others feel the same or have different views, we'll have to see as their data emerges and they make more disclosures around their programs.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks for taking the question. Back to the SITC data in melanoma, are the additional scans and perhaps a more robust net number of patients which are adding in the cohort setting, will that be the subject of data presented at AACR or is that a Merck decision?","And second, if we actually think about your PD-1 inhibitor and the pathways in solid tumors obviously a very crowded market and a market where there is a considerable amount of dollars being spent, could you provide maybe some additional color around directionally where you want to take that? And I understand you could say, well, it's where the data are, except that you have a proxy or at least two proxies in the market of where that may be able to \u2013 for where you may be able to go. And I'm sorry, just finally on the duration, would you tell us the duration of Jakafi in both MF and PV today and whether that has changed? Thanks very much.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Hi. So this is Rich. I'll start. So with respect to the Merck melanoma data from the dose escalation cohort that was first presented at SITC, we have not submitted abstracts to any of the first half of 2015 meetings, but we do expect that we will most likely present updated data at one of the several options in the second half of the year.","With respect to PD-1, I'll turn that over to Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Maybe as a way to think about the PD-1 is obviously that there are a number of PD-1s that are in development. I think there are 10 of them, two of them are already approved, PD-1 or PD-L1. So the way we are looking at it when we did this agreement with Hengrui is that it would be a useful part of a combination strategy that involves mostly our early portfolio. So we are looking at immuno-oncology portfolio made of large molecule and small molecules and where we can see potentially from the emerging pre-clinical data that we have that some of this combination would include a PD-1. And that's really why we did the agreement that we did.","The short-term Phase III program that we are discussing with epacadostat are already going to be done with our current partners. And then when we have established the efficacy and the safety of our own PD-1, we would be working maybe with our GITR or some of the other molecule that we have in our portfolio. So the past two registrations is really something that is going to be different maybe from what other competitors are looking at because we see it as more of a product that would be used for appropriate value combinations that we would be building in the future.","Of the duration of treatment, as you know we have not discussed the PV or MF duration of treatment in practice because it's very difficult to establish. What we know and what we have said is that in PV we have clearly a longer persistency than what we have been observing in MF.","Similar to what we have seen in the clinical trials where the duration of treatment was significantly longer in PV. As Barry was saying, if you look at the median, we cannot speak about the median yet because it's still too early. It's only one year since we launched the product, but what we are expecting to see over the next 10 years you know as we are developing this MPN franchise is that the duration of treatment in PV would be longer and there would be an accommodation of patients as we have new patient flow that is now well established and where we have the existing patients staying on treatment for longer duration of time. But we have no number that we can really share with you.","Charles Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you, Herv\u00e9.","Operator","Our next question comes from Chris Marai with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Marai - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. First, just a quick one, with respect to your 2016 breakeven guidance, does that include additional milestone payments beyond the $55 million or so expected to be recognized next quarter? And then, two, on your JAK PI3K programs, I was wondering how you're looking at potential registration paths forward there.","Obviously PI3K inhibitors and JAK inhibitors, frankly, have been clinically validated. How do you look at really bringing this forward in the clinic? And in registrational trial would you look at perhaps indications where PI3K was disappointing and adding JAK1 would augment a response or offer synergistic response, or would you go after some greenfield opportunities? Thanks.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi. It's Dave. On your first question in terms of milestones, our guidance of breakeven assumes the milestones that I mentioned to you earlier in my script that we've received from Lilly, and then also the amortization of that $13 million item. So that's in the breakeven guidance. Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. And then, Chris, it's Steven Stein answering your question related to JAK and PI3\u03b4. In terms of JAK1s that are in development, we have obviously, as Rich presented, 39110 and then 52793. 39110 is about twentyfold more selective for JAK1 if you use rux as a reference.","And as Rich presented, the areas we are interested in now are graft versus host disease. And then the combination study with the AstraZeneca third-generation osimertinib EGFR inhibitor, which is, as Reid presented, builds on a different hypothesis to the CRP one. So those are both areas that are potentially registration should the data support that.","In terms of the PI3\u03b4 program, you rightly point out this is a validated target. There's an approved product from Gilead that has indications in CLL in follicular lymphoma. We have selected our second compound there, 50465, because of its potency and to date relative differentiated in terms of its tolerability profile. And we're developing datasets in both heme malignancies and solid tumors, so we're interested in a single-agent PARP there potentially and in combinations in various of our combination studies. And to date it's early but we like the look of this compound.","Christopher Marai - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","And then just on the combinations, again, would you be going after some of those opportunities that have been clinically validated, for instance, with Gilead's product and just looking to augment activity there, or would you be looking to go into sort of greenfield combo opportunities?","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Hi, Chris. This is Reid. So one of the hypotheses behind the development program with delta is to evaluate the combination potential with JAK1. Pre-clinically, that's quite a synergistic combination. We know a lot molecularly as to why that is, the B-cell receptor signaling feeds into the JAK-STAT pathway and the NF-kappaB pathway and there's a very productive autocrine loop that helps those cells to grow. And so it's an exciting thing to combine the two.","We presented a little bit of data last year at ASCO in relapsed\/refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma which I think speak to the combination potential of that doublet, and it's very much important in the program going forward once we establish the monotherapy safety and early signals of efficacy with 50465 to move into JAK1 doublets. So it's a very important part of our development program going forward. And I think as that data emerge, we'll certainly have hopefully more information to be able to share with you.","Christopher Marai - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And one last left-field question here. Just given your expertise on medicinal chemistry at Incyte and recently bringing on a PD-1 from a collaborator, do you have any plans to develop an oral PD-1 agent? Thanks.","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Chris, we don't really comment on our early discovery programs or what we're doing outside of the development portfolio. So I'm afraid I can't speak to that.","Christopher Marai - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Skip Klein with Gauss Capital Advisors.","Joseph R. Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors LLC","Yeah. Thanks. I've broken I can't tell you the number of pencils trying to value baricitinib and I was wondering if you could help me out a little bit. Given the strong clinical package, would you think I was crazy if I argued that bari could be bigger than Jakafi in terms of peak sales? And then given the very rich deal that you have with Eli Lilly, would you think I was crazy if I argued that the NPV of baricitinib is greater than the royalty stream from Novartis on in Jakavi?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Herv\u00e9 here. So it's difficult to judge about being crazy or not. I mean the entire guidance on what baricitinib could be is really in the hands of Lilly. Now the comparison you are doing, I can say, I mean the royalty rates that we have on baricitinib and we speak about 20% to 29% \u2013 it's a tiered rate based on the sales worldwide \u2013 is higher than the royalty rates that we have on ruxolitinib from Novartis. But the base is also completely different because the Novartis deal is a deal that is ex-U.S. where in fact the baricitinib partnership with Lilly is worldwide.","And I would argue that it's relatively obvious to everybody that the potential of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis is larger than what we have with our ruxolitinib in PV and MF. So when you look at the geography, when you look at the indication, and when you look at the royalty rate I would say it's not crazy to think that way.","The overall potential of baricitinib in RA, frankly, is interesting because when you look at the clinical profile and the result of the clinical studies, the Phase III studies, the superiority to Humira, it is a product that in my opinion could be very successful in a market that is relatively large. So there is a lot of upside there certainly.","Joseph R. Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors LLC","Thank you very much for that. It looks like the market, Mr. Market is saying that $3 billion was the NPV of solid tumors for Jakavi, in rough terms. And I could \u2013 busted a lot of pencils, but mostly could only get to maybe $1 billion. So what explains the $2 billion extra deterioration in value that we're seeing today?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","I cannot \u2013 it's difficult for me to explain everything. I think it is a program \u2013 frankly, it's a program that we were optimistic about. I mean we were confident that the scientific hypothesis we were pursuing was certainly worth doing the studies that we did.","So we have obviously the proof-of-concept in pancreatic cancer with RECAP and the confirming Phase III studies that we have done and in parallel evaluating in Phase II some other studies if it was also applicable outside of pancreatic cancer and lung and breast and colorectal cancer.","So I guess it depends how \u2013 what probability of success people are attaching to each of these programs. From my standpoint, when I \u2013 reacting to the news today, I mean obviously there is a certain level of saying, oops, that's not that we were expecting. But at the same time I must say that as we see the dynamic of the entire development portfolio, it is a company that has today more opportunities for value creation in the future than we had just maybe two years ago because of the quality of the molecules that we are bringing.","So it is now for us to do the work to get these products further advanced in the clinical setting, and I think what we will see is a number of opportunities to contribute to the top line over the next few years coming from our current portfolio that we have.","Joseph R. Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors LLC","Great. Merci beaucoup, \u00e0 tout \u00e0 l'heure.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Merci.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi there. Thanks for squeezing me in. A quick question. First just theoretically, as you think about what you've seen so far for rux in the solid tumor setting with respect to sort of the onco inflammation component, are you more pessimistic about your particular molecule, or do you think this whole concept perhaps is not what you thought it was? As we think about \u2013 there are some other people pursuing this approach as well. I was just curious about scientifically where you lie on that.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","This is Rich. So all I would say is that the two negative studies with ruxolitinib in pancreatic and colon were enough for us to also stop with our own JAK1 inhibitor. But we really can't comment on whether anybody else's molecules may have a different profile or not and whether they will succeed or not.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","And maybe a supportive comment on that, to put some perspective on that. We get the top-line results from these studies. At the interim level, it was a primary endpoint is what we look at. And it's really a question of is there a chance for these studies to be positive as planned, and the answer was no. And that's why we decided to change the program. Now we will have a lot of data that will be analyzed over the next few months.","And so I think to better answer your question of saying where was the sort of the problem between the hypothesis and the Phase III studies, I think at the end of the process, when we are able to analyze the data including the data in blood cancer, on lung cancer for the few patients we have in that study, I mean that will give us a better picture of exactly what is the situation there.","I think today it was more a decision that was based on the fact that the chance of having a positive study at the end was in fact very, very, very low. And it was the right thing to do for patients and for investigators and the company to discontinue the program at this stage. So...","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then just a couple of commercial questions. Can you give us any more details on the breakdown of sort of where things are right now with respect to MF versus PV? And then any gross to net info you can provide would be helpful.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Sure, Liisa. It's Barry. So in terms of \u2013 so MF, we still have a large number of patients and they continue on therapy for long periods of time. As I said before, we'll actually \u2013 PV sales will eventually outpace MF sales. In terms of gross to net, obviously we just \u2013 we have those discounts that everybody else has, and we're trying \u2013 we always try to maintain the value of the brand.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","So in Q1, though, the question is I suppose maybe you were getting at is that obviously we have a gross-to-net decline in Q1 just because 50% of our patients are Medicare patients and we have to close the donut hole. So we're picking up $1,800 or so of that cost for all patients in the donut hole. So that impacts our gross-to-net. And therefore, our growth from Q4 2015 to Q1 2016 could be impacted by a lower gross-to-net in the first quarter versus the rest of the year.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. And then just wanted to clarify, this is my last question, I think I heard Herv\u00e9 say MPNs could be $1.5 billion in the U.S. Was there some timeframe around that? Or maybe you could clarify, I wasn't completely sure if I heard it correctly.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","No, you heard correctly. In the U.S., MPNs, like MF and PV, that's the guidance we \u2013 the guidance is our long-term potential number that we gave a few months ago, a year and a half ago \u2013 six months ago, sorry. Six months ago. And basically it's reflecting two things. It's reflecting the fact that we are in a market that has a lot of potential. So the number of patients that could potentially be treated with ruxolitinib and where we are today gives us a lot of room to grow.","We have also 10-plus years before the first possible patent expirations. So that gives us a long runway. As you see, I mean we are speaking of a guidance for next year that is north of $800 million. So the $1.5 billion is really reflecting the fact that we see long-term growth for this franchise in the U.S. in the current indication that is very possible. It's also an indication where in MF we have a low competitive situation in the long term.","There are other products trying to be developed in MF, but it's not the most crowded market. And in PV in fact there are very few products that are developed for PV. So if you look forward over 10 years, what we are saying is that we see this franchise as one of the growth engine for the top line of the company. And the $1.5 billion is a way to calibrate a little bit for everybody what we have in mind.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ren Benjamin with Raymond James.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Sorry about the rux results in solid tumors, but congrats on a steady growth in MPNs. Two questions, just one maybe for Barry. Can you talk \u2013 I think you mentioned that there are about 1,250 or maybe 1,500 docs prescribing for PV. Can you give us a sense as to what the target number of docs may be to reach your peak numbers given the current script rate?","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Sure. I'm not sure it's about the total number of docs. We're very happy that more and more docs are prescribing Jakafi for PV, but it's really more about the number of patients that will benefit. So eventually we'll have all of the docs who see PV patients and MF patients prescribe Jakafi at some point, but it's really making sure that in fact we help them identify patients that are truly going to benefit.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","How may docs is that?","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Well, it's really the total number of oncologists and hematologists in the United States, which is probably about 8,000. It could be as many as 11,000, but about 8,000 practice. So...","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. I was just trying to get a sense is it following kind of like the 20\/80 rule of 20% of the docs are giving out 80% of the scripts in an indication like PV.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","PV is a little bit different than lots of other tumors or lots of other cancers, and that includes MF patients, too, because each doc may have only one or two patients. So it's really about them identifying patients that could truly benefit from Jakafi.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. And just one last question for Rich. The Phase III program with epacadostat, just given sort of the changing landscape in melanoma, can you just take us through the rationale of why you guys elected maybe not to run a non-inferiority study comparing epacadostat and Keytruda with Opdivo and Yervoy, for example?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So we agree that it's difficult to compare across studies, but based on the results that we had seen and presented at SITC and continues to be our belief, we feel that we have the ability to demonstrate that the combination of pembro plus epacadostat will both be better than pembro, which is the registration end point, as well as to be comparable in terms of efficacy to the published Phase III data and label data for nivo plus ipi.","But we didn't feel that it was necessary to add a third arm to that study comparing to that other combination. And of course the emerging data indicates that the safety profile of epacadostat plus pembro is not very different than pembro alone, which is not the case for the combination of nivo plus ipi.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Great. Thanks. And if I can just sneak one in for Dave. I think Lilly mentioned that they're going to be filing in Japan in the next couple of months. Can you give us a sense as to the milestone you would expect from that filing?","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No. We're not \u2013 with our Lilly agreement, not allowed to go there on that particular \u2013 if there's any milestone payment at all. I think an early question said what do you project for your milestones, and it was really an area that I gave in the script in terms of the two milestones we received from Lilly already in Q1 that I talked about plus a minor amount of amortization of $13 million.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thanks, guys. And good luck.","Operator","Our next question comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions, squeezing me in. Just maybe two quick ones. Just one, I wonder if you could talk a little bit about maybe the potential for combinations with like the bromodomains or the FGFR program that we may get data on throughout the year. And then also on the IDO, some of the newer ones that are much, much earlier stage that popped up. Just maybe help us think about like how those assets compare. Do you think that there's reasonable similarity? Just kind of help us think about how like some of the newer assets may fit, since you guys are the leader there. Thanks.","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Thanks, this is Reid. So on your first question in terms of combinations with the early pipeline, as we spoke about a little bit last year at AACR, and we'll revisit this a little bit coming up again in April this year at the meeting, we sort of tried to construct a portfolio that has a pretty high combination coefficient. And that doesn't mean that that's the only development path that a molecule like the bromodomain inhibitor, for instance, could take. But it's certainly one that we want to explore early on in the development program, both as a way to broaden the opportunity space where we could take a mechanism like that but also to potentially increase the depth or breadth or durability of response.","So those are all the key tenets behind why we're interested in combinations and why molecules like the bromodomain inhibitor or the PIM inhibitor or, honestly, the LSD1 inhibitor are particularly attractive as they sort of coalesce in our portfolio.","On the IDO inhibitor front, in terms of the competition, we're very pleased at the competitive environment we have right now, which is still relatively open. We have a molecule from NewLink Genetics that is partnered with Roche, and we've seen a little bit of data on that molecule. And I'm sure we'll see other IDO inhibitors in the future, but those are all going to be relatively early stage.","And I think we have a pretty wide competitive gap that we can leverage, especially as we work towards enrolling upwards of 600 patients in more actionable Phase II program across 13 histologies. So hopefully that competitive gap only increases and it's of course very difficult for me to comment on any of the other IDO inhibitors, particularly those that have yet to be in a clinic or show any clinical data that I can speak to cogently.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Our last question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for the quick follow-up. I guess this one is for Dave. I know you've been working for a while on trying to figure out ways to moderate Incyte's future tax rate. If there's any update on that or when we might get an update on that would be much appreciated.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi, Eric. Thanks for the question. We'll give you an update towards the end of the year. I think there's another leg up that we're trying to work on with our infrastructure and our supply chain in Europe right now. And again we're working on that in terms of trying to manage that all through an international location. So by the end of the year we'll be able to give you more color on that.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","This concludes our question-and-answer session.

And welcome to the Incyte Fourth Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Booth, Head of Investor Relations for Incyte. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Booth","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's fourth quarter and full-year 2019 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com.","I am joined on the call today by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks, and by Dash who will join us for the Q&A session.","During the question-and-answer session, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and, if needed, one follow-up as this will enable as many of you to ask questions as time allows.","Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2020 guidance, the commercialization of our products and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline, as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners.","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019, and from time to time in our other SEC documents.","It is also important to note that our recently announced collaboration with MorphoSys for the global development and commercialization of tafasitamab is subject to clearance by antitrust authorities and, therefore, any statements we may make about the collaboration and tafasitamab are conditioned on such clearance.","We'll now begin the call with Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone. So, 2019 was another year marked by strong commercial performance, including surpassing $2 billion in annual revenue for the first time. In addition, we continued to advance our R&D portfolio and make progress towards our strategic goal of diversification and growth. ","During the year, we achieved 13 of the 15 key goals we laid out this time last year, including the approval and successful launch of Jakafi in steroid-refractory acute GVHD. ","While the results of the GRAVITAS-301 trial of itacitinib was disappointing, we announced positive result of the Phase III REACH2 trial. We submitted the NDA for pemigatinib based on strong updated data, and we are very pleased to recently report positive top line Phase III results from rux cream in atopic dermatitis. ","In addition to our internal portfolio, we continued to seek external assets that could complement our business. Our recently collaboration with MorphoSys for tafasitamab represents a strong fit with our portfolio and we expect to be able to capitalize on our commercial expertise in the US and Europe. ","Turning now to our commercial performance in 2019. We had another year of robust top line growth. Product and royalty revenues grew 22% year-over-year, with growth coming from all four sources. Jakafi was up 21%, Jakavi royalties up 16%, Iclusig up 13% and Olumiant royalties doubled to $80 million.","Slide 5 shows the revenue momentum over the last several years. Product and royalty revenues have more than tripled since 2016. Jakafi, with a four-year CAGR of 29%, remains a significant revenue driver and non-Jakafi revenues have shown over a 50% compounded growth over the same period. ","Two new molecules, both of which were discovered at Incyte, are currently under priority review at the FDA. And these are highlighted on slide 6. Both have breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA. ","The PDUFA date for pemigatinib is May 30 and we expect the FDA decision on Novartis application for the approval of capmatinib in around six months' time. The capmatinib economics to Incyte include royalties in the range of 12% to 14% on global net sales by Novartis and over $500 million in potential milestone.","Tafasitamab, from our recently announced collaboration with MorphoSys, is a sub molecule currently under FDA review. We see CD19 inhibition with an Fc-engineered antibody as a unique mechanism of action that is fundamental to the treatment of B cell malignancies.","We believe that tafasitamab can become a very important part of our oncology portfolio, and provides both near-term opportunities with a potential launch in DLBCL where the BLA was submitted late last year and the MAA is expected to be submitted mid this year, as well as significant potential upside in the medium to longer term. ","Tafasitamab fits very well with our current commercial hematology footprint and, therefore, enable us to capitalize on our significant commercial capabilities in US and Europe. ","Turning now to the key development and commercial priorities for 2020. We have the three potential new product approvals this year that I have already mentioned and we also expect to submit the NDA for rux cream in atopic dermatitis before the end of the year. ","We also expect to continue the momentum within our LIMBER program, with the initiation of the first pivotal combination development trial, as well as important data from the once-a-day formulation of ruxolitinib.","On the commercial side, we will work to drive continued Jakafi growth in all three indications, while also ensuring that we are ready to pursue successful launches of pemigatinib and tafasitamab. ","I will now pass to Barry Flannelly for more detail on both 2019 Jakafi performance as well as our commercial preparations for pemi and tafa.","Barry Flannelly","Thank you, Herv\u00e9. Good morning, everyone. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Jakafi grew 23% year-over-year to $466 million. Patient demand continued to drive the uptake of Jakafi and growth was strong across all three indications. Jakafi has grown consistently in total patients treated and net sales for each of the past several years, fueled by growth across all indications. ","The 2020 net product revenue guidance we provided for Jakafi today reflects a continuation of this growth in patients and in top line sales to a range a of $1.88 billion to $1.95 billion. ","Slide 11 also highlights the key priorities for our US team this year. These priorities include continuing the growth of total patients treated in myelofibrosis; increasing the number of patients on therapy in polycythemia vera, where we recently launched a nationwide disease awareness campaign; and continuing the momentum in GVHD, where we have seen strong traction since the launch in the steroid-refractory acute setting. ","We look forward to the presentation of data from REACH2 in the Presidential Symposium at the EBMT meeting next month and to the results of REACH3 in the second half of this year. REACH3 is the randomized, Phase III trial of Jakafi versus best available therapy steroid-refractory chronic GVHD.","In addition, we're also planning for the potential launches of both tafasitamab and pemigatinib. We expect to be able to leverage our commercial expertise for both compounds and we will be ready to launch immediately if approved by the FDA. ","I'll turn the call over to Steven for our clinical updates. ","Steven Stein","Thanks, Barry. And good morning, everyone. At the beginning of 2019, we had laid out a list of key R&D goals for the year, and I'm pleased to say that we achieved most of what we set out to do. ","While the recent results of GRAVITAS-301 was disappointing, we were able to report multiple successes last year. Some highlights include the positive top line result reported for the randomized REACH2 trial of ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease; the submission of an NDA for pemigatinib in cholangiocarcinoma; and the initiation of pivotal trials for ruxolitinib cream in both atopic dermatitis and vitiligo. ","We recently announced that the first of two Phase III trials evaluating ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis met its primary endpoint, and I'll cover this on the next slide. ","We were pleased to announce that our pivotal Phase III TRuE-AD2 study achieved its primary endpoint of proportional patients with an IGA treatment success following eight weeks of therapy. This is the first of two identical pivotal trials, and we expect the results of TRuE-AD1 later in the first quarter. ","In terms of study design, TRuE-AD2 recruited approximately 600 patients with mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis. Inclusion criteria included an age range of 12 to 75 years of age, an IGA score of two to three, and a percentage body surface area affected of 3% to 20%.","Patients were randomized 2 to 2 to 1 to 0.75% rux cream b.i.d., 1.5% rux cream b.i.d. and a vehicle cream respectively and were on therapy for eight weeks, at which point all eligible patients could either switch to or continue on 0.75% or 1.5 rux cream b.i.d. for the long-term safety extension period.","In the Phase II TRuE-AD2 study and for both doses, the efficacy data is measured in the primary and secondary endpoints, as well as a safety profile or consistent with previous data from our Phase II program, which as a reminder were presented at EADV in 2018 and have since been published in manuscript form in JACI.","As required by the FDA for dermatologic studies, long-term safety data are being collected, and we continue to expect to submit the NDA for ruxolitinib cream in Q4 of this calendar year. ","I wanted to take this opportunity to briefly walk through the summary clinical development program for tafasitamab. With MorphoSys, we intend to pursue development in both relapse\/refractory and frontline diffuse large B cell lymphoma, as well as in relapsed\/refractory CLL and other non-Hodgkin's lymphomas.","For relapsed\/refractory diffuse large B cell lymphoma, L-MIND was the basis for the BLA submission seeking approval of the combination of tafasitamab plus lenalidomide. The B-MIND Phase III study is also underway, assessing tafa versus rituximab, both on top of bendamustine.","The futility analysis for B-MIND was passed in late 2019 and primary completion is estimated for 2022. Tafa has also been evaluated in front line diffuse large B cell lymphoma. ","The safety portion of the first MIND study is expected to be completed later this year whereupon we expect to start the pivotal portion of the program.","As it relates to relapsed\/refractory CLL and other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, based on some promising data of tafa in combination with a PI3 kinase delta inhibitor in the COSMOS trial, we expect to initiate a trial of tafa plus our own PI3 kinase delta inhibitor parsaclisib in 2020. ","Moving on to our LIMBER project on slide 16, which is our initiative focused on expanding our leadership within MPNs BEyond Ruxolitinib. Later this year, we expect initial bioavailability and bioequivalence data for once-a-day ruxolitinib, which is an important step towards a potential launch in 2022. ","We expect to begin proof-of-concept combination trials of ruxolitinib at both our BET and L2 inhibitors during this year. And we also plan to initiate a pivotal trial combining ruxolitinib with parsaclisib in myelofibrosis patients, with a suboptimal response to ruxolitinib monotherapy based on encouraging proof-of-concept data. ","This initiation would mark the first pivotal trial within the LIMBER program. ","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for the financial update.","Christiana Stamoulis","Thank you, Steven. And good morning, everyone. The financial update this morning will include GAAP and non-GAAP numbers. For a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP, please refer to slides 25 and 26 in the backup section of the deck and to the press release we issued this morning. ","Our fourth quarter results reflect continued strong revenue growth across all products, with total product and royalty revenues of $579 million, representing an increase of 24% over the fourth quarter of 2018. ","This is comprised of $466 million in Jakafi and $24 million in Iclusig net product revenues, $65 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis and $24 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly. ","Our total cost and expenses for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis of $434 million increased by 10% from the prior-year quarter. As you can see, the growth rate in total costs and expenses was well below the growth rate in product and royalty revenues. ","Ongoing R&D expense for the quarter was $282 million on a non-GAAP basis, representing a 3% increase from the prior-year quarter. This was primarily due to our existing pipeline programs progressing to later stages of development, and was partially offset by our election to end additional co-funding of development of baricitinib with Lilly. ","SG&A expense for the quarter was $123 million on a non-GAAP basis, representing a 27% increase over the prior-year quarter. This was primarily due to an increase in the commercialization efforts related to Jakafi.","Looking at full-year 2019 results, total products and royalty revenues of $2.08 billion grew 22%, while total costs and expenses stayed relatively flat at $1.55 billion on a non-GAAP basis. ","As a result, non GAAP operating income increased by 88% from $325 million in 2018 to $610 million in 2019. Looking at the trend from 2016 through 2019, the growth in our product and royalty revenues has exceeded the growth in both our ongoing R&D expense and SG&A expense on a non-GAAP basis, leading to higher operating leverage and reflecting our commitment to disciplined management of our financial resources. ","Moving on to 2020, I will now discuss the key components of our 2020 guidance. Please note that the guidance we provide today does not include the financial impact of our recently announced collaboration with MorphoSys, which has not yet closed, and also excludes the impact of any additional potential future strategic transactions.","For the full-year 2020, on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis, we expect net product revenue for Jakafi to be in the range of $1.88 billion to $1.95 billion, driven by continued growth across all indications. ","For Iclusig, we expect net product revenue to be in the range of $100 million to $105 million. As in previous years, we will not be providing guidance for milestone or royalty revenues. ","We expect our gross to net adjustment for 2020 to be approximately 16% for Jakafi, with the adjustment in the first quarter of the year being higher relative to both the previous quarter and subsequent quarters. ","We expect the GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $1.21 billion to $1.28 billion and non-GAAP R&D expense to range from $1.08 billion to $1.15 billion. The increase compared to 2019 is primarily driven by our existing pipeline programs progressing to later stages of development.","We expect the GAAP SG&A expense to be in the range of $505 million to $535 million and non-GAAP SG&A expense to range from $447 million to $477 million. The increase compared to 2019 is primarily driven by efforts to support the expansion of our commercial portfolio and investment in infrastructure to support the continued growth of the business. ","Both in the case of R&D and SG&A, the non-GAAP expense guidance excludes estimated stock-based compensation expense. ","I will now turn the call back to Herv\u00e9 for further discussion of the year ahead.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Christiana. So, 2019 was a strong year in terms of business performance and pipeline progression. And as you can see on slide 23, 2020 is shaping up to be another busy and important year for Incyte. ","In my opening remarks, I laid out our key priorities for the year. And here, we have highlighted the five key regulatory updates that we expect, which are the FDA decision on pemigatinib, tafasitamab and capmatinib; the MAA submission of tafa and the NDA submission of rux cream.","We also look forward to providing numerous other data announcements as the year progresses. ","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks and please give your instruction and open a call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question today is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC. Your line is now live.","Brian Abrahams","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my question. And congrats on the continued commercial performance and on the TRuE-AD2 results. ","On topical rux, I was wondering if you could talk about your expectations for whether there might be ultimately a boxed warning on the label with respect to class safety. What, if any, impact you think that might have on dermatologists' view and uptake of the agent ultimately? ","And I guess, along those lines, any type of work that you have done or expect to do over the course of the program to fully characterize systemic exposure and maybe the relative importance of that as you think about a future label there and adoption? Thanks.","Steven Stein","Brian, Steven. Thank you for your question. The data that we've already presented both at EADV and then published in a paper in JACI shows the safety profile to date for our topical rux cream. Obviously, what you referenced in terms of box morning has to date largely applied to compounds that give you substantial systemic exposure. And what we've already published, we have little to no systemic exposure. We have a very clean safety profile. So, given all of the above, we don't think that we're going to be in that territory of having a box warning. Obviously, ultimately, it's up to the FDA and not to us. But, again, given the little to no systemic exposure seen to date, the very clean safety profile, we don't expect that. And then, we'll update the safety as this year goes along, with more long-term data. But that's our expectation currently.","Brian Abrahams","Thanks, Steven. I'll hop back in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Marc Frahm from Cowen and Company. Your line is now live.","Marc Frahm","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. This is for Herv\u00e9 and Christiana. With the MorphoSys deal, assuming this closes, you'll have about three products probably launching in the next year-and-a-half or so. So, I'm just wondering kind of the appetite for continued M&A and should we expect that you might do more larger deals like the MorphoSys deal for late stage assets? Or do you think you're kind of done on that end of the pipeline and we should really be more focused on kind of smaller, earlier stage deals going forward?","Christiana Stamoulis","Hi, Marc. Thank you for the question. So, in terms of the bidding strategy, it hasn't really changed from what it was before the MorphoSys deal. We are continuing to look at external assets to complement or supplement our internal activities. And the focus is similar to what it was before, looking at programs that could help diversify and continue to grow revenue, programs that allow us to capitalize on our existing capabilities in oncology, hem, MPNs, of course, and more on the bolt-on type of transactions versus larger deals.","And when you look from a capacity point of view, we ended the year with $2.1 billion of cash on the balance sheet. The pro forma for the MorphoSys transaction is $1.2 billion. So, we still have capacity to continue to look for those bolt-on type of transactions.","Marc Frahm","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tyler Van Buren from Piper Sandler. Your line is now live.","Tyler Van Buren","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. With respect to the TRuE-AD results, in the press release, there's one line which appears pretty deliberate and was repeated in the press release this morning where you guys state that the overall efficacy and safety profile of ruxolitinib cream is consistent with previous data. And I know you guys can't speak about the data. But I guess just with respect to that statement, could you say that it's consistent with the effect size compared to vehicle as we think about it relative to prior data? ","And then, just as a quick follow-up, just can you talk about the potential conferences that you guys might present data at? I'm assuming that you would wait for the results from TRuE-AD1 as well.","Steven Stein","Tyler, it's Steven. Thanks for your question. So, just the back part of your question first, the TRuE-AD1 results will come sometime this quarter and, obviously, we are awaiting them and we expect them to be in line with TRuE-AD2 and then, again, with the proof-of-concept data. What we're trying to communicate as much as we can without actually giving the actual results because we have to protect future meetings when we want to present the data as soon as possible is that, directionally and quantitatively, the active arms, the 0.75% and 1.5%, were in line with the primary and secondary efficacy endpoint seen in the Phase II data and the vehicle was as well, which is very encouraging. So, when we went from 150-patient proof-of-concept study to a 600-patient Phase III in TRuE-AD2, we're seeing the same quantitative results in terms of the primary and secondary efficacy, as well as the safety. And that's as much as we can say to try and protect both the presentation and a future manuscript, which we hope to be able to do. ","Tyler Van Buren","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Your line is now live. ","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask on Jakafi. Just with regard to your 2020 guidance, looks like it implies growth of \u2013 I think it was 12% to 16%. Can you just qualitatively discuss how much of this is coming from GVHD versus the longer-term indications of MF and PV? ","And then also, can you just comment on what happened with the Jakafi RESET study in ET? It's in the press release that recruitment was discontinued. So, curious what happened on that front. Thank you.","Barry Flannelly","Hey, Chris. It's Barry. I'll let Steven handle the RESET study. But as far as the growth goes, we're very encouraged by the approval and launch in acute steroid-refractory GVHD for Jakafi. That continues to now add a significant portion to the overall net sales. But myelofibrosis continues to be the largest portion of our net sales, while PV, the total percentage of patients continues to increase at a faster rate than MF. But those two indications, MF and PV, will drive the indications. ","Obviously, we've talked before, whether it's acute GVHD or chronic GVHD, the total population in the United States in the steroid-refractory setting is about 3,000 patients. And obviously, you know that it's a much larger patient population. So MF and PV will continue to drive the growth towards $3 billion, ultimately, but GVHD is now a significant contributor to that. ","Steven?","Steven Stein","Cory, in terms of the RESET study, so that's looking at ruxolitinib in a central thrombocythemia, the study design was a little bit complicated because of the composite endpoints. So, the endpoint that was required in negotiation with the regulatory agencies was to obtain control of blood counts in terms of both the white blood cell count and the platelet count together, and not an event endpoint like thrombosis.","So, what was required in terms of eligibility was patients coming on who had either intolerance or progressed on hydroxyurea, had a white blood cell count above 11,000 and had no prior exposure to anagrelide because the study was randomized against anagrelide. And trying that for more than a year, in fact, longer, we were just unable to enroll sufficient number of patients in a timely manner. We looked at various amendments to try and get around this, but ultimately because of that composite endpoint, we couldn't do that in terms of either the white count or prior anagrelide. ","So, the current thinking is to change it to a publication strategy, finish up the study and publish it. But it will not be of registration quality in terms of its size.","Cory Kasimov","Okay, thank you. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vikram Purohit from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Vikram Purohit","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. So, I had a question on your commercialization plans for rux cream. So, you previously noted that you're still thinking through your options when it comes to whether you'd like to pursue commercialization independently or to find a partner for Europe. And I just wanted to see if you're thinking here has evolved or changed at all based on the first set of Phase III data you saw based on the recent readout.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Herv\u00e9 here. So, the recent readout is obviously improving our optimism regarding the chance of getting regulatory approval in the US, where you know we have","decided to go by ourselves.","Regarding the rest of the world, as I said previously, things have not really changed. There's a high probability we'll have a partnership regarding Asia. And in Europe, we are still in the process of looking at what options we have, either going alone, licensing out completely or some form of a partnership and each of the three option is still open regarding Europe.","Cory Kasimov","Okay, understood. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Evan Seigerman from Credit Suisse. Your line is now live. ","Evan Seigerman","Hi all. Thank you for taking my question. Congrats on the progress. So, I noticed in the press release, there was updates on the low-dose itacitinib trial in ulcerative colitis and also parsaclisib in Sj\u00f6gren's disease. Can you help me understand why the UC trial was continued and what you saw in the data from the Sj\u00f6gren's trial not to warrant continuation?","Steven Stein","Sure, Evan. It's Steven. Thanks for your question. In terms of the low dose itacitinib in inflammatory bowel diseases, particularly ulcerative colitis, again, it was around operational dynamics in a competitive space. So, we were unable to enroll sufficient numbers of patients to keep progressing the study, as well as, given the competitive space with other compounds with similar mechanisms being way ahead, we elected at the end of last year to no longer pursue that program. ","In terms of Sj\u00f6gren's, again, a difficult medical condition in terms of measuring endpoints and getting sufficient spread versus standard of care or even placebo. We've not seen enough of the activity to warrant going forward into a full registration program. It was a proof-of-concept study. And in our opinion, we didn't get to the proof of concept we wanted to pursue registration further there.","Across inflammation and autoimmunity, one of the beauties of the program is we have this pipeline of targeted therapy agents, immunooncology agents, all of which were primarily in the beginning developed for either hematology or oncology indications, but because of their mechanism of action, either in terms of JAK inhibition or B cell inhibition with delta inhibitors, they lend themselves to conditions in the inflam autoimmune setting where those mechanisms are important. So, we have the ability to conduct multiple proof-of-concept studies very efficiently and then make decisions to go forward or not. And in those two instances, it didn't meet our own internal expectations to pursue registration programs.","Evan Seigerman","All right. Thank you for the color. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Your line is now alive.","Jay Olson","Thanks for taking the question. And congratulations on the financial performance in 2019. You delivered impressive non-GAAP operating margin growth last year. And since you're now investing in multiple new product launches over the next year or two, do you expect to continue growing operating margins at the same rate? And where do you see them going longer term? ","And then, maybe if I could just ask a follow-up question on q.d. Jakafi, do you expect any clinical benefits versus b.i.d. Jakafi? And if so, would those benefits appear in the label? Thanks.","Christiana Stamoulis","Hi, Jay. It's Christiana. Let me take the part on the margins. As you can see, both in the case of 2019 and with the guidance that we provided for 2020, we are looking to continue to invest in supporting our portfolio, both from the R&D and commercial side, but the growth on the expense front is slower than that of the top line, which is what we had indicated in the past. And as you can see, we are in line with what we have said. We'll continue to invest in our activities in the company on the R&D front. As we have discussed in the past, we will be looking to invest based on the quality of the programs. And if data supports moving programs into development and later stages of development, we'll continue to do that. But the trends that we see is continuing to have growth on the expense side being below that of the top line.","Steven Stein","Jay, in terms of your question for the once-a-day formulation, so the work with that is progressing very well. The intent is to follow a 505(b) route in terms of, first, obtaining sufficient bioavailability in terms of PK of a different strength and then moving on to prove those individual different once-a-day strength meet the bioequivalence in terms of the ratios on the FDA guidance for each of the strengths you're matching it up with. ","So, there's no in the beginning \u2013 it's not built around clinical differentiation, if you will. It's built around BA\/BE route to obtain approval in that 2022 time frame. ","We do know from a publication in 2011 with a single once-daily strength, 25 mg XR strength, not surprisingly, the PK profile was flatter. So, there was less of a Cmax, which we think is related to the anemia seen in myelofibrosis. And there may be, ultimately, less anemia with these products. ","That will need to be proven down the pike once we've finished the once-a-day formulation work. Once we've taken it to the BA\/BE route and gotten approved, then we could potentially do clinically differentiating work to see if there is a flatter profile with all the strengths and, ultimately, less anemia and then make that claim and get it in a label. So, it's a very step-wise approach.","Jay Olson","Great. Thank you very much.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","If I may add on q.d. strategy \u2013 the strategy around the q.d., there is, obviously, this practical aspect of q.d. That is this potential clinical benefit maybe on anemia, which was discussed, and there is the ability to combine with other mechanism that have a once-a-day regimen. So, this project by itself has a lot of potential positive consequences on the management of the lifecycle of Jakafi.","Jay Olson","That's super helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now alive.","Andrea Tan","Great. Thanks for taking our questions. This is Andrea on for Salveen. The first one, as you look to the upcoming launch for pemigatinib and cholangiocarcinoma, can you talk a little bit more about how you've approached building out a solid tumor sales force and the efforts that might be needed for patient or physician education to improve the disease awareness as well as the need for diagnostic screening? And then, I have a follow-up.","Barry Flannelly","Sure, Andrea. This is Barry. First, we're actually launching in cholangiocarcinoma and this patient population that has FGFR2 fusions or rearrangements. We're already educating, providing healthcare professionals, getting them ready to, in fact, always test cholangiocarcinoma patients for various mutations, alterations and so forth. So, those educational efforts are ongoing now. ","In terms of FTEs that we've put in the field, we do have a few more FTEs in the field, but the way it works in the United States, we have now 147 representatives across the United States and they call on community oncologists and academic centers across the nation. Even though there's people who are specific to hem and solid tumor, most of the community oncologist offices throughout the United States treat both. And certainly, geographically we hit all of the centers. So, we will have a dedicated team that's specifically trained on solid tumors, and particularly pemigatinib and cholangiocarcinoma and, of course, the need for NGS testing or diagnostic testing to remind all of these healthcare professionals that are treating these patients. But, in fact, we have oncology clinical nurse educators who are providing educational services. We have medical science liaisons that are all trained. So, each of the teams have already been trained and we have ongoing training for the sales force. ","So, we think we're in solid shape and we're going to continue to educate all healthcare professionals about the need for diagnostic testing to best help these patients.","Andrea Tan","Got it. Thanks, Barry. Maybe just another one for you then on the MorphoSys' potential launch. Just what additional add to the infrastructure is needed there and where do you see points of synergies or components that can be leveraged from your existing network?","Barry Flannelly","Well, Andrea, as you know, until we close, we can't really plan together with our future partners at MorphoSys. So, we've been thinking about this a lot. And independently, we've been planning about what we actually need, but the ability to guide \u2013 now, on the other hand, we certainly have a great deal of experience in hem malignancies, certainly here in Wilmington, Delaware and throughout the United States. So, we're very confident that we know the space, the lymphoma space very well. We just have to take time, wait a couple of more weeks to actually get together and sit down with our partners on MorphoSys about the real details that we can do.","Andrea Tan","Got it. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is coming from Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is alive.","Alethia Young ","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on all the progress. One, can you just talk a little bit about the status of the CITADEL program and when we could expect data there? ","And then, basically, kind of your thoughts and your increased conviction \u2013 and I saw some data, obviously, from parsaclisib and ruxolitinib, but just maybe talk a little bit about your increased conviction in that combo and then also the other kind of combos in the LIMBER program as well. Thank you.","Steven Stein","Alethia, it's Steven. Thanks for the question. So, the CITADEL program has three components in terms of B cell malignancies. There's a follicular lymphoma study, 203 CITADEL; a marginal zone lymphoma study, 204; and then, a mantle cell lymphoma study, 205. Essentially, we've completed recruitment across all those studies. There may be just a few patients left on one to be done. And now, we're in the follow-up phase. As we've presented this data multiple times because they're open label, single-arm studies, we're very encouraged by the high activity of parsaclisib across these B cell malignancies. And now, it's really a wait for the duration of response data. And then, they all could be potentially accelerated approval routes in the United States, given the designs of the study. And we may have to then go on and do confirmatory studies as well. ","So, we'll get the bulk of all of their data with a long follow-up through this calendar year and then look at potential submissions across the board. But we're very encouraged by that program and what we've done with it.","In terms of the myelofibrosis combinations, as we announced in our prepared remarks, the most advanced is the rux plus PI3 delta combination. We also presented that data a number of times. We now have the updated data set looking at the experiments we did in terms of weekly versus daily dosing. And we're most encouraged by the daily dosing arm of the proof-of-concept study, and that's why we'll be going forward this year in a pivotal registration route with that combination. We still have to work out the details with regulatory agencies, but the likely population, as we said in our prepared remarks, are patients who have been on rux, probably for approximately three months, but don't have a sufficient response and are then randomized to rux plus PI3 delta versus rux alone in some sort of registration fashion with sufficient numbers.","And given the effect we've seen from the addition of delta in that population to date where we saw further clean volume response, particularly with the daily arm, as well as symptom response, obviously, we're encouraged by going forward to a pivotal program there. ","In terms of the rest of the LIMBER program, it's also a big year as we announced at JP Morgan. We're beginning and we've resurrected our BET program based on the external environment and what's happening with BET inhibitors in myelofibrosis. So, we're a go with our own BET inhibitor this year. We'll do the monotherapy safety work and go as quickly as we can to combination with rux there. And then, our L2 to program as well, which is targeted around alleviating the anemia through a hepcidin mechanism in combination with rux and that'll also go to combination this year. And then, we'll get further proof-of-concept data for rux plus PIM inhibition. ","So, obviously, an extremely important development program to us, given the importance of rux in myeloproliferative neoplasms in general and an active year in terms of initiating a pivotal study, getting further proof-of-concept study and starting two new mechanisms.","Alethia Young ","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question is coming from Mara Goldstein from Mizuho. Your line is now alive.","Mara Goldstein","Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Just to circle back on the previous question on the rux plus parsaclisib in myelofibrosis. Can you characterize what that proof of concept was and also what is considered an insufficient response to rux in the clinical trial, but also in clinical practice today?","Steven Stein","Hey, Mara. Thanks your question. It's a good question because, as you look across not only us, but everybody else doing studies in this arena, you have to be very careful of doing cross study comparisons and make sure that you actually do an apple-to-apple comparisons, particularly in terms of how people define the population they study, in terms of the amount of prior rux exposure, what constituted either refractory or disease that's progressing and how much was allowed and then was rux actually discontinued versus was it continued. ","And the reason I mentioned the latter is just to be clear, is that if you discontinue rux and then allow patients to rebound, if you will, in terms of their spleen and symptoms, just reintroducing rux again you'll see quite a substantial effect. And we've documented that before and published that. So, you have to be very, very careful of the populations you're looking at.","Our proof-of-concept work from a definition point of view with rux plus PI3 delta was defined as patients who had been on at least six months of ruxolitinib for at least two months of stable dosing and then were showing insufficient response in terms of spleen or symptoms and then allowed to come on to the combination without discontinuing rux. With that, we showed a further detriment in terms of spleen volume reduction. That was better with daily dosing rather than weekly dosing. ","If you're asking the exact quantitative excursion in terms of spleen volume response, that's a good question. In the frontline setting, obviously, given our own approval in the setting, we have now established the endpoint of spleen volume reduction of 35% or greater done through a measurement like MRI, for example, which is not subjective as the probable end point that regulators will use going forward as well as validated symptom scores.","In the latter line setting, one could argue that that may be too high a bar to get to and maybe 20% or more improvement in spleen volume reduction with concurrent symptom improvement may get you across the finish line or other endpoints like transfusion independence. But that's sort of where the field is right now. I think for the moment, first line studies will still require spleen volume responses as a primary endpoint with symptoms as a secondary end point. And we've established with our own label what that bar is with the COMFORT studies and that's what people will have to use going forward. ","In the other settings, there may be somewhat more creative end points that you could do as long as you prove to regulators and patients that you're actually getting clinical benefit.","Mara Goldstein","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Christopher Marai from Nomura Instinet. Your line is now live.","Christopher Marai","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. I'm wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the vehicle performance in TRuE-AD that you saw. Just being cognizant that the Eucrisa Phase III saw some variability in that vehicle performance. How do you feel, I guess, given that type of variability about chance for success of TRuE-AD1? ","And maybe, if you could, just remind us of some of your coloring assumptions around that? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Chris, it's Steven. So, if you look at the atopic dermatitis arena in general, they're awesome vehicles that on their own, without \"active ingredient,\" will have a response rate because of the emollient effect of different vehicles that will then result in improvement in the underlying condition. ","Our vehicle is cream based, just like our actual active product. And you saw in the proof-of-concept 150-patient study, our vehicle response rate was 10% or less percentage point. Just to give you by way of comparison a number, but not to make a direct comparison, Eucrisa in their registration studies had to use an ointment-based vehicle because of their constitution of their active product. And their ointment-based vehicle response rate was north of 20%. ","So, we don't expect \u2013 and that's why, earlier when we spoke, we said our results are consistent with our proof-of-concept data to date directionally and quantitatively. We expect the same vehicle cream response rate in our TRuE-AD1 and TRuE-AD2 studies that we saw in our proof-of-concept work. And that's where we stand right now. Obviously, we want to share this with you as soon as we can in an appropriate meeting.","Christopher Marai","Thank you. I appreciate that. And just one last on ruxo guidance. How much GVHD acute or chronic is sort of in those numbers? Thanks.","Steven Stein","I'm sorry, could you repeat the question. I didn't repeat the question.","Christopher Marai","In terms of your rux guidance for the year, how much of that, if any, accounts for use in GVHD? Thank you.","Barry Flannelly","Well, we were hoping for a particular number of patients. I think I said before that there is 3,000 patients total, so refractory GVHD, acute GVHD is about 1,500 patients. We think we are approaching about 1,000 patients \u2013 it's hard to actually for GVHD because the drug oftentimes is given in a hospital and we don't get as much detail as you do when you get a prescription on the outside. So, GVHD is an important part of the guidance for this year. But, overwhelmingly, it's the continued growth in myelofibrosis which is really going very well and the continued growth for patients with polycythemia vera, again, which is continuing \u2013 going very well. But Jakafi in acute steroid-refractory GVHD is becoming one of the most used, if not most used drug, other than steroids in treatment of these patients.","Christopher Marai","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over for any further or closing comments.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Incyte. Please go ahead, Mike.","Mike Booth","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the investors section of incyte.com. I am joined on the call today by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Steven and Christiana Stamoulis, who will deliver our prepared remarks. And by Dash who will join us for the Q&A session.","Before we begin however, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2019 guidance, the commercialization of our products and the development plans for the compounds in our pipeline, as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2018, and from time to time, in our other SEC documents.","We'll now begin the call with Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. So we have excellent progress in the first quarter of 2019. Net product revenues of Jakavi continued to be strong, delivering 20% growth over the first quarter of last year and last week, Novartis reported strong sales of Jakavi, ex-US, also up 20% on a constant currency basis with continued double digit growth across all operators.","Including Jakavi and Olumiant royalties, sales of Iclusig and the milestones from Innovent, we reported total revenue of 498 million, up 30% compared to Q1 last year. On the right side of slide 4, you will see some of the important progress from across our development portfolio. Our GVHD development work is on track and we recently completed recruitment in to the GRAVITAS-301 trial we tested in patient with treatment naive acute GVHD and we plan to announce the plan result from this trial before the end of 2019.","We are also on track to submit the NDA seeking approval of Pemigatinib in cholangiocarcinoma in the second half of 2019. And we expect that the data supporting the NDA will be presented at the medical meeting in the second half of the year. This morning, we announced the successful completion of the phase 2 trial of Ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo patients, which represents a robust proof of concept in a second indication beyond atopic dermatitis, where we are already in phase 3. Based on the phase 2 results for Ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo, we are also moving forward with phase 3 developments in this indication and we look forward to sharing this data with you at the medical meeting in the coming weeks.","Novartis continues to plan for the NDA submission for Capmatinib in the second half of the year and updated data from the GEOMETRY trial have been accepted for oral presentation at this year\u2019s ASCO in June. Exciting data from two of our early stage projects were presented at AACR earlier in April, the presentations of our oral PD-L1 inhibitor program as well as a PD-L1xCD137 bi-specific, we\u2019re developing in collaboration with Myers were very well received and I believe that unlimited of the importance of discovery science for long term value creation.","Today, we also announced that we will no longer participate in co-founding pathogen development with Lilly. We intend to make a reallocation of this capital to late stage development program during 2019 and 2020, as we now believe that certain projects such as the acceleration and expansion of Ruxolitinib cream development and the acceleration of our opportunities in our later stage portfolio won\u2019t increase funding. We continue to believe that pathogen has an impact place in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and potentially in other autoimmune and inflammatory conditions. But with our cumulative investment already earning us a substantial royalty rate, we believe that now is the right time to opt out and to reallocate capital to support exciting project to help us reach our strategic goals of diversification and growth.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Barry for an update on the US business.","Barry Flannelly","Thank you, Herv\u00e9 and good morning, everyone. Jakavi continues to perform well and Q1 performance was in line with our expectations and with full year 2019 guidance for net sales of $1.58 billion to $1.65 billion. Jakavi\u2019s sales increased by 20% over Q1 of last year, driven by demand in both approved indications. We saw total MS and total PD patients grow by 8% and 18% respectively in the first quarter, versus the same period in 2018. ","Slide 7 shows the sales bridge for Q1 2018 to Q1 2019. The growth of Jakavi was mostly driven by volume. And you can see that amounted to an increase of $42 million compared to Q1 of last year. You'll remember that the negative effect on gross to net is highest in Q1. It is also important to note that drug manufacturers are now required to contribute 70% of the coverage gap or donut hole as compared to 50% in previous years.","I'll finish by reminding you of the May 24 PDUFA date on our SNDA for Ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute GVHD and that we are ready to launch immediately should the FDA approve Ruxolitinib in this indication. Our field force has already been sized and structured to support the launch. Our REACH development program also continues as planned. The results from both REACH 2 and REACH 3, the global phase 3 trials of Ruxolitinib which we're running in collaboration with Novartis in steroid refractory acute and chronic GVHD are expected by the end of this year.","I'll now turn the call over to Steven for the clinical update.","Steven Stein","Thanks, Barry, and good morning everyone. Incyte is currently running six key late stage development programs, as summarized on slide 10. These have the potential to treat a significant number of patients across numerous indications. More broadly speaking, these programs aim to transform Incyte into a company with multiple approved products in the United States, Europe, and Japan over the next several years.","Today, we are focusing our attention on four of them, as these are the projects that we expect to generate important updates during 2019. Barry has already highlighted our ruxolitinib program in steroid refractory graft versus host disease. And I will touch on the remaining three in my remarks.","We are pleased to announce today that the phase 2 trial of ruxolitinib cream in patients with Vitiligo successfully reached its primary endpoint, and that the plans for phase 3 development are now underway. This was a randomized dose ranging and vehicle control phase 2 trial in more than 150 adults with Vitiligo, and we look forward to sharing the data with you at a medical meeting soon.","Vitiligo is an inflammatory disease of the skin, which results in patches of de-pigmentation and the potential for significant impact on patient\u2019s lives. It is estimated that there are 2 million to 3 million patients in the United States with this disorder and there are no currently approved FDA treatments. Many patients try steroids or phototherapy. But these options have not shown significant or long lasting re-pigmentation of the skin. We expect to initiate phase 3 development by the end of this year. And we are hopeful that ruxolitinib cream will be the first therapy approved by the FDA and will provide these patients with a meaningful improvement in their disease.","We believe that there are significant opportunities within our pemigatinib program. We expect to file the NDA for second line FGFR2 translocated cholangiocarcinoma in the second half of this year. And we are also planning to share the data that supports the proposed NDA at a medical meeting in the second half of 2019. The second indication we are pursuing for pemigatinib is FGFR3 mutated bladder cancer. And we are currently recruiting the continuous dosing cohort of the pivotal phase 2 trial. We expect that this cohort will reach full recruitment by the end of this year and we are hopeful that the SNDA for this indication could be submitted in 2020.","The first line phase 3 trial in cholangiocarcinoma is now open for recruitment and plans for first line bladder cancer study are also in preparation. We are also opening a registration directed phase 2 study in a tumor agnostic setting, which could further expand the number of patients eligible for the therapy and therefore the potential of the molecule.","Moving back to our development efforts in graft versus host disease, and the GRAVITAS program, which is investigating itacitinib in first line treatment. GRAVITAS-301, a phase 3 trial in treatment naive acute graft versus host disease has now completed recruitment. And we expect results to be available before the end of this year. In January, we launched GRAVITAS-309, which will evaluate itacitinib in patients with treatment naive, chronic graft versus host disease. It is important to note that in major markets globally, approximately 15,000 new graft versus host disease patients are diagnosed each year. The unmet need here is clear and we are encouraged by the potential of JAK ambition to treat this often deadly disease.","I\u2019ll end my update by mentioning two very exciting opportunities in our early stage portfolio, both of which were recently highlighted at AACR. We have discovered a series of novel, orally available PD-L1 inhibitors, and the first molecule 86550 is now in the clinic. Its mechanism of action, which binds, [indiscernible] and internalizes PD-L1 is novel and could result in a differentiated clinical profile versus injectable monoclonal antibodies. We are in the early innings, but we look forward to sharing clinical data for this program next year.","Through our collaboration with Merus, MCLA-145, a PD-L1, CD137 bi-specific antibody is ready to enter clinical development and we expect to have the first patient dosed with MCLA-145 this quarter. This is also a very exciting mechanism with the bi-specific direct CD137 agonist activity to the tumor micro-environment by its selectivity for PD-L1. This may limit systemic CD137 agonist activation, while targeting two important immune moderate pathways.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to Christiana for financial update.","Christiana Stamoulis","Thanks, Steven and good morning, everyone. The financial update this morning will include GAAP and non-GAAP numbers. Before moving to our results for the quarter, I would like to discuss a change in our methodology for non-GAAP reconciliation. After reviewing our non-GAAP reconciliation and at the request of the SEC, beginning with the first quarter of 2019, we will no longer be adjusting our revenues or research and development expense for upfront consideration and milestones that are part of our collaboration agreements with new or existing partners. This new methodology is reflected in the GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation on slides 25 and 26 in the backup section of the deck, and in the press release that we issued this morning,","In addition, I\u2019d like to further discuss our decision to end the additional co-funding of baricitinib development with Lilly. As you know, under our agreement with Lilly, we have the right to base their royalty of 11% to 20% on global net sales of Olumiant. We also have the right to receive a 9% incremental royalty if we could fund 30% of the post BOC development costs per baricitinib indication. Based on the cumulative investment made to date, we have already earned a substantial incremental royalty rate, especially in rheumatoid arthritis and have now reached the point, given the acceleration and potential of certain key internal projects, where we believe that the best decision is to add additional co-funding of baricitinib development and reallocate capital over the balance of 2019 and in 2020 to other projects.","Through 2018, we were entitled to receive the full 9% incremental royalty in addition to the 11% to 20% base their royalty. With our decision to end our co-funding effective at the end of 2018, we expect the incremental royalty rate for rheumatoid arthritis to come down over time. The timing and the rate of decline in the incremental royalty rate will be based on Lilly\u2019s additional development costs in this indication, and the pace at which those costs are incurred. The base royalty rate isn\u2019t affected by levels of development spend, and as it is a key royalty structure, it is expected to grow over time as global net sales of Olumiant continue to grow. ","Moving on to our financial results. For the first quarter, we recorded $458 million of total product related revenues, an increase of 20% over the first quarter of 2018. This is comprised of $376 million in Jakavi and $21 million in Iclusig net product revenues, $46 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis and $16 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly. We also recognized $40 million in contract revenues from the upfront payment we received under our collaboration agreement with Innovent, resulting in total revenues for the quarter of $498 million.","R&D expense for the quarter was $243 million on a non GAAP basis, driven by the progress across our development programs, as Steven has outlined. And in this quarter versus last year, this expense was partially offset by the impact of our decision to stop co-funding baricitinib development and lower costs related to the applicator set program. The net effect was a 9% decrease in ongoing R&D expense for the quarter compared to the prior year period. ","SG&A expense for the quarter was $111 million on a non-GAAP basis, relatively flat in comparison with the prior year. The increase in total revenues and decline in non-GAAP costs and expenses has resulted in operating income for the quarter of $127 million on a non-GAAP basis as compared to an operating loss of $19 million in the prior year period.","Moving now to our guidance for 2019, we are re-iterating our revenue guidance for the full year as well as our SG&A guidance. We have received our GAAP -- we have revised our GAAP R&D guidance from a range of $1.185 billion to $1.255 billion to a range of $1.145 billion to $1.195 billion, which largely reflects our decision to discontinue co-funding baricitinib development and the timing of resource reallocation. Please note that this guidance does not include any additional potential future strategic transactions beyond agreements previously announced.","I will now turn the call back to Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Christiana. Our next slide outlines the key newsflow events we expect during 2019, including news from our partner. With this list of exciting late stage program, we are taking important steps throughout our strategic goals of diversifying and accelerating revenue growth. We look forward to keeping you updated on our program. And for now, we are happy to take your questions. Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Marc Frahm from Cowen and Company.","Marc Frahm","Maybe first just a kind of housekeeping one for Barry. Can you disclose the gross to net in the quarter? Just how it worked out with the new rules around the donut hole and do you still think the full year is going to be about 15%.","Barry Flannelly","Yes, the full year gross to net is going to be about 15%. The gross to net, as you know, is highest in the first quarter, the additional 20%. So going from 50% of the donut hole to 70% of the donut hole amounted to about $5 million we estimate.","Marc Frahm","Okay, thank you. And maybe just turning to the topical ruxolitinib, so for Steven, one, so that there's a new maximum use trial that's on clinical trials like, is there anything else that needs to be done other than reading out that and reading out obviously the phase 3 data in atopic dermatitis for filing? And then maybe initial thoughts on the design for phase 3 trial in Vitiligo, does it need to be as large as atopic dermatitis or can you leverage a lot of the safety data?","Steven Stein","Marc, it\u2019s Steven. Thanks for your questions. So, for atopic dermatitis for the entirety of the filing package, there will be nothing additional that needs to be done other than obviously completing both phase 3s. And the maximal use study that's done per the guidance for dermatological products. And that, we have high confidence in atopic dermatitis data based on our very strong proof of concept with the cream. ","In terms of Vitiligo, obviously, we've just delivered the proof of concept data. We\u2019re very, very encouraged by, it'll be presented at a medical meeting soon, obviously been thinking about the Phase 3 designs all along and have relatively well developed concepts, which we\u2019re now at an end of phase 2 meeting with the FDA, discuss with them and come to decisions on the endpoints and the size. And as we said, our intent is to start those before the end of the year.","In terms of what I think you're alluding to, will the safety package be able to be leveraged from atopic dermatitis for Vitiligo? We expect that would be the case, but there will be a discussion point with the regulatory authorities. Having said that, the Vitiligo studies will still have to be appreciable in size, it's a different area from oncology and you require larger studies, but we expect that the safety package from atopic dermatitis will be very helpful for the Vitiligo file.","Marc Frahm","Okay, great. And then maybe a bigger picture for Herv\u00e9, in the past, with these mid-stage dermatology projects, you mentioned that you'd have a decision to make ultimately about whether it's right for Incyte to market them and build a whole commercial infrastructure in that space, versus ultimately partnering these out. Now that you kind of have randomized data in house, at least in two indications, are you ready to make that decision? Do you have an answer on that?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","So, obviously, you know, our approach was, in terms of commercialization, was driven by cancer portfolio and we decided to commercialize ourselves in North America, Europe and Japan. That was like two years ago, three years ago, four years ago, we have built that infrastructure now. So we have a new question here is, does this apply to dermatology? And the answer is, it's very different in terms of size of the opportunities by -- for each of the regions, so we are looking at it on a regional basis. And from that first review, what we see is that there is a lot of attractiveness to doing it ourselves in the US. ","There is certainly less of that for Japan, where it's a complicated and different market from what we see in cancer. And we are basically reviewing also for Europe, what would be the best approach and it could be either to commercialize alone fully or to find a co-commercialization partner and book the revenue or to out license completely and book milestones and royalties. ","And frankly, we are looking at each of the three opportunities, and what will make the most sense from the Incyte standpoint financially and in terms of investment and risk. So it's quality upon, we have time because of phase 3 results from atopic dermatitis are anticipated at the beginning of \u2013 in 2020. So we are planning to use the next six months to have an in depth analysis of what makes sense with our board. And we will probably be already by the time we get the phase 3 data. And after the phase 3, there will be another year before the commercialization is starting. So we are basically on a good track to be able to make the decision based on valuation or financial analysis.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Michael Schmidt from Guggenheim.","Michael Schmidt","I had a couple on pemigatinib, specifically regarding bladder cancer, can you just help us frame the opportunity here in context of some news recently around, approval of erdafitinib from J&J and DCL Genetics, top line data as well. How do you think about the opportunity here and help us understand if there will be any updates from your phase 2 study in bladder cancer this year? And then the other question was regarding Jakafi, I guess what was the gross to net in the first quarter, how should we think about that in the second half of the year. ","Steven Stein","It\u2019s Steven and Barry will answer your gross to net question. So, as I said in my prepared remarks, this is the second indication we\u2019re pursuing, obviously, a very important indication and quantitatively bigger than FGFR4 translocated cholangiocarcinoma, this is the FGFR3 mutated or fusion patients with bladder cancer and the opportunity is large in the 15,000 to 20,000 patient range. We view the J&J erdafitinib approval very positively. It's -- it gives us proof of concept that the pathway is important that hitting the striving mutation is effective, we're always ahead, although we have caught up substantially, we do in our continuous dosing. ","Now, we expect to complete that continuous dosing cohort around the third quarter of this year, but you\u2019re only likely to see data from us next year in 2020 and in addition, that's where we'll be filing as well, should the data be supportive of filing. The Seattle conjugated monoclonal is a different target, probably, in some respects, mutually exclusive and, potentially important drug in bladder cancer as well. So it doesn't affect anything in terms of our program at all. ","And then obviously, we have the ongoing MPN 8P11 FGFR1 driven study that's actually accruing very well after ASH update. And then very importantly, the tumor agnostic program, which substantially expands the potential population in areas like endometrial cancer, glioblastoma, et cetera. This could be upwards of another 15,000 patients, if we deliver efficacy in all these populations. So, as you outlined, extremely important program to us, that's going very well, we view that approval, that's important proof of concept for the pathway. We think the safety may ultimately be something that's important. We note the J&J label, and we'll see what our data shows in terms of safety down the pipe.","I\u2019ll turn it over to Barry for your gross to net question.","Barry Flannelly","Yeah. Michael, so the gross to net, we estimate for the first quarter, full first quarter at 17%. I was going to imagine, it's much higher in January and then settles down in February and March. And generally speaking, gets a little bit better each subsequent quarter after that, and as I said before, for the full year, we estimate the gross to net to be 15%.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC.","Brian Abrahams","What's the right way to think about the cost savings from the bari restructuring? I guess for this year and beyond, once we net out the effect of some of those accounting changes, for provoking milestones and how are you guys thinking specifically about allocating that funding? Will that be for new projects, new indications for some of the late stage programs, moving other early stage pipeline programs forward into the late stage, what\u2019s the right way to think about that?","Christiana Stamoulis","Hi, Brian. This is Christiana. So in terms of baricitinib, first of all, the revised guidance that we provided implies a 40% to 60%, sorry $40 million to $60 million reduction in R&D spend in 2019. That, as we indicated, includes the decision to opt out from baricitinib development and the partial reallocation in 2019 on some of the funds that we had earmarked for baricitinib to other internal programs. Also as we indicated, the decision to opt out was really driven by the opportunity that we see in some late stage programs and the desire to accelerate or augment the development of those programs like rux cream. So in 2019 through the rest of 2019 and in 2020, we would be looking to reallocate the capital that otherwise would have been allocated to baricitinib to those late stage programs.","Brian Abrahams","Got it. And then one more question for me, what's the right way to be thinking about the bar for clinical meaningfulness in the Vitiligo setting and the potential readthroughs between Vitiligo and atopic dermatitis pathophysiologically, do you view this as sort of an additional endorsement of the potential for rux cream in atopic derm beyond the phase 2 you've already reported in AD or should we think about this as very -- as completely separate from a scientific standpoint.","Steven Stein","It\u2019s Steven. Thanks for your question. In terms of the, what is clinically meaningful in Vitiligo, obviously, there's no approved therapies and there's actually being a dearth of clinical work to date. This is the biggest study done, ever in Vitiligo. The primary endpoint in this proof of concept study was the percentage of patients treated with ruxolitinib cream to achieve a 50% or greater improvement in the facial assessment of the Vitiligo area and severity index scored, called score compared to vehicle and that measures the activity of the compound. ","In addition as we've said and as the field keeps telling us, this is a disease with a large psychosocial burden on patients and we'll be measuring that through appropriate patient reported outcomes during the study because we would have to document clinical benefit in that respect. The big caveat, as we need to discuss with the agency what the primary endpoint will be for the Phase 3 studies, will it be a vacy [ph], will it be a face vacy, will it be a total body vacy and to what degree will they accept as the primary endpoint in addition to measuring patient reported outcomes. ","It's 150 patient study, you'll see the data at a major meeting in the middle of this year. And obviously, we're very encouraged by are we going to face 3. The read through for me is, in terms of inhibiting interferon gamma signaling in Vitiligo, stopping this [indiscernible] and then getting the re-pigmentation in important areas to patients like the face and hand and hands which are visible externally. And it\u2019s a similar mechanism to AD, but I don't -- they are just separate indications that we pursue separately. There are potentially other diseases over the years, we've looked at like psoriasis, which have some overlap in terms of pathophysiology, but the current program in terms of registration direction is towards atopic dermatitis and Vitiligo.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Carter Gould from UBS.","Carter Gould","Just wanted to, I guess, dig in a little bit more into the decision to stop the co-funding. You gave some rationale for that, but I guess you've been pretty persistent on this front that you would keep up that effort, I know you get -- conducted multiple internal analyses, so I guess sort of what changed and if there was any sort of shift either in kind of how you guys were viewing, maybe the systemic market for AD or specifically you mentioned some of the other assets in your pipeline, anything specifically you would call out.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Maybe I can start and Christiana can complement it. I think it's important to realize that this decision is not about the way we see the future of baricitinib, it's about 2 other things. One is, the way the additional royalty rate is calculated is based on the cumulative investments that we have already made in baricitinib, so you can imagine that the return on the marginal investment that we make is always lower than the return on the previous investments, so there is a point that we believe we have reached where in fact we see that there is a better return on that investment in our internal project as we have seen a number of them that requires or give us the opportunity to accelerate and expand like we discussed about itacitinib, pemigatinib and ruxolitinib cream. ","So we came to that conclusion that in term of marginal investment that we make in R&D, it would be a better allocation to do it to our internal programs that have been progressing very well and are very promising, so that's really how we came to that conclusion. As you know, we have told you regularly that we are reviewing over the time every quarter, we are reviewing the way R&D resources are allocated and that's the, basically the time came where it made sense for us to reallocate these resources to internal programs.","Carter Gould","And if I could just ask a follow up, appreciate all the color Herv\u00e9, just in terms of, I guess, there has been sort of increased talk around you guys potentially be an acquirer in the marketplace and just in terms of your capacity for M&A based on your current cash position and future cash flows kind of how you're viewing that.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","I mean what we are looking at is really the two strategic goals to our growth and diversification. So growing our revenue, which is obviously translating into the P&L and going through the bottom line in some way, but growth is important and diversification is important. So that's why there is always this possibility for us to do some business development that will add to our top line over the next the next year. It's clear that we have, I think at the end of the quarter, the cash position is 1.6 billion. The P&L structure that you can see this quarter, it\u2019s very strong in term of cash flow and that gives us more ammunition for potential business development opportunities. At the same time, our internal portfolio is also very strong and progressing very well, so we are basically looking at both as potential ways to get to our strategic objectives.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs.","Salveen Richter","For Vitiligo, in terms of the commercial opportunity, are the 2 million to 3 million patients in the US all targets and where should we expect that data set in 2Q?","Steven Stein","It\u2019s Steven Stein. So the incidence is around 1%, so 1% to 2%, if you have a 300 million population, that's how many total patients there are and it's just -- that's just the potential opportunity. The amount to seek treatment currently is much, much smaller, it's around 150,000 patients we can best estimate who actually currently seek treatment. That could be for multiple reasons as you well know in terms of a lack of available therapy, the fact that therapies that are available are somewhat cumbersome hard to give and require high compliance in terms of steroids and phototherapy and also for patients who just don't feel they need treatment. ","So, the population that is ultimately targeted will be for the ones that feel they have to treat areas that are causing the visual disfigurement plus the psychosocial implications of the disease. Obviously, we will have to demonstrate the efficacy benefit in the areas that are concerning, particularly as I said earlier, the ones that are visible externally like face and hands and we are not that population that ultimately will need, treatment from us could be in the range of 150,000 or so. It's hard to estimate currently.","Salveen Richter","Thanks. And just a housekeeping follow up, where did Jakafi inventory levels stand, exiting the quarter.","Barry Flannelly","So, this is Barry. Actually, their normal levels are below three weeks.","Operator","Your next question is coming from Alethia Young from Cantor Fitzgerald.","Alethia Young","Two for me actually. One, I know the PI3 kinase program doesn't get a lot of love. But, I think there are some PI3 kinase just coming back on the scene, including yours with data. So I just wanted you to talk a little about how you\u2019re seeing your current molecule may be differentiated from others.","And then my second question, and maybe it's asking the question another way, obviously, you guys have a core JAK capability. And I'm just kind of wondering how long it would take for you guys to kind of generate a return on invested capital, if you were to invest in dermatology? It seems like there's a lot you could do internally in the pipeline that you have, and obviously you have the top of the programs with your ongoing thing.","Steven Stein","So, it\u2019s Steven, I'll do your first question. So, the reason I think we [indiscernible] this is the year of enrolling the studies that are registration directed in follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and marginal zone lymphoma and the Rolodex is really going well this year, it'll complete and then we'll have data next year. And hopefully be again of submission quality in those indications. This is a second generation PI3 kinase inhibitor. The chemical changes that were done to this generation of compounds seem to have dialed out the liver toxicity for the most part. ","So you don't see the transaminitis that you used to see for the first generation compounds like listed from Gilead initially. But what is the concern with this degree of PI3-kinase inhibition, over the long term, our safety concerns like colitis, so we made a very conscious decision in a little over a year ago, to try and thread that therapeutic benefit more cleverly, we know the compound is highly active, it's incredibly active in B cell disease, as we've shown that data repeatedly. ","But to get that activity at the same time, to make it more tolerable is to look at different ways of doing dosing and scheduling. So, we do the high dose up front, 20 milligrams weekly for the eight weeks to get to the efficacy bar we want. And then we look to different ways of either weekly or daily dosing at lower doses. And it looks like early days that we've been able to dial out with many caveats because the small numbers, a lot of the longer term toxicity that colitis, so that's a pretty exciting place to be from a therapeutic benefit point of view. ","And now we\u2019re executing those studies to a substantial numbers of patients in marginal mantle and follicular to see if it's true, what we say. So have the high activity and much more tolerable profile. And then filing those indications, all of those indications remain to date as not curable diseases. So despite there being BTK inhibitors, B cell 2 inhibitors, CART therapies, there's still a lot of unmet need in these entities. And that's why we\u2019re very encouraged by this program.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","I speak about the ROI in dermatology. As I said, I mean, it's an open seat for us. So we are looking at it and making decisions based on what seems to be aligned with our goals of diversification and growth. And that's important to look that this dermatology has fairly high potential indications for Incyte. When you look at the number of patients on both at the big derm and Vitiligo, if you look at the therapeutic profile that we get from a topical administration, where the risk benefit and the side effects that you can observe, have a very different rate than what you have with systemic treatment. We believe there is a real opportunity that could be very meaningful for Incyte in both indications. ","That being said, as we discussed, we are looking at the commercial cost of having infrastructure for dermatology. It looks like specialty dermatology products in the US do not require an enormous size the type of team, so that one seems to be leaning in the direction where we would be doing it ourselves. And as I said, in Japan and Europe and the rest of the world, it's a plan and we will see what makes the most sense and ROI is certainly a very important criteria and the speed at which we can show cash flow positivity coming from the dermatology franchise, if you look at it that way, is very important. At the same time, being able to book the revenue and to diversify the top line is also very important. So that's the two criteria we will be looking at to make that decision.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan Chase.","Cory Kasimov","I have just a couple of earlier stage clinical ones for you. So, first of all, the phase 2 tumor agnostic study for pemigatinib, is three an agreement with regulators or any sort of minimum number of different tumor types you need to enroll in that program.","Steven Stein","It\u2019s Steven. So the precedent for it comes from both what other companies have done before in the setting. Plus, in an FDA opinion piece that was written recently around, this is a reasonable approach when you already have a drug that's approved in at least one or two indications that the pathway is validated in this case, if you're far inhibition, and you can look at areas like MSI high for the checkpoint inhibitors as sort of a proof of principle, if you will, for doing a study this way. So we don't have and we won't be obtaining strict regulatory approval for the exact numbers required each time. But what you want to see is in a particular disease, like say, endometrial or glioblastoma, something where, you have the selection for the particular FGFR mutation of fusion, a very high degree of activity that's robust and durable. In the setting, we already have approvals elsewhere in a validated pathway. And that's the idea behind it. And as I said, there's regulatory precedent already.","Cory Kasimov","And then for the second question, curious about your clinical plans for MCLA 145. Can you talk about the overall strategy there with the initial trials and how enriched those phase 1 studies will be?","Steven Stein","I think it's best to say we\u2019re working in collaboration with Merus here, it's early days. As I said in my prepared remarks, it's a very interesting bispecific paradigm here. There's been precedent before with mono use of CD137 and unfortunately, quite a lot of toxicity in terms of liver toxicity and transaminitis. So the idea here is to direct it with a bispecific via the PD-L1 enrichment straight to the area where it\u2019s needed and try and subvert that toxicity and we'll see. Right. ","The second thing is, should these both mechanisms work together, as we expect from theoretic and our preclinical data, we think there will be potential plans for areas where sort of checkpoint refractory patients exists in that, but that's something we'll have to prove to you. I think it's too early just to talk about, because we\u2019re only about to start dosing in a way that will have a lot of activity data early on, we're not enriching early on for any particular to answer your question directly, receptor or biomarkers, it\u2019s more standard phase 1 first time in man, just to get to a safe -- the safety principle first.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Christopher Marai from Nomura Instinet.","Christopher Marai","Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the questions. I'm just wondering if you could elaborate perhaps on the opportunity for topical rux in atopic derm. Would you be looking at expanding a label, perhaps to the pediatric setting?","And then secondarily, with respect to the clean formulation, I Recall previously, there was a rather breezy formulation that you've been using. And this may have been a problem until ago, I was wondering, have you -- remind me, have you updated or modified that formulation to make it a little bit more patient friendly?","And then secondarily, how does this cream differ from the ointment formulation used for Eucrisa? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Christopher, it\u2019s Steven. So it's good to bring up the pediatric part of the population here. So, the studies that we\u2019re doing currently and we have permission to do from the regulators are in 12 years and above, in mild to moderate atopic dermatitis, which covers the majority of the population. In terms of the population below 12, so 2 to 12 years of age, that's something we\u2019re still working on the regulators with things like safety margins, et cetera. And it\u2019s something we will be interested in down the pipe, but the program at the moment is 12 years and above and that covers the vast majority of patients who are interested in treating with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. ","In terms of the formulation question, we have not changed it. It's a cream. It's in terms of the data we have and we've used it extensively, if you just heard in atopic derm already in Vitiligo, it's been very well received. There's no greasiness, no burning, no stinging. When you allude to you, Chris, one of the things we've been told and we've seen from real world data is that seems to be the problem with that particular agent and that it induces both burning and stinging, and then maybe why it\u2019s not used as wide as people wanted to be used. But we haven't had that at all a problem with our formulation to date, and we don't expect it to be, given that we've already treated hundreds of patients.","Christopher Marai","Okay, thank you. And then with respect to perhaps the moderate to severe setting for atopic derm, have you started or do you have any plans to explore the topical formulation there, given, of course, also the potential for the safety concerns or perhaps better efficacy there?","Steven Stein","Yes. So our program is mild to moderate. The moderate to severe is particularly more on the severe range have been reserved for oral therapies. And as you know, baricitinib has a program there and others and then other targets that maybe have a different safety margin and are more acceptable for severe, that's not a population we targeted. There is some overlap in terms of the moderates. And we are expecting the clinical data will dictate how physicians and patients then use the therapies there in terms of degree of disease they have and what they\u2019re trying to achieve in terms of the clinical results. One very important endpoint we saw, which was a good surprise was relief of itch with our product was dramatic and occurred very, very quickly within two days. And that's something that really is important to patients. And so we think, if that's a particular goal of physicians and patients, and we document that in our clinical trials, that will be an important endpoint. But for the most part, we don't think there's overlap. And again, we target in mild to moderates only with the cream.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Barclays.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Jason on for Geoff. Just real quickly on Jakafi, if you could give us a sense of your expectations for the mix of price and volume moving forward, especially considering the gross to net hit in first quarter. And then I have a quick follow up.","Barry Flannelly","It\u2019s Barry. We continue to grow volume mostly. And as you can see from this quarter, in fact, or this year, Q1 2019 over Q1 2018, most of our growth, in terms of net sales, was for volume, and we see that continuing in the future.","Unidentified Analyst","And in terms of duration of therapy, and in terms of moving up earlier up line, is that factoring in as well? Or do you expect to see that more kind of as a longer term influence.","Barry Flannelly","We always tried to improve duration of therapy, we want patients to stay on as long as they continue to benefit from Jakafi. And that's true in both PD and MS. When we talk about duration of therapy, we really go back to the clinical trials and we look at the trials for example, where at least 50% of the patients were still on it three years. And at the five year follow-up of the response, you had 66% of patients still on therapy at five years. So, the duration of therapy, we always want to try to improve on and work together with our healthcare professionals. So they suggest those down based on increased efficacy or decreased toxicity. And, again, we want them to stay on therapy as long as they continue to benefit from it.","Unidentified Analyst","And then with regards to REACH 1, now that we're in the homestretch here and can \u2013 to the extent that you can, can you provide some color on how those discussions with FDA are moving and kind of what are your expectations for read through to REACH2 and REACH3 when we get to that point?","Steven Stein","Jason, it's Steven. So you're right, the PDUFA data, as Barry said, is May 24. We\u2019re still extremely confident in our data and we look forward to the PDUFA date, we don't give granular details on back and forth discussions with the FDA. But we are in a place where we're confident in our data and look forward to the PDUFA date. Of course, because of what I just said, we expect the read through to reach 2, which is the same population, steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease to be similarly positive. It's a randomized study against best available therapy. And then in terms of chronic graft versus host disease, REACH3 against randomized against BAT, we have strong proof of concept in that area. And we will have data by the end of this year in both REACH2 and REACH3 and similarly confident in it and wait for the data.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Tyler Van Buren from Piper Jaffray.","Tyler Van Buren","Thanks for the updates and the reallocation of baricitinib funding makes a ton of sense. I guess the, my question is related to the long term Jakafi guidance that you guys provided in February of last year of 2.5 billion to 3 billion by 2027. Are you guys -- can you reiterate your confidence in that, based upon what you're seeing in MF and PV and the development, GVHD programs, and also with respect to ET, how should we think about that program that's ongoing and when that indication could come to market?","Barry Flannelly","So yes, we're fully confident in 2.5 billion to 3 billion and that as we've said before, includes MF, PV and GVHD indications, we really didn't estimate for ET, we're fully confident we have almost 10 years actually left on the patent and you can see the growth year-over-year and the contribution that we give to the top line, I think we can make it there. I don't know if Steven wants to comment on ET.","Steven Stein","Obviously, that's the remaining [indiscernible] that\u2019s not BCR able driven. And because of the pathophysiology, again, every expectation that JAK inhibition should work there and we know we have some spontaneous use there. The issue with the study there is, it's very difficult to enroll. Dominant first line use is hydroxyurea and the study required as you can see on clinicaltrials.gov, for patients, to have high white blood cell counts at initiation of the study and then to be randomized to the approved therapy for central thrombocytopenia, which is a negative light. So both the high white count and the negative non randomization is to continue to make this study difficult to accrue and we will continue to examine ways to try and improve that recruitment. It may end up being an entity that we end up doing a publication on -- before completing the entire recruitment, but an important disease for JAK inhibition and obviously one we're trying to address with a formal study.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Unidentified Analyst","This is Alec on for Ying. Thanks for taking our questions. I guess I just have one on the differences between the various REACH studies. You alluded to this the FDA for Jakafi and steroid refractory, acute GVHD was based on the single arm REACH1 study? And do you see any risks in REACH2 and 3, comparing Jakafi, the best available therapy in terms of superiority, since some patients do actually respond to be at the and where the study is towered with this in mind?","Steven Stein","It\u2019s Steven again. Obviously, whenever you conduct a study, there's risk attached in that, you may have a negative outcome. And as you allude to the fact that best available therapies, and there's a different list for REACH2 and REACH3, or active therapies and can have upwards of 30%, 40% response rate, they tend though not to be durable. And so we have confident in the data we've seen to date in our proof of concept work, that we can differentiate both in terms of the upfront activity, and then the durability of response, but the outcome will be on how the studies report out. And obviously, there's always some risk with randomized studies.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer and Company.","Jay Olson","I was curious if there was any update on Jakafi lifecycle management. I know in the past, you've talked about extended release formulations and potential fix to those combinations. So, any update there will be great. Thank you.","Steven Stein","Hi. It's Steven again. Yeah. As Barry said, despite there being 10 approximate years of patent life left, it's an extremely important compound to us with a very large team working on active lifecycle management. Currently, there are three pillars to that. The formulation side, as you alluded to, and we've already published data with one stint of ruxolitinib, XR, and we busy developing other stints to go forward in that arena, that may be along a BA, bio-available bio-equivalents route plus minus a safety play, because it may have a different profile in terms of an anemia induction. So you'll have to just wait on those, but it's very active and it's underway as we speak, in terms of the XR formulation. ","In terms of combinations, both us, Novartis and external world are investigating multiple combinations in the second line setting and beyond which this theoretic and sometimes very strong preclinical evidence and some clinical evidence. The combinations that we are investigating are Rux plus PI3 kinase delta, we presented the first set of that data at ASH last year. And we\u2019re doing that experiment further this year with continuous dosing rather than the weekly dosing and we were encouraged by the activity we saw in patients that had been on rux for a long time hadn't withdrawn from it, and then had clinic responses as well as symptom improvement, that there was some withdrawal of that when we went to weekly dosing. ","So we want to do that, it continuous experiment this year. The two other combinations we do in our rux plus perm, which is a very strong preclinical rationale and then ruxolitinib plus our JAK1 inhibitor, itacitinib in patients who can't tolerate sufficient doses of rux or can't tolerate it at all and then are switched to itacitinib. So those are all ongoing. Novartis have combinations that are ongoing in an external world as well. But so combination is very important, and it's both an efficacy play and a safety play. ","And then the third arm of that is more and Dash can speak to this is around the research arena and targets. So we have a very important collaboration in terms of looking for further targets here. And then internally, ourselves. Obviously, it's an area we know extremely well and are there better ways of potentially tackling the drivers of these conditions. I don\u2019t know if Dash wants to add anything here?","Dash Dhanak","So, absolutely right. There are a number of approaches one can think about going further than what we regard in terms of, as Steven was talking about the first two aspects of the pillars. And we have a number of discovery programs ongoing, both internally and in collaboration with academic institutions as well as biotechs nationally and internationally around probing really the fundamental underlying mechanisms, in addition to JAK inhibition that won't go after.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Peter Lawson from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.","Peter Lawson","Just on the oral PD1, the next readout is at next year. What can we see and where would you position that drug indications?","Steven Stein","It\u2019s Steven. We filed our IND in October, we went into patients in December last year, it's going really well. There's a lot of interest and excitement in the compound being that it's oral with it potentially very interested in mechanism of action and internalization of the receptor, and will that translate to a clinical differentiator, but this year, the execution of the phase 1, getting to a recommended phase 2 dose, and it's going well, in that regard. Looking at benchmark areas of like lung cancer and melanoma to see what kind of activity there to see if this is efficacy differentiator, and we -- that'll take the most better part of this year, and we would love to show you some clinical data next year. As soon as we have a safe dosing schedule, we will also be pursuing combinations that are relevant in terms of having an oral PD-L1 inhibitor, but you will not see data till 2020.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Reni Benjamin from Raymond James.","Reni Benjamin","I guess just regarding GVHD, the way I kind of look at it is itacitinib coming on board after rux, which will likely be off label quite a bit. Do you guys envision a launch where rux is kind of laying the groundwork in GVHD and when itacitinib comes on board, it just takes over, both at the steroid refractory and steroid naive or can you keep the two indications quite separate to each individual drug? How are you thinking about the commercialization?","Barry Flannelly","Well, we think we have an advantage because we're able to launch, we will be able to launch ruxolitinib Jakafi in GVHD. So we're understanding that market very well right now. So, we've gotten to know the BMT treaters, we've gotten to understand exactly what drugs they're currently using. But then itacitinib, when it gets approved, it really does, in fact, should have a better profile, at least in terms of cytopenias. So we really think that we could continue to develop rux or people will use rux in that setting, but ultimately, itacitinib should be the drug of choice in steroid refractory and acute GVHD.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Incyte. Mike, please go ahead.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's third quarter and nine-months 2018 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com. I'm joined on the call today by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Steven and Dave, who will deliver our prepared remarks, and by Reid, who will join us for the Q&A session.","Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2018 guidance, the commercialization of our products and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline, as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents.","We'll now begin the call with Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. I am pleased to report that Incyte continues to perform very well across all aspects of the business. We have recently delivered exciting data at both the EADV Congress and at ESMO, and we are looking forward to seeing many of you at ASH in San Diego. Total product revenue continues to grow nicely, and we recognized a 25% increase in nine months revenue versus the same period last year. Revenues of over $1.2 billion in the first nine months of 2018 included over $1 billion in Jakafi sales and over $160 million in royalties from Jakavi and Olumiant, reflecting strong demand for both ruxolitinib and baricitinib on a global basis. It's important to note that Q3 net sales for Jakafi were negatively impacted by inventory moves late in the quarter, and Barry will provide additional details in a few minutes.","Patient demand for Jakafi remains strong and slide five provides some historical data charting U.S. patient demand alongside U.S. revenue recognized for Jakafi. Going back to the third quarter of 2012, you can see that Jakafi revenue and the total number of patients taking Jakafi show a fairly consistent rate of growth. Due to the strength in underlying demand and the growing number of patient on Jakafi, we are pleased to be increasing the bottom end of our guidance range so that our guidance for full-year revenue for Jakafi is now a range of $1.37 billion to $1.4 billion.","Before I pass the call to Barry for more details on Jakafi performance, I would like to quickly mention recent updates from our portfolio. It's been an exciting few weeks for Incyte, starting with very encouraging data from ruxolitinib cream in patients with atopic dermatitis presented at EADV last month, as well as data from capmatinib and pemigatinib at the ESMO conference last week. On the regulatory front, we were pleased that the FDA accepted the sNDA for ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute GVHD for Priority Review and assigned a PDUFA date of February 24 next year.","Looking forward, GRAVITAS-301 study of itacitinib in patient with newly diagnosed GVHD is enrolling very well, and both our PD-1 and PI3 kinase-delta programs are on track. We see three baricitinib data in atopic dermatitis also expected in the first half of next year. There is much to be excited about in the coming months.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry for more details on the sales performance of Jakafi.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. Patient demand for Jakafi remains very strong, and we are seeing good uptick in both MF and PV indications.","Slide eight shows a robust growth in patient demand for both MF and PV. As you can see, the total number of MF patients currently on Jakafi, shown in blue, continues to rise, and the pool of MF patients on therapy continues to be greater than PV, shown in orange. The total number of PV patients on Jakafi is growing faster than MF, and we continue to expect that in time the number of PV patients taking Jakafi will overtake MF.","The sales bridge, provided on the left-hand side of slide nine shows continued demand growth in Q3 and the effect of inventory changes on net sales. We saw an unexpected destocking at several large customers late in the third quarter, leading to a negative inventory effect of approximately $8 million in the quarter. The nine-month sales data shown on the right-hand side of slide nine where effects of changes in inventory are normalized shows a strong 21% growth over the same period last year. The number of new patient starts is typically a leading indicator for sales performance, and Q3 new patient demand data are encouraging and provide us with good momentum as we enter the fourth quarter. Giving our confidence in the full-year outlook today, we have adjusted Jakafi guidance by lifting the lower end of the prior guidance range.","Slide 10 shows the consistent yearly growth of Jakafi, adding more than $200 million in net product revenue each year since 2014. We are on target to continue that trend again for the full year of 2018, given that the midpoint of the new guidance range represents more than $250 million in increased Jakafi revenue versus the full year of 2017. I am very pleased that both indications are driving growth as we continue to secure new patients, while also maintaining current patients on therapy for longer.","Given the success of the REACH1 trial, we continue our readiness efforts for potential approval of Jakafi in steroid refractory acute GVHD. Our team has made excellent progress in educating physicians about the benefits that Jakafi provides in both MF and PV indications. And I have every confidence the team will do an equally outstanding job for patients with GVHD.","We submitted the sNDA on schedule during the third quarter based on positive results from REACH1 in patients with steroid refractory acute GVHD, and the FDA has recently accepted it for Priority Review. As we detailed last quarter, we believe our team's size and structure has already been optimized, and we are ready to launch immediately in this indication, if approved.","With that, I'll pass the call over to Steven for an update on our portfolio.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. We believe that JAK inhibition has significant potential as a treatment for graft versus host disease, and we have two pivotal programs that span several aspects for this devastating and often fatal disease. As Barry touched on, we were pleased to have the ruxolitinib sNDA accepted by the FDA for Priority Review based on the results of REACH1. Beyond REACH1, we have three ongoing Phase 3 trials that are all currently expected to yield results next year. REACH2 and REACH3 are evaluating the use of ruxolitinib in steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease and steroid refractory chronic graft versus host disease, respectively. GRAVITAS-301 is the first pivotal trial that is evaluating our JAK1 selective inhibitor, itacitinib, in patients with treatment-na\u00efve acute graft versus host disease. Early next year, we expect to launch a second Phase 3 trial of itacitinib, this time in patients with steroid \u2013 with treatment-na\u00efve chronic graft versus host disease.","There are a significant number of new patients each year that would become eligible for treatment with either itacitinib as a first-line treatment or ruxolitinib, following treatment with steroids, if our trials are successful and we obtain regulatory approvals.","On slide 14, we have included data for pemigatinib, our FGFR1\/2\/3 inhibitor, which was presented recently at ESMO in Munich. If you recall, we presented some initial data from this group of patients at our R&D day in June this year, which showed a disease control rate of 82%, an overall response rate of 24%, and a 6.8-month median progression-free survival. You can see here that as patients remained on therapy, responses have been more durable, and more patients have become responders such that the response rate is now 40% with the median progression-free survival of greater than nine months. Importantly, all tumor response data are from central review.","Recruitment into the FIGHT-202 trial in patients with cholangiocarcinoma is now largely complete, and we'll now wait for the data from the trial to mature. If the data continues to evolve as we expect, we intend to submit an NDA seeking approval of pemigatinib in second-line FGFR2 translocated cholangiocarcinoma next year. We therefore expect cholangiocarcinoma to be the initial indication for pemigatinib with the potential for an approval in FGFR3 mutated bladder cancer, as well as a development program seeking a tumor-agnostic FGFR-altered indication in the future.","Data on capmatinib were also presented at ESMO. Capmatinib is an oral reversible inhibitor of the MET receptor tyrosine kinase and it has shown both high selectivity for MET and is extremely potent against MET exon-14 skipping mutations compared to all other MET inhibitors in development. Capmatinib was discovered by Incyte, was included in the 2009 license agreement with Novartis, and has the potential to be the first MET-selective inhibitor to be approved, given the exciting data presented at ESMO this year. Data at ESMO were from the GEOMETRY mono-1 study being run by Novartis, and these data were in patients with non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon-14 skipping mutations, which occur in up to 4% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer. The response rate seen in this 94-patient trial were clinically meaningful with an overall response rate in second and third-line patients of 39%; and in first line, the response rate was 72%. All data were centrally reviewed and capmatinib showed a manageable safety profile in this challenging patient population. Novartis is guiding to an NDA submission for capmatinib next year, and we are very proud that another Incyte-invented molecule appears to be on the path to potential registration.","Let's move on to our development efforts in inflammation and autoimmunity. We were excited that data from ruxolitinib cream in patients with atopic dermatitis were presented at the recent EADV meeting in Paris and were very well received. As you can see here, the data showed rapid improvements in itch for patients on the ruxolitinib cream versus both placebo and steroid cream, which were seen as early as two days after the first use. These responses, as well as other endpoints based on the Eczema Area and Severity Index and Investigator's Global Assessment scales were durable, and the treatment was not associated with any notable safety or tolerability findings. We are currently in discussions with the FDA to design a Phase 3 program in adults with atopic dermatitis, which we expect to initiate shortly.","Ruxolitinib cream also has potential as a treatment for patients with vitiligo, which is an autoimmune disease of the melanocytes, leading to disfiguring patches of hypopigmentation on the patient's skin, most notably on the face and hands. A small proof of concept trial of ruxolitinib cream has already shown promising results, and a randomized double-blind vehicle-control Phase 2 is ongoing. We expect to announce data from that trial next year.","I'll now pass the call along to Dave to review the financials.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone. The financial update this morning will include GAAP and non-GAAP numbers. For a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP, please refer to our press release. For the third quarter, we recorded $450 million of total revenue on a GAAP basis. This is comprised of $348 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $20 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $51 million of Jakavi royalties from Novartis, $11 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly, and $20 million of contract revenues for a milestone earned from Lilly for the commencement of the Phase 3 program in lupus. Total revenues for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $430 million and exclude the $20 million milestone from Lilly.","Our Jakafi gross to net for the quarter was 13.5%, and we expect that our gross net adjustment for full-year 2018 will be approximately 14%. Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $19 million on a non-GAAP basis. This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, and then payments of royalties to Novartis on Jakafi net sales. Our R&D expense for the quarter was $251 million on a non-GAAP basis, primarily driven by clinical development programs, and our SG&A expense for the quarter was $85 million on a non-GAAP basis.","Moving on to non-operating items, we recorded GAAP and non-GAAP net interest income of $10 million in the third quarter. Our net income for the third quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $83 million, which is double that reported for the same period last year.","Looking at our year-to-date results, our net income on a non-GAAP basis was $137 million. We ended the third quarter with $1.4 billion in cash and marketable securities, and we expect to end the year with approximately the same amount. Slide 21 provides a summary reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. As I mentioned earlier, a more detailed reconciliation is provided in this morning's press release.","My last slide provides a summary of our current financial guidance. Based on Jakafi's year-to-date performance, we are increasing the lower end of our net sales guidance by $20 million to a revised range of $1.37 billion to $1.4 billion. We are also decreasing the high end of our R&D guidance by $50 million to a revised range of $1.15 billion to $1.2 billion and increasing our SG&A guidance from a range of $390 million to $410 million to a new range of $420 million to $440 million, based on our run rates for the year to-date. Our guidance for non-GAAP net income of $200 million to $250 million is unchanged.","Herv\u00e9 will now conclude our prepared remarks by summarizing our expected news flow.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Dave. And I would like to pause here for just a minute to say a few words of thanks for the invaluable role you have played in the Incyte leadership team since joining us in 2014. And I would like to take this opportunity to publicly thank you for all of your contribution and to wish you well in your retirement when we identify your successor.","So, to end our discussion, I would like to share our key objectives for between now and the end of 2019. On the regulatory front, we have three important goals. First, we expect to achieve FDA approval for ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute GVHD in the first quarter of 2019. It may come sooner, and if so, we are ready to launch. Second, should the pemigatinib data continue to evolve as we expect, we intend to submit an NDA for cholangiocarcinoma next year. Third, Novartis has stated that it plans to submit an NDA for capmatinib in non-small cell lung cancer with MET exon-14 skipping mutations next year.","Regarding key clinical data, we are currently expecting results from several registration-enabling trials before the end of 2019. Firstly, we expect to announce the result of the Phase 3 program for baricitinib in atopic dermatitis. Then data from three GVHD pivotal trials, GRAVITAS-301 with itacitinib and REACH2 and REACH3 with ruxolitinib are also expected to be available during 2019. We also expect to complete recruitment of the continuous dosing cohort for pemigatinib in patients with bladder cancer. If data from this cohort are positive, they could form the basis for a regulatory submission.","We also anticipate initiating several Phase 3 programs before the end of next year. So GRAVITAS-309 trial is in preparation and we study itacitinib in patients with treatment-na\u00efve chronic GVHD, and we are also planning on opening a Phase 3 program evaluating ruxolitinib cream in adults with atopic dermatitis, and if the Phase 2 is successful, a Phase 3 program in patients with vitiligo.","Finally, we plan to start Phase 3 trial of pemigatinib in both cholangiocarcinoma and first-line bladder cancer. We believe that there is a significant value embedded in our portfolio, and it's up to us to execute on these opportunities in the coming months. By creating the right molecule and working towards clinical success, we aim to create value for both shareholders and society by bringing new and innovative therapies to patients. In doing so, we expect to drive Incyte to a sustained and significant profitability.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thanks. Our first question today is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thank you for taking my questions. So, I have two questions on graft versus host disease. So firstly, in light of the upcoming PDUFA date for the REACH1 study, could you comment on the education required here on the sales side and any additional build you might require in terms of your sales force? And then, secondly, in light of this positive data, how does that read through to the other RUX studies in graft versus host as well as itacitinib? And then, specifically, for itacitinib, what is the benefit of JAK1 alone in the treatment-na\u00efve setting versus JAK1\/2? Thank you.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Salveen. This is Barry. I'll take the first part of your question and hand it over to Steven for the second part of the question. So, in terms of the build, so we already have, at the \u2013 throughout this year, we've added 25 sales representatives, three MSLs, and two oncology nurse educators. And that was to get ready, in fact, for GVHD but also to take advantage of continued growth opportunities for Jakafi in myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera. So, those oncology sales representatives are actually positioned around the top centers that do stem cell transplants and where most GVHD would be found. So, I think, as we said before, the top 50% \u2013 at the top 50, stem cell transplant centers account for about 70% of the transplants. So, we think it's really targeted. Our training is beginning now for \u2013 so our training materials are all prepared in terms of educating our internal teams, including the sales teams. We call on many of these targets already, these \u2013 about 50% of the physicians that are doing transplants because, remember, some of them are doing transplants for myelofibrosis patients.","So, we know the centers. We've been profiling the centers. We have another team that we call our national account managers that have been making sure that we'll be able to have Jakafi on formulary for steroid-refractory acute GVHD. So, we think we're well-prepared in terms of that education. And then, of course, we'll educate healthcare professionals about the benefits that Jakafi provides in this patient population. And we're fully prepared in putting together materials for that.","With that, I'll hand it over to Steven.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Barry. Thanks for the question, Salveen. So, you asked about the read-through from the REACH1 results to the REACH2 program, which is in steroid-refractory acutes as well, but a randomized study against best available therapy, and then REACH3, which is in chronic graft versus host disease and also randomized study. Overall, the read is positive, given that it's JAK inhibition with a few nuances. Acute disease is generally an apoptotic disease, whereas chronic disease is more a fibrotic disease. But given that we have proof of concept in both entities, we obviously feel strongly about the likelihood of probably of success here and thus we conducted these large Phase 3 programs.","So, overall positive reads there. The same applies to itacitinib, even though it's more selective for JAK1. Again, JAK inhibition being important across the spectrum of graft versus host disease, let me just remind you of itacitinib's proof of concept data at actually a few years ago, which showed a very high response rate in steroid-na\u00efve as well as in steroid-refractory. But the steroid-na\u00efve response rate was 20 points higher and thus gave us proof of concept to go ahead with GRAVITAS-301. Why is it important? Because of the sparing of JAK2, there's expected to be relatively less cytopenias. And given that these patients are steroid-na\u00efve acute to immediately post-transplant, what they're struggling with in terms of morbidities, often cytopenias in terms of low platelets, low white cells, anemias. So, the cytopenias-sparing effect should be helpful and should translate to increased success and tolerability. Thanks.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Marc Frahm from Cowen and Company. Your line is now live.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. Just one \u2013 kind of following up Salveen, when we think about the itacitinib data and GRAVITAS-301, can you talk about what type of effect do you think you need to show to kind of justify moving an expensive therapy kind of into that front line in more of a contract-type of setting, like transplants? And is it just the response rate? Or is there some other aspect that we should really be focusing on to justify that?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, thanks for the question. Again, it's Steven. Generally speaking, steroids have approximately a 40% to 50% response rate with the attendant side effects, particularly when they're used over the long-term, which are well-known in terms of steroid side effects. So, from our point of view, a response rate that's one north of that and in absolute numbers can be quantified, but it should be higher than steroids. And then, in terms of what we know, in terms of tolerability, and you have got ample evidence of long-term use of ruxolitinib in MF and PV now. The profile is very different from long-term use of steroids. So, the effect would have to be that higher response rate and a better tolerability profile that would enable people to get off of the steroids, and that's what we're looking for in GRAVITAS-301. And that would be an additional clinical benefit to the actual treatment of graft versus host disease is the ability for patients to be weaned off of the steroids.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, great. And then, just for Barry, on the thing about pemigatinib, and you're potentially launching or getting filed next year in cholangiocarcinoma, could you just talk about the build-up that is going to need to be done, the timing of that for commercial organization and solid tumors that doesn't really exist right now?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Well, we're hopeful that will get approved as soon as possible. But we're just working on exactly the size of the team that we'll need for this patient population in cholangiocarcinoma with FGFR2 translocations. So, those efforts are really ongoing, and we'll continue to update you as we get closer to an actual launch date.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan. Your line is now live.","Unknown Speaker","Hey, guys, this is Sean (27:09) on for Cory. Congrats on the quarter. And just a couple questions on cholangiocarcinoma. So, the updated results from ESMO look to be quite promising. It actually looks like there was a significant portion of patients in whom the response took a bit longer to evolve. In your previous update, I think there was like 11 out of 45 responses versus 19 out of 47 responses at ESMO. So, just kind of wondering the kinetics of the response surprise you a bit?","And as a follow-up, maybe you could share with us some color around your filing plans. Is there a chance that we could potentially see a BTB (27:43) Priority Review in this indication? And are there discussions currently ongoing with the FDA?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, Sean (27:49), it's Steven. Thank you for your question. Yes, it's a good surprise, right? The ESMO updated data showed that centrally reviewed response rate of 40%, which is robust, and as you noted, increased with time. For reasons in one particular tumor versus others is we see that it's not entirely clear. But obviously the biology of that particular FGFR2 translocated cholangio is such that over time you can get increased cytoreduction.","Probably, a clue for that came if you look at the entire waterfall plot is the disease control rate is north of 80%. So, just about everybody is having some degree of cytoreduction from the get-go. And obviously, over time, those improved in a substantive way that were also really durable. So, given the context, given that this is second-line cholangiocarcinoma, given that chemotherapy in the setting has maybe a 10 \u2013 at a stretch 15% response rate with very short progression pre-survival, we believe these results are now in the territory to meet potential regulatory approval-type data.","And to \u2013 further to your question, we will be discussing, of course, with the regulatory authorities, does this meet breakthrough designation criteria, and as such, will it qualify for Priority Review? And again, we feel strongly that that's starting to look increasingly to be the case. I am focused in my comments on the FDA. We didn't mention Europe because the root there for single-arm studies is harder. But given this updated data set, we will obviously be discussing these in Europe with the regulatory authorities as well. So this now meet potential regulatory approval criteria. So, very encouraged by the data set and surprised in a good way by the increase in response rate that's durable over time.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is now live.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys, and thanks for the question. Dave, I also want to offer up some congrats on your retirement. Seems like we've had this conversation before. Barry, another one on Jakafi, when you look at the GVHD opportunity, what do you think could be the initial uptake curve based on REACH1 and the unmet need. I guess my sense is do you think docs will want to wait ultimately until REACH2 or \u2013 2 or 3 data are fully out? And then I have one follow-up for Herv\u00e9.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","No, Geoff, I actually think the uptake will be quite good, obviously, what the patient population is. Steroid-refractory GVHD in the United States, we say it's around 1,500 patients. We think that the data we've shown so far are compelling, better than anything else in this particular setting, able to get patients off of steroids. Obviously, these patients are very, very sick and they really need to get their GVHD under control right away. And it looks like we're able to achieve that with the profile that we have. So, I'm very encouraged about that opportunity. And then we're looking forward to getting approval for chronic GVHD and we think that'll be a good opportunity as well. So, we're looking forward to both of these indications.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, Herv\u00e9, you've got a great franchise in Jakafi which obviously could drive pretty robust profitability. And I argue you're getting zero credit for pretty much anything in the pipeline beyond what's in Phase 3. So, why continue to develop so many assets that are earlier stage? Do you think you would add more value by, for example, narrowing the pipeline breadth and focusing a little bit more on profits today? Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","I think your question is really about our overall R&D investments or what we believe is that the quality of the science we have here at Incyte, the quality of the discovery team is now proven. We spoke about ruxolitinib and baricitinib already approved, commercially available. We are speaking of now pemigatinib, itacitinib, capmatinib, so that will be like five molecules that are coming from our own discovery group that have been now very close to crossing the line and showing a lot of very promising data. So, it shows that R&D done the right way can be extremely productive. And before you have late-stage products, obviously you have to have early-stage products. And that's why we have a portfolio of early-stage program. We don't know yet from that portfolio which one will be the breakthrough that are moving very quickly, and which one may end up being more on hold.","I must say, in terms of investment, most of it is coming from the late-stage portfolio. So, if you look at the way the investment is calibrated between early-stage and late-stage, what you see is that the pre-proof of concept program usually have a relatively modest impact on the models \u2013 I mean it's a relatively smaller impact on the R&D budget. And our choice to develop these products is really based on the data and the science and the medical need and trying to improve treatment of cancer. Or outside of cancer, as you can see, there are now a number of fairly interesting programs we have. And I must say, the atopic derm and the vitiligo program for ruxolitinib cream are, assuming we get good data from the Phase 3, are going to be very productive for our corporation.","So, that being said, obviously, we are very cautious about our investments in R&D. And as I said in my remarks, the way we see the entire corporation evolve is increase profitability. I think Dave spoke about the profitability we have seen in this quarter, which was double what we had a year ago, and that's a trend over a period of time that you will see confirmed with the progress of our business.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess, one, can you just comment briefly on the inventory drawdown and whether you expect that to reverse in coming quarters or if there was a specific driver of that drawdown this quarter? And then maybe secondly, can you just comment on the \u2013 what are the key issues that you're speaking with the FDA about the Phase 3 for atopic dermatitis with ruxolitinib cream? Thanks.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Okay, Matt, so I'll take the first part. No, we think this is one-time. Well, inventory changes periodically. We've seen it over a quarter, sometimes the inventory is above the normal range that we experience, sometimes it's below the normal range, which is what we say is two and a half to three weeks of inventory in the channel. And even if you move a couple of days one way or the other, now that's about $12 million. Was it a driver of the inventory burn off this quarter? Well, we took a 3% price increase at the beginning of September, and historically, we've seen after we take a price increase that inventory does go down, but generally it's gradually over time. This was very quick and a little bit more dramatic that we saw some destocking. To be honest, even in October that's already reversed itself. We're on budget for October, we're on budget to hit the guidance that we just gave before. We're planning to deliver close to $250 million in 2018 above and beyond what we sold in 2017. So, we're very confident moving forward. And I'll hand it over to Steven for the second part.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Matt. Thanks for your question. This is Steven. I mean, they're the obvious issues, but I'll go through them. The type of things we are discussing, given the proof-of-concept work we've conducted and presented already are the dosing, the need to study more than one dose or not. The number of studies that are needed in this setting in dermatology, conventionally it's at least two studies. The size of those studies, given that the safety databases in dermatology indications tend to be 1,000 patients or north of that. And whether or not an active comparator is needed or not in these studies. I think those are the four main issues. The good news is we're very close to closure on those and we aim, as Herv\u00e9 said in the call, at a minimum to get these studies going in the first quarter of 2019, if not sooner. So, we're in a good place, we have the right set of proof-of-concept data, we have agreement on most of these issues, and we should be going soon.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC. Your line is now live.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi. Thanks very much for taking my questions. Two questions on Jakafi lifecycle. I guess first off, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the ongoing Jakafi combo studies, perhaps put a finer point on the timing for upcoming readouts and maybe give us a sense for your view what's the (37:37) overall bar there, what you would need to show from a symptomatic improvement standpoint, from intolerability to warrant potential exploration here, not just in refractory patients, but in front-line as a potential Jakafi replacement. What would be acceptable in terms of additional AEs? And then I had a follow-up.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","So, Brian, it's Steven. Thanks for your question. Obviously, the lifecycle management of RUX itself is incredibly important to us, given that we have patent runway in the United States and beyond at least through 2027. So, it's a large program with numerous efforts. You focused your question on one of them, which is combination work. We have various combinations ongoing. The one that you'll see that's currently the most encouraging to us, and you'll see data readouts on relatively soon in upcoming meeting at the end of the year, which we already showed you a sneak preview in 10 patients at the R&D day there's a ruxolitinib plus PI3 kinase program, the delta program with 50465. And in that early read, we showed you in the 10 patients at the R&D day, you saw both a further decrease in spleen volume in terms of actual \u2013 and a reasonably objective measure of activity as well as symptom improvement. Remember, RUX itself is such a fantastically successful drug that it's not easy to recruit these trials quickly. And most people stay on RUX for a very long time and do really well. So, the additional needs beyond, in terms of regulatory endpoints, aren't very clearly defined. We've been working with the FDA in the space because we have numerous combinations ongoing and trying to come to a very strict definition of what constitutes, if you will, \"ruxolitinib failure or RUX refractoriness\". And then put people appropriately on those studies to make sure we always have apple-to-apple comparisons across our programs and others. So, they're not strictly defined yet, but we've been working very carefully to get those to you.","We also have ongoing programs, just to mention, with ruxolitinib plus our PIM inhibitor, which has really good pre-clinical data. And then a combination with JAK1 with itacitinib itself that's ongoing as well in patients who either can't tolerate doses of RUX or have to come off of it, and then we have a switch strategy as well. So, it's a very large combination program across all of them with the lead clinical evidence now for which you'll see updated data at the meeting end of this year is the RUX plus PI3 kinase-delta program. And hopefully, the endpoints will be more clearly defined over time.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","That's really helpful. And then, just to follow up to that, in terms of next generation ruxolitinib formulations, I know you recently published data on an earlier formulation. Just wondering where you are with respect to optimization. How much cytopenia reductions and\/or improvement in efficacy you could potentially achieve and might need to show for payers and KOLs to support use of a next-gen once a generic RUX is available? Thanks.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Brian. This is Reid. I'll take your question. You're right. We did publish some data on a sustained-release formulation of ruxolitinib, and there's actually some intellectual property around that as well, which has recently been locked down. Those are important efforts for us, and they really dovetail with the remarks that Steven just had on the combination work. In some respects, that is kind of the first line of the lifecycle strategy is to try to work on a more optimized pharmacokinetics profile of ruxolitinib that's beneficial in terms of patient usage but also potentially brings important benefits in terms of their cytopenias or even the benefits that ruxolitinib achieves in terms of spleen volume reduction and symptomatic improvement. So, that's sort of the first leg. I think the combination study that Steven outlined is the second leg. And just for completeness, the third leg is a continued strong interest in active research programs we have internally, both fully in-house and in collaboration with academic and company partners to try to identify new targets in the space that could be approached as, frankly, to obsolete ruxolitinib one day. And so, these are all three active efforts within Incyte and I think help to underscore just how significant the commitment is that we have to MPN patients.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Katherine Xu from William Blair. Your line is now live.","Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. I just have a question on pemigatinib. Can you comment on the intermittent versus continuous dosing of the drug in both cholangio and in bladder? And then, are you confident in terms of efficacy that you could attain with this increase in dosing? And then, on the safety side, what would you expect with a more intensified dosing mechanism? And mechanistically, understanding that these are FGFR2 or 3 mutation-driven cancers, but does it make sense to find a combo partner to further increase the efficacy in these patients? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Katherine, hi. It's Steven. Thank you for your question. It's a good one. So, in terms of the dose we netted out at the end of Phase 2 trying to weave the therapeutic ratio between efficacy and safety, we had come up with a 13.5 milligram two weeks on, one week off dosing regimen, which many competitors at the time were doing as well, given the tolerability profile as regard to hyperphosphatemia, GI side effects, et cetera.","Our cholangiocarcinoma dosing regimen, as you've seen, is the intermittent one, 13.5, two weeks on, one week off, with the efficacy we just showed at ESMO and just spoke about. In the interim in FGFR3 mutated bladder cancer, the lead competitor there, the J&J compound, had switched from intermittent dosing to different continuous dosing regimens and had shown incremental improvements in efficacy from the mid-20% range up to the low 40% range and had filed earlier this year, it achieved breakthrough status. And that's the way they're doing their program in bladder cancer.","So, what we've done in bladder cancer is switch from intermittent dosing to continuous because, again, we look like we have a similar response rate with intermittent there, and we're just beginning that continuous dosing journey and should enroll fully our study at some point next year, as Herv\u00e9 said in his remarks. What we'd want to see from that is an incremental improvement in efficacy like they did in bladder cancer. Your safety question is pertinent, though. If you look at discontinuation rates between intermittent regimens and continuous regimens for our competitors, they almost double. So, you can go upwards of a 20% discontinuation rate, where you do continuous dosing. And obviously, that'll have to be watched because you want patients to stay on therapy. You want durability of responses, and you want long progression-free survival. So, that's the therapeutic ratio you have to weave when you do this effort. And it is likely that \u2013 same with us with continuous dosing that the tolerability profile may worsen slightly, although our discontinuation rates to date, with caveats on low numbers, are actually much lower. So, that's encouraging.","In terms of partners across the spectrum, obviously, at the moment we have been talking mostly about monotherapy efforts, but as you move up to first line, particularly in bladder cancer, we may be examining efforts in combination with IO in terms of checkpoint blockade. That may be one of the relevant areas to attend to. And as you know, we have our own PD-1 inhibitor, so that's something we'd be interested in going forward. There are, as Herv\u00e9 mentioned, other FGFR potentially driven diseases and there may be a way of doing a more agnostic approach across different tumor types, just like was done with checkpoint inhibitors with MSI high tumors, for example. And that's something we are going to be exploring actively next year. So, that's the status of the program. We have all the combination partners we need internally at the moment for the efforts we want to conduct. So, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tyler Van Buren from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now live.","Tyler M. Van Buren - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks and good morning. In the release, you specifically mentioned a positive enrollment of the GRAVITAS trial. So, as we think about the enrollment as a positive indicator of potential market uptake, could you elaborate on some of the factors driving enrollment in that trial? And then as a follow-up question to that, I believe the long-term Jakafi guidance includes the smaller acute steroid refractory indication. So, as you think about the expansion of that into both chronic and steroid-na\u00efve in the broader GVHD opportunity, could you help us put some numbers around the magnitude of that potential opportunity in terms of sales as you guys currently think about it?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Tyler, hi. It's Steven. I'll go first and then hand it over to Barry. So, just to mention, the GRAVITAS-301 program that you referenced is with itacitinib, our JAK1 inhibitor. And then you turned over the rest of the question to RUX, so, I'll let Barry address that part. But for steroid-na\u00efve acute, I think it's numerous factors. We've been really encouraged by the rapidity of enrollment and the enthusiasm around it. And I think it's related to the fact that there's a large unmet need in this area with a disease that can be of high morbidity and actually high mortality at six months, so there's that need to address. Plus, now the knowledge through numerous publications that JAK inhibition is highly effective, so people want to get on to these studies and have it tested. And I think those are \u2013 and then the global nature of the way we're conducting the study across the U.S. and Western Europe as well as some Japanese enrollment. So, those are all driving very encouraging enrollment and we're really happy to see where that is. I'll pass it over to Barry for your commercial question.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","So, Tyler, I think you were asking two separate questions. One is that the long-term guidance that we have on Jakafi, which includes acute steroid-refractory GVHD and chronic steroid-refractory GVHD as well as ET, and that brings us to the $2.5 billion to $3 billion guidance that we have given before. In terms of itacitinib, obviously, it would be used mostly in what we're currently studying in treatment-na\u00efve acute GVHD and treatment-na\u00efve chronic GVHD, and globally, so that is a global product. So, that is separate from our guidance on Jakafi. So, globally for itacitinib, we see about 15,000 patients that would have both treatment-na\u00efve acute GVHD and treatment-na\u00efve chronic GVHD. And then you can do the numbers from there. And obviously, we haven't done pricing and other forecasts around that. But we know what the opportunity is, it's bigger than the \u2013 perhaps the steroid-refractory setting and we'll take advantage of that. Thanks.","Tyler M. Van Buren - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ren Benjamin from Raymond James. Your line is now live.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hey, good morning. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter. Can you talk us, or walk us through kind of your thoughts regarding the data from competitors in terms of pemigatinib and how you're viewing that data in terms of indications perspective where you're actually competing in things like bladder or do you think certain indications are going to be free and clear? And related to that, can you talk about the importance of Foundation Medicine companion diagnostics or companion diagnostics, in general, and how that could impact your uptick?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","It's Steven, I'll go first. Others may want to add to my comments. I think when you start getting more competitors, it's sort of validation of that you're chasing a target, although there is no approved FGFR inhibitor yet but that's recognized as an oncogenic driver, which you have compounds that are active, and you've seen activity data now in cholangiocarcinoma, which is FGFR2 translocated, FGFR3 mutated bladder. And in fact, a myeloproliferative neoplasm that we are studying as well, that's FGFR1 driven through an 8p11 chromosomal translocation. And then potentially other areas where FGFR may be a driver, but it's a little more unclear, because you're often looking at amplification rather than mutations.","So, in terms of talking directly about competitors, which I won't do, but it's interesting that the field is as busy as it is. That's encouraging, it's good for patients, and we can learn where others are ahead. And I just gave you the perfect example earlier of the J&J switch with their inhibitor from intermittent to continuous and getting that efficacy bump, which we can clearly learn from and catch up pretty quickly. So, we don't view bladder as gone in any way, we think we have a superb molecule, we're going to do the continuous dosing experiment. As I said, we should finish enrollment sometime next year and we want to be very competitive there with what we think is an excellent compound.","In cholangio, our view is we're ahead of everybody else. And as we said with the dataset, we will take it to hopefully a regulatory filing next year.","In terms of the companion diagnostic, the way it works from a regulatory point of view is one has to have that attached to your study. We're working with the lead developer in this area, Foundation Medicine, with their test. It's important from the regulatory perspective in getting the study completed, done, and attached to your label.","From an uptake point of view, I'll make a clinical comment, and then I don't know if anybody wants to add anything. What happens in the real world thereafter is a bit of a mix, is that people often have local testing available through their centers under CLIA certification in the U.S. or other means in the rest of the world. And as long as it's done appropriately to measure either the FGFR2 translocation or FGFR3, they will often go ahead and treat patients without waiting for the one that's actually per label from an uptake point of view. So \u2013 and that's increasingly being done across the globe now in various places. And certainly, once you have a validated pathway with an approved drug, you start seeing testing become routine. So, you can go back 20 years to HER2 in breast cancer and then EGFR in lung, et cetera, et cetera. So, they become routine diagnostic things. So, from a clinical point of view, uptake should sort of in some ways take care of itself. I don't know if anybody else wants to make other comments.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","And then just maybe as a quick follow-up or a separate question for Herv\u00e9, when we think about it from a company perspective, there's this growing franchise of what appears to be non-oncology, and specifically dermatology. And so, how should we be thinking about that going forward? Is this something that is really a focus? Is it something that could be packaged and kind of sold off and monetized? Any sort of thoughts regarding that?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","It's a good question and it's part of \u2013 related to an earlier question about the value creation through research and development. I think that's a very good example of a project that we have been working on in general now for more than two years of looking at non-cancer related application of the technology coming from research. So, we have a group of biologists working on that, and it's starting to translate into clinical programs. And these clinical programs are going in many different indications. We have obviously the dermatology group of indications where there are a number of projects but we have also a program in ulcerative colitis, we have a number of pre proof-of-concept small programs trying to establish these products.","So, as we get these proof-of-concepts, we will have to make decision on doing the Phase 3 ourselves or to find a partner. In the case of dermatology for atopic derm, and I can say already for vitiligo, we will do the pivotal Phase 3 studies internally. And as we are seeing this data maturing and as we get the result of the Phase 3, that's where we will have decisions to make on how do we plan to do the commercialization for each of these products. At this stage, these decisions have not been made. You can imagine that there are differences depending maybe on the geographies also. So, we are looking at it as Asia, Europe, U.S. And we are looking at it as do we go and do it ourselves, or is it better value for the corporation and the shareholders to do it with a partner? And all of this is up in the air now. We are in the process of identifying and quantifying our options to make sure we choose the one that is the most productive.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Christopher Marai from Nomura Securities. Your line is now live.","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. Maybe to follow up more on the topical RUX. So with respect to atopic dermatitis, could you perhaps comment on the potential size of the Phase 3 that you're going to be required to run? And then secondarily, any other safety studies beyond the typical Phase 3 that will be required for that? And then, secondarily on vitiligo, obviously, Phase 2 is ongoing. Is that a registration-worthy trial? And then I have a follow-up. Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yes, it's Steven. Christopher, thanks for your question. So, on the size of a Phase 3 program for atopic dermatitis, I alluded to it a little earlier. But the FDA requirements on safety are the main driver here. We'd need at least 1,000 patients' worth of data probably across two studies. It could end up being slightly north of that. The good thing is these studies are relatively easy to do and go really quickly, as you just witnessed from the baricitinib atopic dermatitis program. So, there's no concern there. We'll get the right size in and get the right safety database to do that.","For vitiligo, we have a very well-constructed proof-of-concept study similar to the way we did atopic derm with the dose ranging, the right control, et cetera. Would that suffice? Your question was on a standalone for regulatory approval. It's somewhat unlikely in the derm space. You usually have to conduct the studies I just mentioned. But given that we will have a large safety database from atopic derm, it's certainly something we would discuss, depending on the results. But just to manage expectations, the likelihood is that we would have to conduct, as Herv\u00e9 said, the vitiligo Phase 3 program to get it across the finish line there. Thanks.","Christopher N. Marai - Nomura","Got it. And then, just a follow-up, thinking on about the commercialization for pemi, it's obviously, as someone else brought up, outside hema onc and in solid tumors. I was just wondering, could you remind us of the option that you have to co-promote capmatinib and how that option to co-promote might work into plans to also commercialize or set up commercialization of pemi? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Herv\u00e9 here. I will answer. On the worldwide basis, we have no intention to go into co-promotion of capmatinib at this stage. I think the contract we have with Novartis on the capmatinib gives them the right to promote it. And so, that's not part of the plan. I would say, on hematology versus oncology, you have \u2013 depending on the countries, you have a separation of the two specialties on that. I mean most of them are practicing in the same buildings, in the same hospital. So, you can imagine that there is from hematology commercial organization already synergies for launching an indication in oncology, like for example, cholangiocarcinoma, if it is the first to come up. Cholangiocarcinoma is relatively rare. So, it's an indication where we believe we could fairly easily be promoting it by ourselves in a way that will not involve a very large increase of our sales force.","So, depending on other indications that would be coming after cholangiocarcinoma, I think bladder cancer will be a specific different type of customer base, in fact, with some of them being in the urology department. So, we will have to address as we go. My experience with hematology-oncology and the mix of products in both specialties over a number of countries \u2013 a large number of countries over a number of years is that there is a lot of ways you can organize it geographically or by specialty, depending on the density of your customer population. And that's probably what we will be doing.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, in the interest of time, we have one final question from Carter Gould from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning. Thanks for squeezing me in. Dave, congrats on your retirement. I want to ask on the RUX program in AD, I want to understand better a little bit the stage gate to starting some studies in pediatrics. How do you and I guess FDA feel with the safety profile potentially in that population? And I guess, how critical is that to how you see the value creation opportunity in AD? And then as a follow-up, Herv\u00e9, I appreciate your comments around the relative spend coming from early-stage programs. Any intention to increase your disclosures around where R&D spend is coming today?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Carter, I'll go first and then Herv\u00e9 will take your second part. It's Steven. So, the RUX program in total will look at patients initially from 12 years of age and above with mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. And that will address the vast majority of that population. In terms of the pediatric set in the 2 to 11-year age gap, per the definition, that is what we are discussing with the FDA at the moment. It's an area we'd like to address. We need to just work out with them what they would consider safe dosing in terms, again, of the therapeutic ratio. And that should follow thereafter. But the program should start initially in ages 12 and above and that will address most of the mild-to-moderate population with which we want to go after with the ruxolitinib cream.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","So, on your question about R&D allocation, obviously I think it's an important question, in fact, because as you can see, there are a lot of aspects of what we do that is very much quantified and rational and based on our projects. And the more clarity we can give on how resources are allocated, I think the better it is. So, we are looking at what is the sort of the norm in our industry. So, we have been looking at how other companies have been giving more clarity on their R&D allocation and we will be considering doing some of that or all of it in the future when \u2013 at the time we are reporting next year.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

You may begin.","Pamela Murphy","Good morning and welcome to Incyte\u2019s first quarter, 2013 conference call. On the call today are Paul Friedman, Incyte\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Daly, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Dave Hastings, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rich Levy, Executive Vice President, Chief Drug Development and Medical Officer; and Eric Siegel, Executive Vice President and General Counsel. ","Paul will begin with a brief overview of the quarter, then Dave will describe our first quarter financial results and Jim will follow with an update on the ongoing commercialization of Jakafi. Paul will close with a description of the rest of the pipeline and then open up the call for Q&A. ","Before beginning, we like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for the commercialization of Jakafi, our development plans for Jakafi, and other indications, as well as other compounds in our pipeline. ","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2012, and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents. Paul.","Paul Friedman ","Good morning everyone. The first quarter was quite productive for Incyte. We had solid growth for Jakafi, which is obviously important from a revenue perspective, but the new prescription also represent patients who may experience the benefits of the first FDA approved treatment for intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis. ","At the same time we continue to progress the development of Jakafi and other potential indications. Phase III response study of Jakafi in polycythemia vera is fully enrolled and expected to read out in early \u201814, and the results from the Phase II recap study of Jakafi in pancreatic cancer are expected in the second half of this year. These are important potential growth catalysts for Jakafi in new patient populations with high unmet medical need. ","Later in the call I\u2019ll share some more information with you about the pipeline and Jim will outline activities that we believe will lead to continued solid growth for Jakafi. But first, I\u2019ll turn the call over to David to review our financial performance in the first quarter. ","Dave Hastings ","Thanks Paul and good morning everybody. Lets begin with Jakafi, for which we recorded $48.3 million of first quarter net product revenues. Additionally we recorded $5.9 million in product royalties from Novartis, for sales for Jakavi outside the United States. ","In addition we announced that week that we earned a $25 million milestone from Novartis, based on the formal initiation of a Phase II clinical trial, the c-MET Inhibitor 28060. This amount will be received and recorded as revenue in the second quarter. ","Our gross net adjustment for product revenue recognized was approximately $5.1 million or 9.5% for the first quarter.","As I mentioned in our last call, we expected our growth to net adjustment to be higher in the first quarter than the rest of the year, because of our share of the doughnut hole for Medicare Part B patients. We still expect that our full year gross net adjustment will range from 8% to 9%. ","Our cost of goods sold for the first quarter was immaterial, as our starting to finished goods inventory was previously expensed as R&D prior to FDA approval. In terms of operating expenses, SG&A was within our expectations, while R&D expense came in slightly below our expectations. ","From a cash perspective we ended the quarter with $270 million. This is a strong cash position and we have multiple sources of cash flow now. Therefore we are well positioned to fund our growth. ","Jim will now provide more color around Jakafi performance in the first quarter. Jim. ","Jim Daly ","Thank you Dave and good morning everyone. Our first quarter results reflect continued solid execution of our growth strategy for Jakafi in MF. We added new patients at a steady rate consistent with the previous quarters, while making gradual but meaningful improvement in persistency. ","In terms of quarter-over-quarter growth, net revenues grew 12% with the following components of growth. Underlying demand is measured by bottles dispensed and accounts for approximately 7%, net price accounted for approximately 2%, and inventory accounted for approximately 3%. Channel inventories remain within a consistent normal range of 3 to 3.5 weeks. ","In the quarter we continue to add new patients at a steady rate. Roughly half of new patient starts came from new prescribers, with the remaining half coming from repeat prescribers. We continue to make inroads with our target physicians. We believe later adopters are motivated by an increased awareness of the overall survival data presented at ASH, while exiting prescribers are motivated by the impressive improvement in spleen volume and constitutional symptoms they are seeing in their MF patients. ","Through the first quarter, more than 40% of our target prescribers have prescribed Jakafi at least once and about one-third of those have written for two or more patients. We expect breadth and depth of prescribing to continue to expand, driven by one, educational programs to help physicians identify appropriate new patients, including those who do not carry the JAK2 V617F mutation. We continue to reinforce the fact that Jakafi is targeted to the JAK pathway and not necessarily any particular mutation. ","Number two, programs including direct to patient and allied health professional activities to assist MF patients in communicating their symptoms to their physicians; and finally three, positive experience as a catalyst to treat more patients. ","Turing to persistency, we continue to see increasing use of lower dosage strengths, which is driven by physicians individualizing treatment, in particular by starting patients at appropriate doses and titrating downward if medically necessary. ","In the first quarter of 2013, five and 10 milligrams strengths represented approximately 44% of dispensed bottles, versus 37% in the first half and 41% in the second half of last year. Absent the use of dose titration or lower doses, patients with low baseline hemoglobin and\/or platelet accounts are at the highest risk for discontinuation in the first eight to 12 weeks. ","The use of lower doses in these populations is increasing and we expect the trend to continue as a result of (1) rapid and appropriate follow-up by our field base sales and medical teams with new prescribes; (2) enhanced outreach to patients through Incyte cares and specialty pharmacies; (3) increased awareness by prescribers of additional dose titration data from ASH. Additionally, we now have data from our studies of patients with low platelets and we expect expanded dosing guidance in our label sometime in the second quarter. ","To assist physicians in titrating patients appropriately, we introduced the Jakafi dose modification program late in the first quarter, which enables physicians to order a lower strength bottle of Jakafi free of charge, for any patient requiring a dose titration in 21 days or less from receiving their last prescription. ","The objective of this program is to make it as easy as possible, both financially and administratively for a physician to down titrate to the most appropriate dose for a given patient. While early in its implementation, we are seeing active utilization of the program and it is serving as an effective tool to highlight the importance of dose modification, especially during the first eight to 12 weeks of treatment. ","In summary, our first quarter performance is consistent with our expectations for steady growth in dispensed bottles, largely driven by new patients and a realistically achievable improvement and persistency. We remain confident in our ability to deliver our guidance of $210 million to $225 million in net sales in 2013. ","In a moment Paul will talk about our pipeline, which had near, mid and long term catalysts. I\u2019m especially excited about the PV indication for Jakafi. With the response route fully recruited, the commercial team is actively preparing for a potential approval and launch by the end of next year. ","Now I\u2019ll turn it back to Paul. ","Paul Friedman ","Okay, thanks Jim. I\u2019ll start with Jakafi. While abstracts for ASCO haven\u2019t been posted, the titles are now public and there is an oral presentation involving Jakafi, entitled \u2018Exploratory Analysis of the Effect of Ruxolitinib on Bone Marrow Morphology in Patients with Myelofibrosis.\u2019 ","The lead author, professor Hans-Michael Kvasnicka, a world recognized hematopathologist from [Agartha] (ph) University, Germany, is exploring the effects of treatment on bone marrow fibrosis in this patient population. ","While it\u2019s not appropriate for me to provide detail about the ASCO presentation, I can tell you that the preliminary findings originally presented by European leukemia net chair, professor Tiziano Barbui, at a closed session of the EON Annual meeting in February, suggests that long term use of Jakafi, slows the rate of advancement of bone marrow fibrosis compared to matched historical controls, and with some patients can result in a reduction in the amount of bone marrow fibrosis. So we\u2019re looking forward to this presentation at ASCO in June. ","Our most advanced programs in Jakafi are in polycythemia vera and pancreatic cancer. We expect to see results from response to PB trial we\u2019re conducting in partnership with Novartis in early \u201814, which keeps us on track to file a supplemental NDA in the first half of \u201814. ","Our second trial in PV called RELIEF is evaluating symptomatic benefit, and while this study is not part of the SPA, the Special Protocol Assessment agreement with the FDA, and is therefore not required for FDA approval. When completed we do plan to submit results to support labeling claims on symptomatic benefit in PV. ","In the second half of this year we expect to have results from recap, the double blind Phase II trial in patients with pancreatic cancer, in which overall survival is the primary endpoint. As we previously mentioned, the trials drug safety and monitoring board conducted a pre specified interim analysis of safety, as well as efficacy at the end of 2012 and recommended that the study continued to completion. ","As there is ample evidence suggesting this regulation of the JAK pathway plays a key role in a variety of malignancies, including solid tumors beyond pancreatic cancer. It\u2019s of interest to evaluate the therapeutic potential of ruxolitinib, as well our other JAK inhibitors in additional malignancies. ","In particular, given the importance of cytotoxic chemotherapy to many first and second lined solid tumor treatment regiments, we\u2019ve initiated an open label Phase I trial of ruxolitinib in combination with chemotherapy, in patients with advanced solid tumors, to better understand the tolerability of ruxolitinib when combined with myelosuppressive agents. From the results anticipated in 2014, we expect to establish the maximum dose of ruxolitinib tolerated when used in combination with given chemotherapeutic regiments. ","Our first proprietary JAK1 inhibitor, INCB39110 is being studied in proof of concept trials in myelofibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis. Results from these trials should help us select the most appropriate indications for further development. We plan to share these results at appropriate scientific meetings in the second half of this year. ","Now we have a second JAK1 inhibitor, INCB47986, which has now entered Phase I clinical development. Having two distinct JAK1 inhibitor compounds gives us a greater number of options with the program, including the opportunity to pursue both oncologic and chronic inflammatory indications, but with distinct molecules. ","We are planning to start a study this summer with one of our JAK1 inhibitors in combination with chemotherapy to better understand how JAK1 inhibitors could be used in this setting and we\u2019re going to be able to compare the results with what we\u2019ve seen with ruxolitinib in a similar patient group. ","Our second JAK 1, JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib, licensed to Lilly, is in Phase III for rheumatoid arthritis. There are also two ongoing Phase II trials evaluating baricitinib as a treatment for psoriasis and for diabetic nephropathy respectively. In addition to our JAK programs, there\u2019s several other compounds in clinical development such as our c-MET inhibitor, as well as an indoleamine dioxygenase or IDO inhibitor. ","The c-MET inhibitor, INCB28060 is licensed to Novartis and they recently initiated a Phase II clinical trial, evaluating the compound as monotherapy in patients with advanced hepatocellular carcinoma. ","Our IDO inhibitor for immunologic treatment of tumors is in Phase II development for melanoma and for ovarian cancer. The results of a Phase I study of the compound will be the subject of poster presentation at ASCO. The program has also generated interest among other researchers, with three investigator sponsor trials being readied for initiation. ","Beyond these programs we have several early stage programs that address attractive oncologic targets, that link well with ruxolitinib and our current development pipeline, and I\u2019d expect to see some of these programs enter the clinic this year and early next year. ","With that operator, lets open the lines for questions please. ","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. (Operator Instructions). Our first question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Roden, your line is live.","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question. ","Do Kim - Piper Jaffray","Hi. This is actually Do Kim in for Ian. A couple of questions; we were wondering if you saw any sense of seasonality in the Jakafi sales number, given the sort of general weakness reported by most of the other pharma and biotech companies and also as we look ahead to the dose titration label update, how should we think about its impact on second half sales in terms of growth persistence and new patient adds? Thank you. ","Paul Friedman","Yes, on the question with respect to seasonality, as you indicated, the first quarter is usually the most difficult for a couple of reasons, particularly from products that are relatively expensive and have a significant percentage of reimbursement through Medicare Part D, because you have patients reentering the donut hole and you have deductibles being reset. ","As we look at the fourth quarter prescriptions and compare them to the first quarter prescription, we probably had a small level of what we call shoebox prescriptions, where patients may try to get their last prescription in December after they are through the donut hole and after their deductible has been fully met, and so there is a slight drop off in the first quarter, but I wouldn\u2019t say it was significant. As you see, our underlying demand remained strong in the first quarter. So I think we were able to power through that. ","The other issue is that we simply had a reduced number of shipping days in the first quarter. The first quarter had 52 shipping days versus 64 in the fourth quarter. But despite that, I think we had a very solid first quarter and we carried good momentum in to the second. ","Regarding the persistence trend and the new patient start trends for the rest of the year, we are not going to quantify those beyond what we said in the prepared remarks, but we are encouraged by the fact that the new patient starts remain strong, consistent with previous quarters, and we are seeing gradual, but important improvement in persistence, and those two drivers give us the confidence that we\u2019ll achieve our guidance for the year. ","Do Kim - Piper Jaffray","Great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question. ","Cory Kasimov - JPMorgan","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking my questions; a couple of them for you. First of all, has been any feedback from the field regarding potential concerns over PML and what would you expect the underlined incidents to be in myelofibrosis, and then I have a follow-up. ","Jim Daly","Hi Cory, this is Jim. Cory, we\u2019ve had zero feedback from the field regarding PML and now I\u2019ll turn it over to...","Paul Friedman","Yes Rich, I don\u2019t think you can put a percentage on it. It\u2019s a rare enough entity that in Myelofibrosis and Myeloproliferative Neoplasms, its just, I don\u2019t think you can put a percentage on. ","Rich Levy","It\u2019s hard to do. I mean when we look back at the FDA database from several years ago, there were a number of different drugs that were looked at and there were more cases than you might expect. But when you look at the literature, and when you know that there is going to be under reporting, even for things like PML. ","So it\u2019s hard to say exactly. But it\u2019s not going to be a big number, spontaneous or with the use of a drug, but it\u2019s also not to say that you would never expect another one to happen, even in the absence of the drug. ","Cory Kasimov - JP Morgan ","Okay. And then next question is just more on the relative breakdown in the Jakafi doses being used. So it\u2019s encouraging that the 5 and 10 mg doses continue to increase. But I\u2019m wonder, is there any pushback at all on using those lower does. I guess I want to get your sense on if we should expect that 44% shortage you have now to keep growing and become in time, kind of represent the vast majority of initial prescriptions. Thanks. ","Paul Friedman","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t necessarily say initial Cory. Whether it\u2019s starting dose and\/or titration, we do expect the 5 and 10 to increase as a share of total doses. So we would expect to see that 44% grow over time. ","Cory Kasimov - JP Morgan ","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS. Please proceed with your question. ","Matthew Roden - UBS","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Congrats on the progress and thanks for getting me back in here. I just wanted to get into the gross net a little bit. I\u2019m trying to better understand what the potential impact or the financial impact was of the donut hole in particular. ","And also in inventories you talk about, inventory accounted for 3% of the sequential growth, but I\u2019m just trying to understand if that represents a build or if that\u2019s just the growth that\u2019s commensurate with the growth in demand, underlying demand, and then I have a pipeline question if I may. ","Dave Hastings","On the gross to net, as we discussed on the prepared remarks, came in at about 9.5%, but the guidance overall did not change. So our gross net for the year should range somewhere between 8% and 9%. So that should give you a sense for the impact on the increased donut hole exposure for the quarter. The inventory are at normal levels, so it\u2019s really commensurate with the growth in product sales. ","Matthew Roden - UBS","Okay, understood. And then on the pipeline, Paul or Rich, can you speak to the differences between your two JAK1 inhibitors? Is there something really different between these two products that you would need to bring sort of complementary assets for those or just the question of being or to cover more indications across cancer and information? ","Paul Friedman","Well, so they are different in terms of, they have a distinct pharmacokinetic difference and I just would like to leave it at that. ","The first compound has turned out to be much more interesting than I frankly thought it was going to be. It\u2019s a very nice compound, and we are looking forward to presenting our results on that compound and the three indications at which we are looking at the second half of the year. ","We did with JAK1, JAK2 want and I think it turned out to be the right way to go, to have a distinct compound for inflammatory diseases and one for oncologic indications and that resulted in Ruxolitinib and Baricitinib and we are taking the same approach here. But the second compound, it\u2019s early days and I just don\u2019t think I can say much more than that. ","Rich, do you have anything else to add to that? ","Rich Levy","No. ","Matthew Roden - UBS","Thanks a lot. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please proceed with our question. ","Heather Behanna - JMP Securities","Hi, good morning. It\u2019s Heather in for Liisa. Just a quick question; if you could give us any more color just sort of about how persistence rates have continued over time and just give us a little more color on new patients versus continuing patients. ","Paul Friedman","I can\u2019t give you much more color than what we give you in the prepared comments. Our best quantification of persistence right now is seen in our ability to drive titration and use of lower doses and we are seeing that happening. Again, our new patient starts a very consistent. ","As we have communicated previously, we do expect to see a very modest deceleration in new patient starts, more weighted towards the back end of the year than the front-end of the year, and we do expect to see a modest, but important increase in persistence over the course of the year and that\u2019s really exactly what we are seeing. That takes us into our guidance to 210 to 225. ","Heather Behanna - JMP Securities","Okay, great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo"," Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a good quarter. Given the recent rejection of zelgen in Europe, I was wondering if you and your partner had any changes to the way you might approach the development of Baricitinib. Any tweaks you might make to the development program? And how confident are you in the differentiation of baricitinib from zelgens, such that you don\u2019t believe you would necessarily fall into the same pitfalls that they did. And I have a quick follow-up. ","Paul Friedman","So, this is Paul and then I\u2019ll ask Rich to add anything that he thinks I didn\u2019t cover or didn\u2019t make clear enough and I really think at the end of the day, the question is best posed to Lilly, but we certainly can pine on it and there is some very important aspects to the question that you asked. ","In particular, we all listened to the advisory committee that was conducted with Pfizer, and based on what we learned during that, and knowing what Pfizer\u2019s Phase III study was, we used the learning\u2019s from the Pfizer structure study to do a couple of things. ","One is to increase the sample size, and the second, very importantly, was to enrich for patients more at risk in the RA population for structural deterioration in the absence of effective treatment. And so we, and I believe Lilly remained quite confident in the ability to demonstrate an improvement in structure in the target population. ","Beyond that, and I think importantly, although the proof will be in the pudding when Phase III is complete or that the Phase II data with baricitinib, it\u2019s a JAK inhibitor that spares JAK 3 in contrast to tofacitinib. The Phase II has not been associated with opportunistic interactions, other than a few cases of uncomplicated zoster, shingles for example or with malignancies. ","And while the Phase III data will be important to confirm this profile, we may well see a better risk benefit profile than we have seen with tofacitinib. And so we remain confident in the potential approval for Baricitinib for RA in the EU, as well as in the United States and around the world. Rich. ","Rich Levy","Yes, the only thing I\u2019d add is, I think that because tofacitinib is going to potentially be approved with the 5-milligram dose and not the 10, and they had their positive structure data at 10, I think that also had an effect. ","And with respect to Baricitinib, the 4-milligram dose, it was at the top dose that Lilly is studying, is looking really good, looked really good in Phase II from a safety perspective, as well as from and efficacy perspective. They have MRI data, even though they haven\u2019t had x-ray data to support that it was going to have effects on bone. They have that data from their MRI studies. ","So as Paul said, we think it\u2019s going to be safe enough to have the top doses go through, and that should with the enhanced design of the structure study come out positive. So I think in some ways we are looking at this as an opportunity. ","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","That\u2019s very helpful, thanks. And then just one quick follow-up and I\u2019ll hop back into queue. With the trials, the Phase II for 110 and continuing to move along, can you give us any more clarity on which of those trial readouts we might expect in the back half of this year? Thanks. ","Paul Friedman","Yes. So the psoriasis study may very well get presented at EADV, I think which is in October in Istanbul I believe. The rheumatoid arthritis data may very well get presented at ACR, and the myelofibrosis data may very well get presented at ASH. But all of those, none of them have been \u2013 either some of them have not even been submitted yet and others have not heard back until they\u2019ll be accepted for presentation. Should any of those not happen, we\u2019ll think about backup plans or potentially just top line fairly than otherwise expected. ","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Canaccord. Please proceed with your question. ","Andrew Jappy - Canaccord","Hi, this is Andrew on the line for Salveen. My question is on the pancreatic cancer, kind of how we should think about the expectations there, and what you need to see in that trial to maybe get a label expansion. If there\u2019s any significant improvement in OS that would be necessary or would you need to go to Phase III. Thanks. ","Paul Friedman","Okay. So the study was designed as clearly a Phase II study, one that where we did not have expectations, but this study by itself would lead to any type of approval, accelerated or otherwise. In pancreatic cancer would be the idea of being that we\u2019d mostly likely need to go Phase III. ","Is there a possibility that the results could be so robust that we might actually approach FDA, trying to get an accelerated approval on this, based on a commitment to do a second study later? Its possible, but I wouldn\u2019t suggest that that\u2019s our expectation. ","And in terms of things like what does the hazard ratio need to be, it has to be in a range where we feel comfortable that it\u2019s worth doing another study, that wouldn\u2019t be so large, and I think there\u2019s a good chance that that will be the case. But in terms of a hazard ratio that would be necessary for FDA to consider this as a basis of approval by itself, I really wouldn\u2019t want to try to predict that. ","Things are changing a little bit. At FDA, there\u2019s more emphasis on breakthrough drugs. The oncology divisions have been calling a lot of things, breakthrough drugs lately, so I don\u2019t know that you can necessarily just go on past experience, given the changes that are going on down there right now. ","Andrew Jappy - Canaccord","Okay, great. Thank you very much. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays. Please proceed with your question. ","Christina Zhang \u2013 Barclays","Hi, this is Christina on behalf of Ying Huang. I know you mentioned that you are planning to net the RA data for your preparatory JAK 110, potentially at ACR. But I just wanted to see if there was any more data on the 12 design, given that I didn\u2019t see it listed on criticaltrials.gov, but I did see the MSN psoriasis trails on there. Thanks. ","Paul Friedman","I\u2019m pretty sure it has to be on clinicaltrials.gov, I just don\u2019t know what the \u2013 right now we\u2019d initially done some one-month data, which was kind of an accelerating dosing paradigm with a few placebo patients included. Once we got toxicology data to be able to allow us to do three months, we are now doing parallel groups of, I believe three or four different doses plus placebo. ","The study is not big by any means. These are not meant to be studies that would go directly to Phase III, but they gives us a real sense of what the drug does in this indication, in the sense of the doses that may be necessary in a variety of anti-inflammatory indications. ","And it\u2019s a three 12-week readout not as apposed to the one-week readout we had before. And I expect that if this was to be accepted for presentation at ACR, we would present both, the results of the one-month data, as well as the updated three-month data. ","Christina Zhang \u2013 Barclays","Great. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Thanks for taking my questions. Intrigue by Rich\u2019s comment, that the Phase II pancreatic trial has a good chance of producing a good enough hazard ratio to go to Phase III and also I guess about your decision to start the gem\/abraxane combo study ahead of reporting out the Phase II data. What do you guys know or see about the Phase 2 trial? ","Rich Levy","Maybe I misheard you or maybe you misheard me. I said I didn\u2019t think there was a good chance that the data would be strong enough to go directly to a registration, just because its a small study, it\u2019s a 135 patients. ","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","But Rich, I thought you said it would be most likely supportive of a Phase III trial, based on the Phase II showing a good enough hazard ratio. ","Rich Levy","That\u2019s not based on data. I think the rationale that we\u2019ve had all along has been a good one, and what I was trying to say is that one of the considerations would be how large the study would need to be in order to go to Phase III, depending upon the hazard ratio that we actually see. ","All we know in terms of data is that it past the futility analysis, which means that the study had at least 30% power after that analysis. And so now that I\u2019ve clarified that, can you remind me what you\u2019re specific question was?","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","That\u2019s what I wanted to know. I guess that you don\u2019t see the data and you don\u2019t have any other knowledge than what the DSLV elected to do. ","Rich Levy","That\u2019s correct. ","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Okay. And then as a second question, maybe for Jim, on the potential impact from this new dose titration program, is it possible we would see negative sales impact in Q2 as more patients select the free few weeks of drug? ","Jim Daly ","No. We don\u2019t anticipate any negative revenue impact. If anything Eric, I think you\u2019ll see a positive revenue impact longer-term. We just implemented and in the past several weeks, but we are seeing good activity, but we don\u2019t anticipate any negative revenue impact from it. ","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Okay, thanks. And then last question for Dave if I may, it looks like you saw 4% pricing benefit last quarter from the November price hike, another 2% this quarter, adding up to maybe 6%. Is that all we are going to see as the 9% hike? Are you going to basically recognize about two-thirds of that or is there more to come? ","Dave Hastings ","Well, I think that\u2019s basically it, right? I mean that will be fully baked in going forward at this point, Eric. ","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","So in general for your price hikes, we should assume about two-thirds will be realized? ","Paul Friedman","Lets have that one back. If the price increased November 16, absent any increase in gross to net, we would have realized a 5% price increase in the quarter. ","Dave Hastings ","Yes, the 2% is that and net of the gross in that impact there. ","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Okay, so we probably will see a little more price hike, because you don\u2019t have the same gross to net in Q2. ","Dave Hastings","That\u2019s correct. ","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question. ","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes, I have two questions. As we go into ASCO, I wanted to try to pick your brain Rich or Paul on how to think about the fibrosis remodeling data that we\u2019re going to see for Jakafi. ","A couple of years ago there was no improvement in fibrosis and that was considered a bad thing and now that we are seeing it, there is some discussion about, oh I\u2019m not sure how it matters, because fibrosis is not correlated to survival outcomes. So it seems like a circular argument to me, but I wanted to pick your brain on that. ","And then just secondarily, just going back to the JAK1 inhibitor for a minute, you said before that its got to be differentiated from Baricitinib, in order for you to really invest in two inflammatory programs, and I wanted to again get your sense of, is that the proof that you are seeing. Is there something that\u2019s differentiated enough or we should expect the JAK1 inhibitor to be further developed in RA beyond just the Phase II? Thank you.","Paul Friedman","Okay. So first on this fibrosis. I mean in the past what we have seen was that we were not seeing a lot of reversal of fibrosis. As you can see, if you do a bone marrow transplant and then within six months to a year, you can often see less fiber in the marrow. ","So it\u2019s really only when you got to compare to a matched historical control of patients who had received HU, that we realize the main finding is that you are seeing less progression. It\u2019s progressing more slowly than that much control, and also that there are some patients and I can\u2019t release the percentage of patients that actually had decreases in the amount of fibrosis in the marrow. ","So is that a game changer? I don\u2019t really think so. I mean, as you said, I don\u2019t know that that changes the view on \u2013 we know we have data out there saying there\u2019s an improvement in survival. It was dependent or independent of fibrosis, not sure it really makes a difference there. ","But I think that probably some physicians out there that would be swayed by that sort of data that may have not been swayed by survival from studies that were not exactly planned around survival and that symptoms was one thing, maybe there will be some patients, maybe some physicians will start patients who are not as symptomatic, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a game changer by any means and we can talk about it more when the data is actually presented. ","With respect to the second question on differentiation, I mean it\u2019s not just a question of differentiated from Baricitinib. It\u2019s a question of differentiation from the range of new competitors that may exist at the time, and so we are not going to get into what we may or may not know about our results at this time. We are saving that until we have more complete data and give some of those presentations at the meetings I talked about earlier, in both psoriasis and RA on the inflammation side. ","But I will say that these are large investments and to bring these drugs to markets for these indications and I would not see us going forward just to have a late entry need to. So they would need to be some level of differentiation. ","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","And just one quick one for me. Assume that PML is not going to be reported in the FDA label for Jakafi. Have you had your discussions with regulatory agencies, and that\u2019s just not an issue? ","Paul Friedman","We\u2019ve actually proposed, mention of PML in the package insert. I\u2019m not going to get into exactly where and how, and FDA has verbally been very much in agreement with what we had proposed. But they still haven\u2019t made a final decision; maybe it needs to go up to other levels before it finally gets decided. ","And we\u2019re not going to try to speculate exactly what that is, but since we\u2019ve actually proposed something there, I can give you a clear view that there will be something there, because they are not going to say don\u2019t put anything in. ","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Right. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Friedman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question. ","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks for taking the question. It\u2019s just around the volume growth that you guys had this quarter. It looks like if I calculate, it was about 3 million of sort of organic volume growth, which is about half of what you guys reported last quarter and if this is the new steady-state, it puts you at the bottom end of guidance. So I guess I\u2019m just wondering what you think is going to change this year to reaccelerate the volume growth and the organic growth that puts you above that bottom end.","Jim Daly ","Hi David, this is Jim. David I would be very careful drawing a trend line from fourth quarter to first quarter. Because as we mentioned earlier, you can\u2019t see some additional sales at end of the fourth quarter, and it\u2019s generally as you\u2019ve seen for the industry, it\u2019s a pretty difficult comparison, fourth quarter versus first quarter. ","Having said that, we remain very confident in our guidance, and quite frankly I think, let me send you right there, we remain very confident in $210 million and $225 million this year. ","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Skip Klein with Gauss Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Skip Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors","Great, thank you. I was wondering if you could give a little bit of an update on the competitive environment, what\u2019s going on at the Galapagos still where the Jakarta study stands? ","Paul Friedman","So at Galapagos they\u2019ve announced they are I think doing 875 patients in Phase II, which is a very large Phase II program, which indicates that data has not yet been presented, but might be presented at UR for example, on their second one month study, with positive enough for them and have we to decide to continue to invest in this program, but in the absence of data, I can\u2019t comment further. ","With respect to Sanofi and their JAK2 inhibitor in myelofibrosis, I mean we\u2019ve never been that impressed with their Phase II data, in the sense that they had a fair amount of GI intolerance, not like its grade three or four GI intolerance, but why would you want to have that sort of profile when you don\u2019t need to; Jakafi does not have that. ","Secondly, with the doses that they studied in the past they\u2019ve had even more anemia than our higher doses. So we recognize clearly that they are going to be coming out there with strategies and strategies of looking at so called Ruxolitinib or Jakafi failures, if such a thing actually exists. But I think once we actually see the data and then they actually have to promote on label, we don\u2019t really see a tremendous threat from them, but again we haven\u2019t seen the Phase III data. ","Skip Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors","And then still at YM, if you would? ","Paul Friedman","So that one still remains many years behind. We estimated its probably \u2013 I think we estimated it would probably be in late \u201815 or early \u2018\u20186 launch and they said that they would be starting Phase III in the second half of this year, which is coming up in a few months and it\u2019s been pretty much radio silence in terms of anything there. ","We think that that drug is not going to have some sort of magical effect on anemia that you don\u2019t see by just simply reducing the dose of ruxolitinib to about 10 milligrams twice a day and they do have some side effects that we don\u2019t have. But we\u2019ll get closer to it, when they are actually about three years and see where we stand. ","Skip Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors","Great. Thanks and then one quick follow-up. I didn\u2019t get an invitation, but is it possible that you have some champagne to celebrate the 4000 unique patients being put on drug, being put on Jakafi and\/or the fact that you looked like you might have been positive cash flow in the quarter after adjusting for options and non-cash interest expense? Just questions you know, yes or no. 4000 patients look like they\u2019ve been put on drug, chemo I believe and it looks like your project is cash flow, but I\u2019m an old, tired analyst. ","Paul Friedman","One thing to keep in mind as you are looking at new patients being put on drug, about 10% of our patients are put on drugs through our patient access program. So as you are doing your models, I think that may be a factor that you want to keep in mind as well. ","Dave Hastings","And Skip we do have multiple sources of cash flow, so we appreciate you acknowledging that. We are in good shape from the cash position. ","Skip Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors","So you have positive cash flow. I mean once you adjust for option expense and I don\u2019t know what you are spending on capital spending, but that\u2019s good, you\u2019re turning the corner. Which is bottom line, 4000 patients, whether they got free drugs or not have been put on this drug. ","Paul Friedman","Yes, we are really not commenting on a specific number of patients on the product Skip. ","Skip Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors","Okay. So you didn\u2019t open a bottle of champagne in the quarter. Okay, thanks a lot. Bye-bye. ","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Lazard Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. ","Josh Schimmer - Lazard Capital Markets","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Two of them quickly, will you announce if and when any additional PML events occur on Jakafi or once that\u2019s in the label, do you not feel like you need to spread or update the Street. ","And second, Jim maybe you can provide a little bit of color on the progress that you are making or establishing; Incyte\u2019s standing in the MF community, either funding research conferences, other activities that reach beyond kind of the cornerstone and how that\u2019s been evolving over the course of this year. Thanks.","Jim Daly","So with respect to PML, I mean it kind of depends. We see an increase, we see something that is beyond what we\u2019ve already seen, such as we say now we have won about 10,000 cases. If that was to go up, then I think we\u2019d probably say something. If there is another 10,000 patients on drugs, exposed to the drug before you see another one, then we probably wouldn\u2019t. ","So it\u2019s really a change in the view of the risk of the drug that I think would really result in that and that probably would also be the same approach to potential changes in labeling beyond that. ","And can you repeat the second question about\u2026 ","Paul Friedman ","The second question was more directed towards me Josh, regarding what progress are we making to develop our relationships with key opinion leaders, and Josh I think that\u2019s one where its more productive to actually keep your head down and do the work rather than commenting on it on too frequent a basis, but obviously we have a long-term commitment to heal malignancy. ","Jakafi is obviously the cornerstone, but as you hear more about our pipeline. We intend to be working very closely with these physicians, these oncology academic medical centers, with the societies on a long-term basis and clearly we are making the commitment to establish Incyte as really a scientific driver in this field. ","Josh Schimmer - Lazard Capital Markets","Great. Thanks very much. ","Operator","Our final question comes from the line of Boris Peaker with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with you question. ","Matt Palmer \u2013 Oppenheimer","Good morning. This is Matt Palmer in for Boris. Thanks for taking the question. Two quick ones actually; how significant will label expansion be for low platelet patients on your target prescriber penetration or do you expect label expansion to have a significant effect on the current prescriber usage? ","Jim Daly ","This is Jim. I think it will have a positive effect on both. We still have a significant number of new patient starts, where those patients have a baseline platelet count below 100,000, and I think the expanded label well help greatly with those. ","I also think that there will probably be some spillover on the anemia side, which is if you manage Thrombocytopenia with a start low and go slow approach, it\u2019s not a huge leap of faith for doctors to assume that that\u2019s a logical approach for patients with low hemoglobin as well. So, I think there will be a dual benefit both for new prescribers and current prescribers, but I think it will also extend beyond Thrombocytopenia to benefit anemia as well. ","Matt Palmer \u2013 Oppenheimer","Great, thank you. And secondly, you mentioned R&D was a little bit below expectations in the quarter. Should we expect some of these expenses to be shifted into the second quarter or later into the year? ","Dave Hastings ","Yes, it was all timing. ","Matt Palmer \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay, great, Thanks. ","Operator","Dr. Friedman, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the floor back over to you for closing comments. ","Paul Friedman ","Well, thank you and thank you all for your questions and for dialing in and listening today, and we look forward to providing you with further progress as we move forward.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Booth, Investor Relations for Incyte. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Booth","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's fourth quarter and year end 2017 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com. And I'm joined today on the call by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Steven, Dave, and Reid.","Before we begin, I\u2019d like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2018 guidance, the commercialization of our products, and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline, as well as the development plans for our collaboration partners.","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, included those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2017 and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents.","I'd now like to pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for his introductory remarks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone, thank you for attending this call. So there are really three themes to discuss on today's call. First is Jakafi commercialization plan, and the near-term [indiscernible] that we expect and our decision to report after non-GAAP accounting measure starting in Q1 2018.","So first, the number of patients taking Jakafi continues to grow very nicely, and Jakafi net sales for the full year were close to the upper end of our guidance range. As we told you last quarter, Jakafi sales in Q3 included some inventory build, and this has now been corrected in Q4. And Barry will speak about this in more detail later.","Steven will cover our four upcoming clinical and regulatory, capabilities, its Jakafi in GVHD, FGFR in cholangiocarcinoma, baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis and the ECHO-301 trial with epacadostat in advanced melanoma. You will also see that our SG&A guidance for 2018 includes an estimate of our global prelaunch costs for epacadostat. Dave will also cover our decision to adopt non-GAAP accounting measures and detail our framework for what will be included and excluded from these figures.","Okay, so with that preamble, let me say a few words about the significant progress we made over the course of the last 12 months. In 2016, we surpassed $1 billion in total revenue for the first time, while this year, we surpassed $1.5 billion in total annual revenue, representing growth of almost 40%.","Using the graphic of Slide 4, I'd like to highlight 5 areas we believe to be crucial to the successful and - to a successful and growing biopharmaceutical company. Each of these areas are important and contribute to our long-term success in a different way.","First, the dynamic top line supporting our future growth objective; then an expanding number of different sources of product-related revenue; the breadth of our clinical development portfolio; adding to our discovery capabilities; and obviously, the geographic reach of our organization.","You can see the total revenue growth of 2017, we progressed in each of these area, notably the total revenue growth were a record level, but we added another an additional source of royalty revenue with release, ex-U.S., launch of Olumiant.","We have also added two clinical candidates to our later-stage development portfolio, and we added an additional drug discovery platform with our bispecific collaboration with Merus.","2017 also saw Incyte establish a footprint in Japan as we rounded out our geographic expansion. I believe that we are now in an excellent position to execute on our upcoming development and commercialization plan.","On Slide 5, you see our strong growth in product-related revenue comes from 4 sources: sales from Jakafi, sales from Iclusig and royalties from both Jakavi and Olumiant. Barry will discuss Jakafi in a few minutes and Steven will provide a quick update on Olumiant. So let me briefly touch on Iclusig.","We are pleased that that Iclusig sales have not only supported our rationale to invest in Europe, but it's also fair to say that sales are growing more rapidly than we have initially expected.","In Q4, for example, sales of Iclusig grew at 51% over the same period last year, and I believe that this speaks to the quality of our European organization and should bode well for the future.","In addition, for the year, we have recognized $152 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis, representing 37% growth over last year and adding significantly to our top line momentum.","Slide 6 illustrates the growth in our development portfolio and emphasizes our later-stage candidates. Since last year, we have progressed itacitinib, our JAK1 selective inhibitor and added MGA012, the PD-1 antagonist, into our later-stage portfolio.","We also worked hard to expand the development scope of our existing portfolio candidate. And as you can see on the right-hand side of Slide 6, we have moved many of them into trials in multiple additional indications.","So I'd like to finish by segment with what makes Incyte a special place to work and why we are so excited about the years ahead. Incyte is not only a company of rapid revenue growth, as seen by the almost 40% growth in our top line, but it is also a company with an expanding portfolio and with enhanced discovery capabilities.","As illustrated on the right-hand side of Slide 7, we have a multitude of opportunity as we seek to transform Incyte into a sustainably profitable biopharmaceutical business over the next several years. We now have more than 1,200 employees across the U.S., Europe and Japan, and our balance sheet has been greatly improved with the retirement of over $700 million of convertible debt and with a balance of cash and equivalent of $1.2 million.","We therefore believe that we have both the geographic reach, the financial resources to be able to bring our new therapies to patients that need them.","With that, I'll pass the call to Barry for an update on Jakafi.","Barry Flannelly","Thank you, Herv\u00e9. And good morning, everyone. Three charts on Slide 9 are intended to give you the full picture of current Jakafi trends. Our Jakafi business grew very well in the fourth quarter, as measured by the continued and consistent growth in patient demand as shown in the figure on the left side of Slide 9.","Total patients on Jakafi are up 22% over the same period last year. Reported net Jakafi revenues were $302 million, up 27% from Q4 of last year. Net sales in Q4 were impacted by a reduction in inventory held by distributors.","As you recall, we exited the third quarter with inventory build and we exited the fourth quarter back in the normal range of inventory. This correction in inventory amounts to approximately half a week of product held at distributors, which equals approximately $12 million of Jakafi net sales.","The right-hand panel plots Jakafi net sales by 6-month periods. This washes out these quarter-to-quarter inventory fluctuations and provides a normalized picture of Jakafi growth. Jakafi sales in the second half of 2017 were 31% higher than the same period last year.","Slide 10 illustrates the annual revenue progression of Jakafi over the last 6 years, which shows remarkable trend of strong growth. For the full year 2017, Jakafi net sales grew to $1,133,000,000, a 33% increase over the full year in 2016.","We are also seeing strong and consistent growth in a number of patients on therapy, and the chart on the right of the slide shows this annual growth very clearly. We estimate that there were approximately 11,000 patients taking Jakafi in the United States during the fourth quarter of last year.","The largest of proportion of patients taking Jakafi have myelofibrosis, but the proportion with polycythemia vera continues to rise. And as the PV proportion in the patient mix rises, so does persistency, which of course has a positive effect on revenue.","Today we announced our net product revenue guidance for Jakafi for 2018, which we expect to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion, the midpoint of which represents more than 20% growth over 2017.","Based on strong demand for Jakafi, the continued appreciation in the medical community that earlier intervention leads to better patient outcomes and increasing persistency, we have recently raised our long-term net product revenue guidance to a range of $2.5 billion to $3 billion.","This long-term guidance includes the potential for new indications, including GVHD, which Steven will address next.","Steven Stein","Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. Before coming to Jakafi in graft-versus-host disease, I'd like to begin by reminding everyone of our development portfolio. Herv\u00e9 highlighted our 6 later-stage product candidates that have progressed beyond proof-of-concept development.","But it's important to remember that we also have earlier-stage product candidates against 10 discrete targets, the majority of which have been created by in-house efforts and through our discovery alliances.","The three candidates, which are expected to enter the clinic this year, are examples of that. The antibodies against TIM-3 and LAG-3 come from our discovery alliance with Agenus, whereas the dual AXL\/MER inhibitor is the product of a 3-year effort from our world-class medicinal chemistry team.","So back to Jakafi in graft-versus-host disease, and a reminder that the first pivotal trial for Jakafi in graft-versus-host disease is expected to read out in the first half of this year. REACH1 is a single-arm trial in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease. And if the trial is successful, we expect to submit a supplemental NDA later this year.","The incidence of graft-versus-host disease has been growing due to an increase in the number of allogeneic transplants. Unfortunately, approximately 50% of these transplant patients develop graft-versus-host disease, and mortality rates in GVHD patients can be very high. In the first year, mortality rates can be between 25% and 75%, depending on the grade. So the unmet need here is very clear.","A few words next on the ECHO-301 trial, evaluating epacadostat in combination with pembro in advanced or metastatic melanoma. As you should all know, the ECHO-301 trial is fully enrolled and we are expecting the PFS results in the first half of this year.","We are already planning our global prelaunch activities for later this year, and pending the PFS results, of course, intend to submit an NDA seeking approval of epacadostat in the second half of 2018.","Melanoma is a sizable opportunity for us, with over 20,000 metastatic melanoma patients in the U.S., Europe and Japan each year. It is important to note that PD-1 monotherapy is the standard of care for first-line melanoma.","Let's move on to our FGFR1\/2\/3 inhibitor. FIGHT-202, our study of patients with cholangiocarcinoma has been enrolling very well and we expect to be able to present initial data from the study this year.","The trial has 3 open-label arms. Group A is recruiting 100 cholangiocarcinoma patients with FGFR2 translocations. And it is these patients where we expect to see the benefits of 54828. Recruitment of the 20 patients needed in each of the other 2 arms has been completed, and we expect these arms to act as negative internal controls in the study.","If the study meets its primary endpoint for the good durability of response, we expect to submit an NDA seeking approval of 54828 in cholangio patients with FGFR2 translocations. Cholangiocarcinoma is an orphan indication and has significant unmet need. In the second-line setting, post first-line chemotherapy, overall response rates to second line therapy are approximately 10% with only a 2-month progression-free survival.","I'll finish with a quick update on baricitinib. Lilly confirmed in December last year that it had resubmitted the rheumatoid arthritis NDA, which the FDA subsequently accepted as a Class II resubmission. This results in a review time of 6 months, during which we and Lilly expect the FDA to call an advisory committee to discuss the data publicly.","Beyond rheumatoid arthritis, Lilly has already initiated a Phase III program of baricitinib in atopic dermatitis and expects to initiate a Phase III program in psoriatic arthritis later this year. Lastly, Lilly has also stated that the results from the Phase II trial of baricitinib in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus are expected to be presented at a medical meeting later this year.","With that, I'll pass the call to Dave for the financial update.","David Gryska","Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Our financial performance for the fourth quarter was very strong. We recorded $444 million of total revenue. This was comprised of $302 million Jakafi net product revenue, $19 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $48 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis, $5 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly and $70 million in milestone revenue.","For 2017, we recorded $1.5 billion of total revenue. This was comprised of $1.1 billion of Jakafi net product revenue, $67 million of Iclusig net product revenue, $152 million of Jakavi royalties from Novartis, $9 million of Olumiant royalties from Lilly and $175 million in milestone revenue.","Our gross net adjustment for Jakafi for 2017 was approximately 13%. Our cost of product revenue for the quarter and the full year was $22 million and $79 million respectively.","Our R&D expense for the quarter was comprised of $297 million of ongoing R&D expense and $150 million upfront payment under the license agreement with MacroGenics for a total R&D expense of $447 million, which includes $23 million in non-stock \u2013 non-cash stock compensation.","Our R&D expense for the full year was comprised of $955 million of ongoing R&D expense, $12 million related to a in-process R&D asset impairment, and approximately $359 million in upfront consideration and milestone expenses related to our collaboration agreements, for total R&D expense of $1.3 billion, including $90 million in non-cash stock compensation.","Our SG&A expense for the quarter and the full year was $98 million and $366 million, respectively, including $11 million and $43 million in non-cash stock compensation for the quarter and full year, respectively.","For our expense related to the change in fair market value with contingent consideration for Iclusig royalty liability for the quarter, we recorded $10 million and $8 million, respectively.","Moving on to nonoperating expenses. We recorded a $22 million unrealized loss on our long-term investments in Merus and Agenus for the quarter, and $24 million unrealized loss on these same investments for the full year.","Our net loss for the quarter and the full year was $150 million and $133 million, respectively. Recall, these amounts include expenses related to our collaboration agreements of $150 million for the fourth quarter and $359 million for the full year.","Looking at the balance sheet, we ended the year with $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities.","To summarize, we're extremely pleased with the performance in 2017. Jakafi delivered strong revenue growth. We ended the year on a strong cash position. We retired over $700 million of debt from our balance sheet.","We entered into development agreements with Calithera and MacroGenics, which added to our already extensive product pipeline, and we continue to make significant advancements in our clinical development programs.","Before moving on to 2018 guidance, I'd like to briefly discuss the impact of the recent passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on our business. We expect significant reductions to our future tax liabilities after we have fully utilized our net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards.","Given our geographic mix of income, such as Jakafi U.S. revenue, Jakavi ex-U.S. royalties and our [Swiss tax filing], we estimate our long-term effective tax rate for GAAP and non-GAAP will be in the range of 17% to 18%.","Beginning in 2018, we'll include non-GAAP financial metrics in our financial disclosure. We believe this will provide useful information for understanding our ongoing business performance and align us with our industry peers. On the next slide, I'll detail the specific non-GAAP adjustments that Incyte intends to make on a go-forward basis.","Our non-GAAP financial results will exclude the impact of the following: certain items related to our collaboration agreements, such as milestone revenue, upfront consideration and milestone expense; and changes in the fair market value of equity investments.","For example, the milestones recognized from Novartis and Lilly will be excluded; non-cash stock compensation; certain impacts of purchase accounting, such as the amortization of product rights and changes in the fair market value of contingent consideration.","For example, the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration and the amortization of acquired product rights related to Iclusig product acquisition will be excluded; and other items, such as non-cash interest expense, non-routine items and the tax effect of non-GAAP adjustments. Going forward, you will always be able to refer to our 8-K and earnings release for a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP items.","The numbers I previously discussed relating to our 2017 performance were GAAP numbers. If we were to apply these non-GAAP adjustments to the quarter and the full year 2017 income statements, non-GAAP net income would be $4 million for the quarter and non-GAAP net income will be $131 million for the full-year.","Moving on to 2018, I'll now discuss the key components of our 2018 guidance on both a GAAP and non-GAAP basis to assist in our transition. Please note that the guidance we provided today does not include any potential future strategic transactions beyond the agreements previously announced.","For the full year 2018, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP net product revenue from Jakafi to be in the range of $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion. For Iclusig, we expect GAAP and non-GAAP net product revenue to be in the range of $80 million to $85 million. We will not be providing guidance from milestone or royalty revenue from Lilly or Novartis.","We expect our gross net adjustment for 2018 to be approximately 14% for Jakafi. We expect GAAP cost of product revenues to be in the range of $85 million and $95 million, and non-GAAP cost of product revenues to be in the range of $64 million to $74 million.","The GAAP cost of product revenues includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payments of royalties to Novartis on U.S. Jakafi net sales and the amortization of acquired product rights relating to Iclusig product acquisition. On a non-GAAP basis, we'll exclude the amortization of acquired product rights related to the Iclusig product acquisition.","We expect GAAP R&D expense to be in the range of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. This includes stock-based compensation of $110 million to $115 million and a $13 million upfront consideration related to the Syros collaboration agreement.","On a non-GAAP basis, we'll exclude stock compensation and the upfront consideration related to the Syros collaboration. Therefore on a non-GAAP basis, we expect R&D expense to be in the range of $1,077,000,000 to $1,172,000,000.","On an adjusted basis, our increase in R&D year-over-year is largely driven by the advancement of epacadostat Phase III studies, our portion of the expense for new studies and additional indications for baricitinib, advancement of the Phase III study of itacitinib in GVHD, and the advancement of our other compounds in development.","We expect SG&A expense to be in range of $515 million to $534 million. This includes approximately $125 million of epacadostat prelaunch expenses, which we expect to incur in the second half of the year. This will also include stock-based compensation of approximately $50 million to $55 million.","On a non-GAAP basis, we'll exclude the stock compensation and, therefore, on a non-GAAP basis, we expect SG&A expense to be in a range of $465 million to $480 million.","Adjusting for the epacadostat prelaunch expenses of $125 million, our 2018 SG&A guidance is a modest increase over 2017 actual SG&A expense. We expect the change in the fair market value of contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability to be approximately $30 million on a GAAP basis, and we'll remove this entire amount on a non-GAAP basis. Lastly, we expect to end the year with approximately the same level of cash and marketable securities compared to our current balance.","Operator, this concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open up the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today's coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is alive.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. This is actually Kerry on the line. Congrats on the progress. Just have a few questions. First, in terms of the model, in first quarter Jakafi sales, should we anticipate any deviation from the usual seasonal inventory and donut hole impact on sales?","And then just in terms of SG&A, I know there's a significant jump related to the epacadostat prelaunch part. Can you give us some more details on the breakdown of where this is going?","Barry Flannelly","Yes, so this is Barry. So as far as Q1, yes, you'll see the impact, certainly of the donut hole. So our gross to net will be at the highest point in Q1 or beginning of Q1 as compared to the rest of the year.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Let's speak about the launch cost for epacadostat on the SG&A number for next year. So the way it will work is that we will have an expansion of our commercial team both in the U.S. and Europe, because that's the 2 areas where we will have the first launches. Japan will come later, and it's -- melanoma is a fairly small opportunity in Japan. We will have an increase of our activities with medical affairs, so there is a number of medical affairs infrastructure and cost that would be incurred in this one half of the year related to the launch.","And then there are a few other things in terms of expanding in some countries in Europe that will be also necessary. I mean, the way you can think about it is that the timing is such that if we have a submission in the second half of the year, we will have an approval, let's say, somewhere early maybe in the U.S. and a little later in Europe in 2019. And that's what we are getting competitively prepared for in the second half of 2018. So the calibration of $125 million is based on the current plan that we have.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thank you. And I just have a quick follow-up question. In terms of the upcoming ECHO-301 study, beyond PD-1 and BRAF in high levels, what other genetic biomarkers are you looking at?","And I also know you're looking tumor mutational burden and is that kind of -- was that implemented retroactively or was it a pretty specified biomarker? Thanks.","Reid Huber","Thanks for your question, this is it Reid. So there are 4 core components to the biomarker program for the ECHO-301 study. Those include PD-L1 status; the expression status of IDO1; tumor mutational burden, as you mentioned; and also RNA sequencing.","I'll remind you that PD-L1 status was, in fact, the stratification factor for patients randomized into the study. So those data are available at the time of patient entry and first dose. The other 3 components of that biomarker program are all data sets that are not required at randomization, but we have activities with Merck ongoing now to generate all of those data.","They were all planned upfront in terms of being core components to the biomarker program. And as you know, we don't discuss any statistical plans around that, so I don't want to get into those details. I think what you should think about when you think about that biomarker program rolling out over the year, is that, obviously, L1 status will be available upfront, and that will be an aspect of the data that we'll consider at the time of primary analyses.","The other 3 components, IDO1 expression, tumor mutational burden and RNA sequencing will read out over the course of the year, probably beginning first in the first half of the year; and for some of those analyses, extending into the second half of the year.","Any decision to present those data, of course, will be dictated first by considerations with our collaborator, Merck, and our principal investigators, but obviously they'll also be dependent on the timing of data availability, the correlative efficacy analyses and the timing of those results and, finally, meeting frequency itself.","Unidentified Analyst","Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Alethia Young","Hey. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Alethia, short name. One probably for Steve and another for Reid. On the ECHO-301, I guess we're all trying to figure out how to think about this PD-1 monotherapy control arm. And so maybe can you comment on some of the similarities, differences in the population, those for KEYNOTE-006, CheckMate 027, and how those patients or that -- those populations compare with ECHO-301?","And my second question for Reid is just talking a little bit more about CAR-T and IDO therapy and what you see there kind of initially with preclinical work? Thanks.","Steven Stein","Hi. This is Steven. So in terms of your first question in ECHO-301 and the PD-1 control arm, in this case pembro, you're correct, we used KEYNOTE-006 primarily as the modeling control arm.","In addition, the regulatory labels reflect the data from KEYNOTE-006 as well as the New England Journal publication related to that. It's felt that PD-1 monotherapy in this setting results in a progression-free survival of around 5.56 months, and that's been pretty consistent in all their data sets, including the ones I just mentioned, and their publications and their label.","There's every expectation that given that the study enrolled 700 patients globally that the demographics will absolutely reflect similarly on what were seen in their registration study KEYNOTE-006, there should be no differences.","I'll also remind you that we did a very close comparison of our ECHO-202 data set at ESMO last year and caused all the demographics and the prognostic factors to make sure they were both similar to KEYNOTE-006 and CheckMate 067, and they were.","If anything, our rate of liver metastases was a little higher in the ECHO-202 population, so there's no expectation in any demographic difference. The only thing that will have changed over the years is post-approval therapy availability, but they won't affect the primary read-out for this half of the year. For your CAR-T question, I'll hand over to Reid.","Reid Huber","Yes, Alethia. So it's an interesting space, to be frank. And we're interested in how various aspects of our I\/O portfolio may be able to help augment CAR-T therapy. IDO1 is probably one of the most interesting ones, and there's certainly data that have been presented at medical meetings and published that reflect the impact that IDO1 activity can have on attenuating autologous cell therapy.","And some of the most elegant work in that respect has been done in preclinical models of diffused large cell lymphoma. As you know, when autologous cell therapy is active and engages in their antigen targets, that leads to expansion of the T cells, a tremendous amount of interferon gamma is reduced and it would make sense to have counter-regulatory mechanisms engaged to try to dampen that response. We and others feel that IDO1 could be one of those more important mechanisms.","So exactly how we go about doing that then is a question around collaboration. And obviously, we're not in a position get to talk about that other than to say that it's an area of interest to us, it's an area of interest to several other CAR-T players.","And I suspect that we'll find a way to work together to bring that sort of a study forward, recognizing, of course, the unique patient safety considerations one has to have in the CAR-T space.","Alethia Young","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.","Cory Kasimov","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have two of them for you. So I guess, first of all, curious what we should be expecting with regard to the amount of detail you may potentially include in the initial top line ECHO-301 press release. Do you plan to just tell us the trial was positive or negative and withhold data for a medical meeting? Or you might you provide actual details or maybe you're just not sure yet?","And then the second question I have is on the Jakafi front. Now that a month or so has passed since Celgene acquired fedratinib, I'm curious if you have any updated thoughts on that asset in their hands in terms of the potential competitive positioning and whether this factors into your long-term Jakafi guidance? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","So Cory, Herv\u00e9 here. So yes, on the press release, I would say it's not clear yet. I think you have to take into account the materiality obviously. You have to take into account the fact that we have a partner with Merck, so it will have to be decided together. And you have to take into account what data will be available at the time of the first analysis.","And as you -- as Reid was describing, there are different options there. I think the goal would certainly be to protect the publication, so that is always a trade-off between what can be said from a study prior to its publication and what needs to be kept for the first scientific publication.","So I think what you have seen in the industry, in general, is that the usual way to do the first press release is to look at the materiality aspect, what's important to communicate, and that's probably the frame we will be using for our own press release in the case of 301.","Now on the fedratinib, we can speak -- maybe we can speak about it, let me say a word and maybe Barry can add something. I think the key question we have to ask ourselves here is what's -- how is this product going to add to the existing Jakafi? And in many ways, from the safety standpoint, we can see that there are differences. And we are also looking at what are the options for patients after they have stopped the treatment with Jakafi.","And as you know, there is a lot of data showing that the type of resistance to the JAK inhibitor is such that in fact, you can retreat with a JAK inhibitor after that, and that's what we are looking at. So, Barry?","Barry Flannelly","Yes, so as far as competitiveness, Cory, we actually don't see it as competitor. We do believe that there is a need, an unmet medical need, if patients for some reason no longer respond or come off of Jakafi. But the profile, as Herv\u00e9 was saying, of fedratinib, as we know it and has been published, doesn't really seem to be that safe and effective drug that you're looking for.","Herv\u00e9 talked about we're developing our combinations with Jakafi in myelofibrosis, including PIM, our JAK1 inhibitor delta, and we think we can improve upon that. We're curious about Celgene's purchase of this company. But nevertheless, we'll see what their filing strategy is, whether it's going to be for patients with platelets less than 100,000.","But there, we're confused because we actually have dose in schedule in our label for patients that have between 50,000 and 100,000 platelets. So I'm not really sure where they can go there. In the second-line setting, if a drug does come there, we think that starting Jakafi earlier for myelofibrosis patients and not saving it for later could be a very good thing for patients in terms of their survival.","Cory Kasimov","All right. Great Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is alive.","Geoff Meacham","Hey, guys. Thanks for the question. Just have a couple. When I look at the R&D expense guidance, is the step-up this year, is it mostly a continuation of your later-stage development? Or is there an assumption of moving one of the main targets like GITR or bromodomain, arginase, et cetera, into the later-stage category? And I always ask about R&D capacity, so this is related.","And then one for Reid. On 301, what, if any, has been the correlation between TMB and the tumor microenvironment? I'm just trying to link the science that Bristol's validated recently with what you guys have talked about in the past on IDO?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","If I -- let me take the R&D guidance. I mean, most of what you see is coming from the advancement of the late-stage portfolio. So epacadostat is part of it, and itacitinib in GVHD, where we are running a Phase III study.","You also have to take into account the baricitinib new indications that are emerging because that's a place where we are co-funding a certain percentage of the cost of this study, so that has an impact on the guidance for this year.","And then for the earlier-stage type of project, as you described it, from GITR or arginase or OX40, in fact, we are not anticipating these projects to be in the very large-scale type of clinical trial yet in 2018. And so it's not what's driving most of the cost.","I mean, the fact that there are more projects in the portfolio is, in fact, obviously, increasing the activity, so it's increasing the cost. But the way the R&D budget is sort of evolving from '17 to '18 is a few projects at a later stage, a full year cost on epacadostat and GVHD, and some baricitinib new indications.","Reid Huber","Geoff, this is Reid. I'll take your tumor mutational burden question. I think we're still in the early days as to understanding exactly how and when tumor mutational burden can predict response to checkpoint blockade or how it would be therefore relevant, let's say, to a doublet like epacadostat plus PD-1. The cut point is likely going to matter. I think it's likely to be histology dependent in some respects.","And I'd point to melanoma, the data that we have in the public domain thus far suggests that, in general, it's a tumor histology with quite of a high tumor mutational burden relative to other tumor types. So the typical cut point you have around 10 mutations per mega base, well that's over half the population in melanoma. In fact, it might be closer to 70%.","We'll be evaluating tumor mutational burden, including the degree of mutations as part of the correlative efficacy analyses. I think there's some interesting questions that we'll try to address as to how TMB may relate to other factors, such as IDO1 expression. The available data suggests that it actually doesn't relate really well to PD-L1 levels.","So we'll be testing that with respect to IDO1 activity. And I think there's an interesting question as to whether or not combinations of these biomarkers may, in fact, be superior to any one biomarker, and those will be things that we'll start to explore in the 301 study.","And importantly, there'll be things that we'll also explore in all of the studies of the ECHO program. So if you take a step back, our ability to ask some of these questions and get some preliminary answers in melanoma will also be true in non-small cell lung cancer, in head and neck cancer, in bladder cancer, renal cancer, et cetera. So I think it's a very exciting time for the space. And certainly, the ECHO program is a very interesting one in that respect.","Geoff Meacham","And then just real quick on the guidance for Jakafi. The long-term guidance is pretty impressive. GVHD, I suspect, there's a big addition. But what are the other drivers in that? Is it just steady addition of patients, lengthening duration of therapy, things like that? Or am I missing something?","Barry Flannelly","Yes, most of that -- this is Barry. Most of that growth really comes from continuing treating patients in MS earlier and PV as we penetrate that market to a greater degree, and patients staying on for longer. GVHD is part of that, ET is part of that. But in fact, most of the growth still comes from MF and PD.","Geoff Meacham","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is comes from Ying Huang from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Ying Huang","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have one maybe for Steve. When you do the primary analysis for PFS, would you also take a look at overall survival in this analysis? And then would you also release that maybe trend if you're seeing anything.","Secondly, investors have always thought that the comparison for PFS will be the Bristol combo, which is OPDIVO plus YERVOY in melanoma, do you think that's the right comp we should look at when you release the PFS data from ECHO-301? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Ying, its Steven. In terms of the primary analysis, obviously progression-free survival will come before overall survival. They are co-primary endpoints in the study. The actual analysis is conducted, as you know, by Data and Safety Monitoring Board. And it is common for them to look at overall survival at the same time, particularly to make sure the trend is in the right fashion, et cetera.","Whether they will release that data to us or not, as Herv\u00e9 said, upfront is uncertain at this point in time. It'll depend on maturity and other things. The actual overall survival analysis and final analysis will obviously come much later, and that's the co-primary endpoint.","In terms of the relevant comparator beyond the comparator in the actual study, the nivo IPI data in melanoma has a progression-free survival of around 11.5 months, but it has to couple that with its tolerability profile with a high rate of Grade 3 for adverse events and a high rate of discontinuations.","So all of those are relevant when you do risk-benefit analysis and comparative assessments. Obviously, it's always good to be in the same territory in terms of efficacy, as you then build in the tolerability profile and make decisions related to therapy. But the regulatory comparison is PD-1 monotherapy. The dominant clinical use in the U.S. and Europe in first-line is PD-1 monotherapy.","Ying Huang","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Eric Schmidt from Cowen and Company. Your line is alive.","Eric Schmidt","Morning and thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a couple of upcoming epacadostat milestone questions for Steven. When are we going to see the next sort of Phase I\/II round of updates on PD-1 plus epacadostat? I think Bristol, for example, waiting for the results on nivo plus epa in non-small cell lung cancer.","And then second, I think you also still have some go\/no-go decisions with your partners and tumor types like HCC, gastric, MSI, colorectal and DLBCL. When can we expect those? Thanks.","Steven Stein","Eric, its Steven. In terms of -- It's really a point of data availability and meeting cadence, as Herv\u00e9 used the term earlier, in terms of matching that. So obviously sit down with the partner, Merck or BMS or AstraZeneca, and decide what meeting to target or when to present.","But I think you can expect over the course of this year at the major medical meetings, Phase I\/II updates from ECHO-202, ECHO-204, for example, in some of the settings you mentioned, because that data will become available and be presented at those meetings.","The second question you say there are still, within those studies, some datasets that were -- or some histologies that were added later, like hepatocellular cancer, like MSI-high colorectal cancer, like diffuse large B-cell. As those become available, again we will look at the data with our partners with our investigators and use historical controls to make go\/no-go decisions.","As to timing of that, it really will be over the course of this year and may continue to next year as well. I'd just remind you, at the present time, we have 9 ongoing Phase III's with epacadostat, so those -- we'll make careful decisions related to those histologies.","Eric Schmidt","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Ian Somaiya","Thank you. I just had two. First on baricitinib. I was hoping you could speak to the time line on [indiscernible] for the -- each of the 2 doses of baricitinib. At least based on our review of the available data, TEE [ph] rates for the 2-milligram dose do fall in line within the -- what seem -- the background rates in RA. But as we look at the 4-milligram data, there's a range and -- range of values we get, some that fall within the background rates, some that fall outside of it. Just hoping you just share your perspective there.","And the second question is on the ECHO-301, specifically the biomarker analysis. If you do observe greater benefit in patients expressing IDO or those with high tumor mutational burden, would you amend the protocol in the other tumor cells? Do you still randomize for those characteristics?","Steven Stein","So Ian, its Steven. Thanks for your questions. Again, just to be clear, Lilly is running the resubmission with our input that say a Class 2 resubmission and in the 6-month review now, for which both us and Lilly expects an adcom at some point. As part of that resubmission and one of the key evidence was the ability to submit a much larger dataset.","So obviously, longer follow-up in the Phase III studies, the use of marketed data particularly from Europe and markets like Germany, and then registry data. And Lilly has been clear that there are no new safety signals seen in any large the same dataset. In terms of the confirm background rate of venous thromboembolism in RA patients, there are many places you can go for that data. It's around 0.3 to 0.8 per 100 patient-years.","The most often quoted number is 0.5 for 100 patient-years. The rate of venous thromboembolism in both the 2- and 4-milligram treatment groups in our studies with baricitinib is around 0.5. So our argument with Lilly has been that this -- could be in keeping with the background rate in rheumatoid arthritis. I think you point to the particular analysis around only looking at the studies during the placebo control period, where events were seen on the 4-milligram arm and not the 2-milligram arm.","And that has to have an exposure adjustment done for it. Because if you don't do that at the end, you do get to a rate that is potentially higher, and there are many caveats to that. And obviously, that will be the substance of what's debated during the resubmission and potentially at the adcom.","In terms of ECHO-301 and the learnings from biomarker analysis that Reid outlined, along -- in terms of PD-L1, IDO1, the tumor mutational burden and RNA sequencing, obviously, we always learn from our studies regardless of the outcome.","If there are particularly -- particular subgroups that are enriched in terms of efficacy endpoints, that is something we would always look to applying into other studies, with a caveat that Reid mentioned around particular -- that histologies could have differences.","We will have time to do that because all those Phase IIIs have just started over the last couple of months. And so that is something we can potentially use should there be a dataset to pursue there.","Ian Somaiya","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carter Gould from UBS. Your line is now live.","Carter Gould","Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. For Herv\u00e9, how should we think about the biomarker data from ECHO-301 potentially impacting your regulatory strategy for melanoma?","And as far as time lines and data disclosures, it sounds like there is a potential scenario where you may not get quantitative details on the PFS results from ECHO-301 until, say, ESMO in October, is that unreasonable? Thank you.","Steven Stein","So it's Steven, I'll take that question that you addressed to Herv\u00e9. So as Reid said when we outlined the biomarker plan, we're not commenting on the regulatory specifics around it or the statistics around doing that. In addition, we don't have the data yet to make that analysis. So I'm going to leave the answer to that as stated.","In terms of PFS data availability, as Herv\u00e9 said in the press release, we'll do what's required for disclosure, balancing the need to do full presentation at the scientific meeting and a full manuscript.","So if you're looking for deep granular data, you'll have to wait for the actual presentation, and hopefully a manuscript that follows or even potentially at the same time. The press release data will be top line level data.","Carter Gould","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Katherine Xu from William Blair & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Katherine Xu","Good morning. I'm just wondering about this particular strategy point. For example, right now, your ambition of course is to put epacadostat as one of the foundational I\/O I\/O combos and the combo choice for PD-1, as well as multiple tumor types, and you're well underway doing that.","And you're kind of going after the sort of anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 kind of combo. This position there is similar efficacy and potentially better safety. I'm just curious about -- looking at the landscape, for example, the newly minted Nektar and BMS deal with the [indiscernible] IL-2, which had shown some interesting data in PD-L1 negatives, non-small cell lung cancer and other histologies, and other upcoming molecules. What are your thoughts there in terms of positioning the IDO1 franchise?","Reid Huber","Hi, Katherine. This is Reid. I'll try to take your question. So obviously, we did see the Nektar announcement and actually know the compound quite well and followed it closely. I think at a high level, it tells us 2 things about the space. One is -- and they're both quite important.","The first one is that PD-1 monotherapy or even PD-1\/CTLA-4 antagonism is not driving sufficient benefit. There is a need in the field to build on those regimens. And even though they've had a very important place in setting the field up where it is right now, there is a lot of chemical benefits still on the table, and I think this collaboration reflects that.","Second is that combination therapy is absolutely going to be the rule, it's not going to be the exception. And I think both of those things are, frankly, reflected on our own portfolio, our own development program around epacadostat and other agents. Mechanistically, the Nektar product is designed to increase the proliferation of immune cells, effector cells in the tumor.","And as you know and as we've even discussed a little bit on this call, that's going to lead to interferon-gamma production, and the tumor will command kind of regulatory mechanisms to try to attenuate that T cell response.","So -- and even in the same -- in the case of an effective I\/O 2 receptor beta activation, you're going to have a PD-L1 and likely IDO1 expression increased as a consequence of that.","So in fact, if the Nektar product could show activity and ultimately be successfully developed and have an important part in the treatment landscape, I don't actually see it conflicting with an epacadostat program or other agents. It actually reinforces the need to have truly maximal kind of regulatory coverage at the level of the T cell.","And I think, in that sense, epacadostat PD-1 antagonism is -- has the potential of being a foundational regimen, irrespective of whether IL-2 and the Nektar product is active or not.","Katherine Xu","With regards to preparing for various scenarios of ECHO-301, apparently we know what's going to happen if 301 is actually successful. And also, there could be intermediate scenario where there's some biomarker-defined population that could lead to a path forward, identifying a very good population that is responsive. I'm just curious, have you guys thought about how to prepare for a scenario where it's just a not-salvageable failure for ECHO-301?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","I mean, obviously, I mean the data, when it's available, will tell us what we have. I think based on all the assumptions we have from different tumor types and across a number of indication, we know that IDO1 inhibition is an important mechanism.","So 301 will tell us, as we've said, what we can observe on the overall population as you described it, it will -- and Reid was speaking about it, it give us information also from the subpopulation or the subgroup standpoint. And when we have a lot of that in our hand, I mean, it will guide us how we go to the next step.","Katherine Xu","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for two more questions. Our next question is coming from Liisa Bayko from JMP Securities. Your line is now live.","Liisa Bayko","Hi, great. I wanted to turn over to a different program. And I was curious about your FIGHT-202 study. Can you maybe provide some rationale as to why this would work in some of the other groups you've identified, the patients, for example, without the FGF mutations or with other alterations? Just curious on the rationale as to why it would work there.","And then maybe just a sense of timing for this study and how fast -- if you get the market given the unmet medical need, what would be -- with positive data here in at least one of these groups, what will be the regulatory strategy? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Liisa, its Steven. Thank you for your question. So firstly, it's a compound that we -- came from our own chemistry group. It's a really good compound. We understand its pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile really well in terms of phosphate elevations. And we've dosed that to the maximum allowable there. And we feel that gives us potentially good competitive advantage versus the other FGFR inhibitors, in general.","In terms of picking cholangiocarcinoma, and at the time we started there was only a real -- one competitor there and we basically have been able to jump past them with really good clinical trial execution.","So we feel in terms of cholangio, we're ahead. The FGFR2 translocation population, which occurs in about 5% to upwards of 15% of cholangio populations across the world, it's felt to be a driver there, an oncogenic driver.","So the ability to inhibit that with a good compound whose PK and PD we understand, would then, hopefully, translate to clinical efficacy in terms of response rates and durability of response. There is two other populations, as you point out, that was studied in the same study, which is other FGFR alterations.","That's done to see if perhaps there is some effect there for one, but also from a regulatory standard to demonstrate the negative control, and that's why it includes non-alterated patients at all. So the likelihood in those latter two populations is potentially some small effect in the alteration population.","And then in the non, very little to none because of the targeted nature of the therapy. As a package then, given the number of patients and our ability to execute, that could form the basis of an approval package in the United States and potentially even in Europe given the unmet need and the way the study is conducted. It has enrolled really well.","As we said, we will get data this year. And then we'll look at its stability to form a regulatory submission package over this year and potentially early next year. But we're very, very pleased with how this program has gone to date.","Liisa Bayko","Okay. thanks. Interesting study design. And then just a last question from me. Where else would you see possible expansion of this molecule onto other tumor types? Thanks.","Steven Stein","Yes. So the FIGHT program in general includes metastatic bladder cancer study that's driven by FGFR3 translocations. And then the third study within that suite of studies is in a rare myeloproliferative neoplasm that's driven by an 8p11 translocation, where it's FGFR1 driven actually.","So all 3 of those we're running sponsored studies. There are a host of other areas where FGFR biology may be important, which we're exploring either in small studies on our own or with investigator collaborations. But it's really around FGFR as a driver.","What I've discussed to date is all monotherapy and approval strategies, but there's obviously then opportunities to move into combinations, particularly in earlier-line settings, for example, in bladder cancer or potentially in cholangio if we wanted to do. But it's all around the FGFR biology.","Liisa Bayko","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, our final question today is coming from Ren Benjamin from Raymond James. Your line is now live.","Ren Benjamin","Hey. Thanks, guys for squeezing me in. This one might be for Barry. Can you talk a little bit about your thoughts regarding the real world trends in terms of duration of therapy, how many patients may be coming off? And just some clarity regarding -- I think Celgene mentioned that 60% of patients are on Jakafi, I think Incyte in the past has talked about 30%. Can you help us come to what that real number might be?","A quick one for Steven regarding -- when was the last time the DSMB met? And how often do you guys get an update as to the events that are occurring, so you feel very confident that this will occur in the first half of 2018?","And just another one for Reid, if you could pick a favorite pipeline product that no one's really paying attention to, that people might in 2019 or 2020, which one would that be? Thanks.","Barry Flannelly","So I'll go first and then hand it off to the rest of the guys. So as far as real world goes, the -- we talk about persistency all the time, we know that persistency for both myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera patients gets better all the time. But the best evidence is really turning to the clinical trials, where in our RESPONSE study, 80% of the patients were still on drug at 2 years; and from our COMFORT trials in myelofibrosis, 50% of patients is running on 3 years. Real world data may be less than that, but we know because of the growing total number of patients on Jakafi at any given time continues to grow nicely, that persistency is growing as we continue to add new patients to that.","What Celgene was talking about, I think, was just saying that of the patients who are eligible to receive Jakafi for myelofibrosis, that maybe 10% to 20% of them came off of drug because of intolerability or non -- or loss of response, and then another percent that weren't able to get the drug because it was -- they had less than 100,000 platelets.","What I said before was in fact that, in fact, we do have dosing and scheduling for patients between 50,000 and 100,000 platelets in our label, and that was a result of an sNDA that we sent to the FDA after our original indications. So that doesn't hold up very well.","Plus we didn't talk about fedratinib, it actually has just as much thrombocytopenia as Jakafi does and maybe perhaps even more Grade 3\/4 thrombocytopenia. So that didn't make very much sense. And I'll turn it over to Steven.","Steven Stein","It's Steven. In terms of the Data and Safety Monitoring Board, we don't comment on either the frequency or timing of meetings. In terms of the event rate, we are absolutely confident in that the PFS analysis will take place in the first half of this year.","Reid Huber","Ren, this is Reid. I have to be really careful about trying to pick favorite children amongst a pretty interesting crop. But I think one of the areas that people aren't paying that much attention to and I think it's very important to us is the early development work that we're doing in combination with rux in myelofibrosis.","There's some very compelling preclinical data and translational data that we've generated along with some of our academic collaborators, including at Moffitt. And I think those data support very well a strategy to try to improve the clinical benefit that MF patients received on ruxolitinib, and that could include things like the allele burden itself.","And so we have a very exciting group of trials know that Steven's team is executing that includes JAK1 combination, PI3-kinase delta combinations, PIM combinations and, potentially soon, also bromodomain inhibitor combinations. And that's a collection of science in a space that we understand very, very well.","And from a regulatory standpoint, we could move on aggressively. And you can appreciate what that can mean both to our longer-term revenue prospects in myelofibrosis. It runs a very stark counterpoint to where fedratinib is and what Celgene is trying to do with a slightly inferior JAK2 inhibitor.","And also, it has its own fixed dose combination potential since we're talking about oral therapies on top of rux. So there's a lot of work to do and it's still all potential and no data, but I'm excited by the prospects there.","Ren Benjamin","Great. Thanks, guys and good luck.","Operator","Thank you.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Pamela Murphy, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Thank you Ms. Murphy, you may begin.","Pamela Murphy","Good morning and welcome to Incyte\u2019s fourth quarter 2011 conference call. With me today are Paul Friedman, Incyte\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Pat Andrews, Executive Vice President, Chief Commercial Officer; Dave Hastings, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Levy, Executive Vice President, Chief Drug Development and Medical Officer. Paul will begin with brief overview of the quarter, Pat will update you on the product launch of Jakafi, and Dave will describe our fourth quarter results and 2012 financial guidance.","Prior to opening up the call for the Q&A, Paul will close with the summary of some of our other programs.","Before beginning, we would like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements including, statements regarding our expectations for the launch and commercialization of Jakafi, as well as our development plans for other indications and our 2012 financial guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2011 and from time-to-time in our SEC documents. Paul","Paul Friedman","Good morning everyone. The approval on the launch of Jakafi for myelofibrosis represents a major accomplishment for Incyte and an important advance for patients who suffer from this debilitating disease. Given the compelling benefits Jakafi provides, the encouraging survival trend that was described at ASH and the fact that this is the first FDA approved treatment for patients with MF, as well as the first commercially available JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor not surprising to me that interest in Jakafi is high and that the launch has been going well.","Since approval, on November 16 and beginning on November 22 through December 31, we were able to recognize $2 million as net sales in 2011 based on $4.9 million of Jakafi that we shipped to our specialty pharmacies. Dave is going to walk you through this with more detail in a moment. ","I would like to take a minute to describe why I believe Jakafi is going to be a successful product. First, there is no existing therapy that does what Jakafi does for these patients. Drug truly works, can make a meaningful difference and how a patient with myelofibrosis feels and gets through daily activities. It\u2019s well tolerated. And the associated side effects that are seen are generally well managed. Second, once physicians have experience with the drug, more often first with their more ill MF patients and they see how effective Jakafi is, I believe they want to use Jakafi in the majority of their intermediate or high-risk MF patients. And we believe this represents about 80% to 90% of all MF patients. ","I can tell you that we have gotten back from the field even in these early days multiple testaments to what I just said about the physicians and patients and the responses that they are getting through the drug. Now these two risk groups, intermediate or high-risk, encompass anyone over the age of 65 or anyone who has or has ever had any of the following: anemia, constitutional symptoms, or elevated white blood cell or blast counts, as well as anyone who has or ever had a platelet count of less than 100,000. So you can see in this group why the overwhelming majority of the total MF population fits in to these two risk categories. ","Now, third reason for my optimism is about Jakafi\u2019s commercial potential is that we have received a broad descriptive label from the FDA with no restriction on baseline platelet count, nor is the label limited to patients with splenomegaly or specific symptoms of MF. And this gives me further confidence that overtime the benefits of Jakafi will be viewed as appropriate for most patients with MF.","Myelofibrosis should be just the beginning. The JAK pathway is involved in the growth and survival of numerous other cancers and our plans, as well as those of our partner in Novartis involve advancing into other myeloproliferative neoplasms, hematologic cancers and solid tumors either in separate studies or collaboratively. In particular, in addition to the ongoing extensions of our Phase II\/III trials in MF, there is a pivotal Phase III response trial in patients with advanced polycythemia and there are also trials in leukemias, lymphomas and in pancreatic cancer. ","Regarding the PV pivotal study response, our proposal to amend the entry criteria and reduce the size of the study was accepted by the FDA under our existing SPA. The trial design now involves 200 patients randomized 1:1, ruxolitinib versus best available therapy, and we continue to expect the study to be completed in 2013 with our goal being to obtain FDA approval of the sNDA in 2014.","I am now going to turn the call over to Pat Andrews and then she will pass the baton to Dave Hastings. Pat is going to describe more specifics about the Jakafi launch and Dave will walk you through our fourth quarter results and 2012 guidance and then I will conclude with a very brief update on some of our earlier stage programs before we move to the Q&A. Pat.","Patricia Andrews","Thanks, Paul. Good morning. This is an exciting time for Incyte. Almost immediately after approval, the sales force began calling on physicians and the first patient, a Medicare patient received Jakafi within a week. With six weeks in the fourth quarter to sell Jakafi remembering that one we concluded at Thanksgiving, one included ASH and one was between Christmas and New Year, the level of sales achieved thus far confirms that the launch is going well.","While it\u2019s still early, based on our market research and feedback from the field it\u2019s very gratifying to see how much awareness there already is about Jakafi. Over 80% of the physicians we\u2019ve surveyed say they are aware of the product. As importantly, over 90% of physicians we surveyed who have not yet prescribed Jakafi say they intend to do so.","To give you a sense of how it is going for the reps, so far the sales team has reached about two-thirds of the 6,500 hematologist, oncologist were focusing on, many of them more than once. Because the interest in Jakafi is high and there is a clear unmet need for an effective therapy for myelofibrosis, the reps have been able to have good discussions with their key physicians and accounts and office access has not been an issue.","Thus far the number of physicians who have written the script is above where we thought it would be and while most have written a script for one patient there is a growing number who have written for two patients and then there are some who have written for quite a few. The highest prescriber a leading expert in myelofibrosis has written more than -- a script for more than 15 patients.","As important as the thought leaders are and they are very important, we expect that about 75% to 80% of Jakafi prescriptions will ultimately come from community hematologists\/oncologists, most of whom have only a handful of MF patients and thus far we are pleased to be seeing a broad base of prescribers emerging versus the concentration from a select group of thought leaders.","As predicted, most of the community hematologist\/oncologist are starting with one patient, therefore we continue to expect uptake to be steady and gradual. Also, as we predicted, most of the initial uses in patients who have large spleens and\/or have a high symptomatic burden but we are also seeing some use in earlier intermediate patients, especially among physicians who are already familiar with Jakafi because they participated in COMFORT-I, the US total study. ","In terms of access and reimbursement, this too is going as expected. IncyteCARES, our patient assistance program is functioning well and hoping to insure all eligible patients have access to Jakafi. If financial assistance is needed, IncyteCARES can help patients directly or connect them to third party foundations where they may qualify for assistance.","In regards to payer coverage, most payers take between 90 and 180 days to make formulary decision, consequently most scripts are currently being processed as exceptions rather than underformulary. The time to fill the first script very significantly depending on the payer and the patient\u2019s financial circumstances.","Now, some patients have received product within just a few days, while for others it has taken longer. The average is two to three weeks for the first script. Subsequent scripts are generally dispensed much faster because coverage in financial assistance have already been determined. ","IncyteCARES is also working closely with the specialty pharmacies to ensure appropriate follow-up with patients and their physicians regarding refills and thus far this too is going well.","So, while we are still early on in the launch we are pleased with our results and believe that Jakafi should become the standard care for intermediate or high-risk MF patient\u2019s overtime. With that I will turn the call over to Dave.","David Hastings","Thanks, Pat and good morning everybody. I will start today by discussing Q4 results and then I will review our 2012 guidance.","Let\u2019s begin with 2011 cash. We ended the year with approximately $278 million in cash and investments. This excludes $19 million in restricted cash held in escrow for payments through October 2012 on our 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes. Our cash use for the year was $188 million not including $25 million received for milestone payments and $16 million received from stock option exercises. This was right within our cash use guidance for $185 to $200 million for 2011.","Now moving to Jakafi. It\u2019s important to note that for a period of time we are using a sell-through method for revenue recognition, which means we defer revenue until the specialty pharmacy ships the product to the patient. We will transition to our normal policy of recognizing revenue when our product is received by the specialty pharmacy and once we have an established track record for product returns. While we do not expect product returns to be material, this is a standard practice for many new products.","Through December 31, we shipped 4.9 million of product to our specialty pharmacies resulting in gross revenue of $2.3 million and gross deferred revenue of $2.6 million. Our gross-to-net adjustment for product revenue recognized was approximately $300,000, resulting in net product revenue of $2 million. And our gross-to-net adjustment for deferred revenue was also approximately $300,000 resulting in net deferred revenue of $2.3 million. ","As discussed at our approval call, our gross-to-net adjustment includes the following: fees to our specialty pharmacies, rebates to governmental payers, our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients, co-pay assistance to eligible privately insured patients, and any product returns. We had no cost of goods sold as our finished goods inventory was previously expense of R&D prior to FDA approval. And in terms of our operating expenses both R&D and SG&A were within our expectations.","Now moving to 2012 guidance. It is too early on the launch to provide guidance on product revenue. We intend to provide sales guidance once we have a longer track record and greater clarity of the underlying trends related to Jakafi sales. This is also too early in the launch to determine the steady state impact of our gross to net adjustments on a go forward basis.","In terms of milestones, while we aren\u2019t providing detailed guidance as to the timing or amounts of potential milestones, I can say that there are important events expected in 2012, including the potential product approval for Novartis in Europe and the potential initiation of Phase III in RA by Lilly. ","We also expect $67 million in revenue from the amortization of the upfront payments received under the Novartis and Lilly collaborative agreements. As we mentioned on our approval call, we expect that our previously expensed validation batches will be utilized as inventory. Therefore cost of goods sold should be immaterial in 2012.","In terms of R&D expense, we expect that to range from $215 to $225 million. This includes non-cash stock compensation expense of approximately $25 to $28 million. Our increase in R&D expense from 2011 includes higher co-development cost for the ongoing development of 28050 for RA, our aggressive effort to expand the use of Jakafi and other indications, a commitment to advance our proprietary pipeline in oncology and inflammation and higher non-cash stock compensation charges.","In terms of SG&A expense, we expect that to range from $82 to $88 million. This includes non-cash stock compensation expense of $13 to $15 million. The increase reflects the impact of having a sales force onboard for the entire year, continued marketing investment in support of Jakafi, and increased non-cash stock compensation charges.","We expect our interest expenses here to be $46 million, including a non-cash charge of $27 million related primarily to the amortization of a discount on the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes. As I mentioned earlier, we have an escrow, the $19 million in cash interest expense related to these notes in 2012.","So, with $278 million in cash and a product launch that\u2019s going as expected, am confident we are in a strong financial position. There are also significant upcoming events from our partners that could lead to potential milestones. And so with that Paul I\u2019ll turn the call back over to you.","Paul Friedman","Okay. And so, before we open the call for Q&A I just want to give you a very brief summary of the other compounds that we are moving forward in our pipeline. 428050, the JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor that we partnered with Lilly, the Phase IIb trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients is nearing completion, it\u2019s quite close to completing. Ideally the three months and six-month data will be presented at ULAR [ph] and ACR respectively. Plans for the Phase III are underway and leaves back that the Phase III program will start later this year. And because we have exercised our co-development option for RA, we are now responsible for funding 30% of the associated future development cost for this indication. As a result of this, our tiered [ph] royalties increase and now range from 20% up to the high 20s.","In addition, Lilly recently began a 240 patient randomized, double-blind, placebo-control, dose-ranging study to explore the efficacy and safety of 28050 in adults with moderate to severe psoriasis. While it\u2019s dependent on the timing of patient enrollment obviously, we expect to see that for the primary end point in the first half of 2013.","Our earlier stage named oncology programs for inhibitors of the enzyme C-MET and IDO are ongoing. Both look very promising and are expected to move into Phase II trials this year. Novartis will take over the C-MET program and develop it. And for the indoleamine dioxgenase inhibitor we planned on beginning a trial in patients with melanoma mid-year followed by a trial in patients with ovarian cancer in the second half of the year. And we do have several other promising programs in oncology and inflammation clinical development and I really look forward to describing them to you possibly later this year.","So with that I would ask the operator to please open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Please proceed with your question. Mr. Roden, your line is live for questions.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","I am sorry, I was on mute. Thanks for taking the question and congrats on a very nice start for Jakafi. I really appreciate all the color on the coverage and the time to acquiring a script, that\u2019s really helpful. But we are at the exact mid-point of the quarter here, is there any color you can provide on a weekly run rates over the past five, six weeks vis-\u00e0-vis the first five weeks or so that you are selling in fourth quarter? And then secondly, Dave or Paul, can you comment on how you feel about your capitalization level at this point? You gave us guidance here pretty much in line with consensus, but also you have potential for several cash milestones coming in this year. So, can you give us a sense on how you feel for the year on capitalization? Thanks.","Paul Friedman","Yes. So on the first Matt, we don\u2019t want to get ahead of ourselves. I don\u2019t think that would be good for us and actually would not be good for you. We are very comfortable and pleased with how things are going right up until today, but we are not going to comment on what has happened since January 1st until the quarter is over and we do the next call. But the launch is going well and we are feeling very good about where we are. We just can\u2019t get anymore quantitative than that at this point. On the second question, I am going to let Dave handle that.","David Hastings","Yes, let\u2019s reiterate what Paul said. We are confident, we are in a very strong financial position. Launch is going as expected. We ended the year with $278 million in cash. As I mentioned, our partners have very exciting events coming up this year which would be for obvious milestones for our company. So I think we are in a very good shape from capitalization prospective.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks a lot and congrats on the launch.","Paul Friedman","Thank you, Matt.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ying Wang of Barclays Capital. Please proceed with your question.","Ying Wang - Barclays Capital","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking my question also. First question is, should we expect the gross to net adjustment around a 12% to 13% for the rest of the year? Then also, do you guys have any idea when Lilly might release the data from the Phase IIb RA trail? Thank you.","Paul Friedman","Yes, on the gross, it is a little too early to project what that is going to look like, as I have mentioned a couple of times now. The components of those are primarily driven by Paramax [ph] and once we have an established trend there, we will be able to give guidance as to what the go for gross in that looks like.","David Hastings","So on the RA study, it is my belief that Lilly will not release data prior to the time that it is, either presented at a meeting or the abstract is published, we are pretty confident, but can\u2019t be sure that will happen at ULAR, which is I think the first week in June of this year. That will be, as we said in the script, the 12-week results with the 24-week results are presented at ACR in the fall.","Paul Friedman","I would say from the two-way data that we generated earlier and the fact that the study is designed almost identically, I am looking forward to some very impressive data we make present it. ","","","Ying Wang - Barclays Capital","","Okay. Thanks. And then if I make another follow up, how long did it take the $2.3 million deferred revenue to clear the channel?","Paul Friedman","Well, we are not going to comment on that directly. What I can say is that based on our discussions with the specialty pharmacies, we expect them all probably about three weeks inventory, two to three weeks of inventory, something in that range.","Ying Wang - Barclays Capital","Great. Congratulations, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Eric Schmidt of Cowen and Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","","I understand that you don\u2019t want to comment on sales or trends post December 31, but I was hoping maybe Pat would discuss how many patients were on the drug roughly at the end of the year and number of physicians who had written the prescription at the end of the year? I think she also commented that there could have been some disruption during Q4 due to the holidays and I am wondering, in fact, you observed such disruption in the weekly sales trends?","Patricia Andrews","Hi Eric. So I will try to give you some color on that. On the number of patients, we are not being precise on how many, but in the first six weeks, you might assume that most of the scripts were for one patient that you can almost back into what that number might have been for the first six weeks. There is some nuances to that so it\u2019s not exactly that, but someone might have written for example, a 20 milligram script but done it in 5 milligram bottles and so that patient actually got four bottles rather than one bottle. Or a physician might have written a script for more than a month, so the patient got more bottles. So you can estimate based on what the net reported revenue was.","As far as prescribers, we have a broad base of prescribers which is or we were looking for and we feel that for the opportunity ultimately is with community hematologists, oncologists, that\u2019s why we are focusing on 6,500 of them rather than a select group of thought leaders who may have a higher volume but collectively they just don\u2019t have most of the patients. And with that, at the end of the year about 85% of the physicians with written -- a prescription had written in at that point for one patient and about 15% had written it for more than one patient.","And as far as disruption, the main, I wouldn\u2019t call it really a disruption but there were holidays within the period from when we got approved on November 16 through year end. And holidays mean that the offices aren\u2019t open, so almost, you would expect that there would be lower volume in a four-day week than in a five-day week.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","Great. And just a quick follow up for Dave, could you just remind us what is public about both the Nevada\u2019s approval milestone and the Lilly started Phase III milestone in terms of their size?","David Hastings ","Yeah. Unfortunately due to the confidentiality arrangements between the parties, we can\u2019t disclose that Eric. But obviously those are important milestones for the program. So they would add a lot of weight, in terms of the way they would value that deal, so they are significant and important to us this year.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen and Company","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Salveen Richter with Collins Stewart. Please proceed with your question.","","","Salveen Richter \u2013 Collins Stewart","Thank you, congratulations on the quarter. Just two questions, so just following up on Matt\u2019s question, is the rate of patient additions in Q1 to date similar to Q4? And I think what we are trying to understand is whether a bowless of patients played a role in your fortune numbers? And then secondly what questions are you getting from the physician community for Jakafi, are they mostly on efficacy or safety or to do more with the disease?","","","Patricia Andrews","Okay. So Salveen, on the bowless question, so I wouldn\u2019t say that there was a bowless -- though there were clearly some physicians, some patients very knowledgeable the drugs eminent approval and waiting to get on it. But I wouldn\u2019t say there was a bowless. We didn\u2019t have some of the features that sometimes companies have that kind of creates an artificial bowless, such as an expanded access program or patients trying to transferring over clinical trials, we didn\u2019t have that. And then as far as the types of questions that we are getting, honestly there is still a lot of listening and there is a certain amount on the disease, but really there is just a lot of listening on the new product. The safety has not been an issue at all. Not really come up. It is more on the spleen reduction and the symptoms and discussions along those lines. The only area that I would say there is definitely -- still an educational need is on whether you should have the D617 (inaudible) or not for this drug and that there is still a fair amount of misconception on that you need to have the limitation for the drug to work, when in fact you don\u2019t need to have limitation for the drug to work. But other than that, it\u2019s just what you would expect with a new product launch in an area that has not received a lot of attention and has a higher, then the internal focus is on efficacy, not a lot of worries about the safety.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Collins Stewart","Okay. Thank you. ","","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo. Please state your question. ","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the first quarter of launch. What\u2019s your feedback then on what physicians want to see before they prescribe Jakafi to their second patient? And I am also curious how comfortable our physicians have been using ruxolitinib in patients with platelets below a 100 in light of the broad label?","","","Patricia Andrews","I think they just want to see how their first patient has come back and what he says about the effect on him and generally we expect that to be pretty positive because within sometimes a couple of days. But definitely within a month for symptoms and for spleen you begin to see results. And so chances are the first time that patient comes back, which should be two to four weeks after the initial script, they should be reporting that they are starting to feel better. And then as far as platelets below a 100,000, so for now we do awareness trackers, post-launch and we do Ask Physicians, a rotating group of physicians about 50, have they seen and met patients within the last two weeks or month depending on the time gap between the survey. And we ask them, did you talk about Jakafi, did you put a patient on the product, what type of patient was it, if you didn\u2019t what stopped you, if you did what was the features that lead you to do so, etc. And from that they do say that they are putting patients on drugs who have the spectrum of platelets above 50,000 certainly a good number below a 100,000 and a good number up of a 100,000. ","","","","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","","That is very helpful. And just a quick follow up, are you seeing anything outside of your expectations with regards to adherence rates at this point?","","","Patricia Andrews","No, I mean, it is in a very short period of time, but no, really it\u2019s going very much as we expected it, it would.","","","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","","Great, thanks. Thanks again.","Paul Friedman","Brian, just to add one other thing to this. Probably it will sound like, when the President gives his state of the union and he has people whom he wants to highlight up in the gallery. So just as we have seen and heard in our clinical trials, patients and physicians appreciate how quickly the drug is working and this is one comment that we got back from one of our mid west, reps, we have got significant number of these, hearing of these across the country, the rep had met with one of our doctor\u2019s nurses, doctor is saying that after only three weeks on treatment, his patient is \u201cdoing extremely well and while her spleen is still detectible, her abdomen is indeed smaller and no longer thought.\u201d Patient had also told the nurse \u201cI am feeling better than I have in a long long time.\u201d The rep concluded it is nice to know the doctor, nurse and most importantly the patient, all things Jakafi is worthwhile. That is the course of events with most of these people. We have had a few people who have come into the study, who have been prescribed the drug, as you might have imagined, were so sick, they didn\u2019t qualify for the clinical studies. And we are not certain how well they will do, because they are very very advance patients, but this is a very typical type story for this drug. Just as an anecdote.","","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","Thanks. ","","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Cory Kasimov of JP Morgan. Please state your question.","Cory Kasimov - JP Morgan","Hey, good morning, thanks for taking the question. First of all I am curious how the real world experience has been with Jakafi\u2019s tolerability relative to what you saw in the clinical trials? And then a second question, I guess for Dave, I want to ask you about your convertible debt and I hesitate to bring it up since it\u2019s not even due until 2015, but we are getting are questions on it quite a bit so, it\u2019s obviously well in the money and at this point as your expectation, you would just let it convert into common stock or you would entertain other strategies to avoid that dilution? Thanks.","Richard Levy","This is Rich. Let me just start the comment because the drug safety organization reports into me and we see the spontaneous report that come in. And while there have been a few spontaneous reports they tend to be the same sort of things that we had in our package insert. There have been nothing unusual or surprising. We hear patients say that they have bruising which we saw in the clinical trial but nothing unusual and that doesn\u2019t surprise me because the safety profile was fairly well established in the past. But we will continue to follow that and see but I don\u2019t think there have been any surprises.","David Hastings","Yes, so Cory on the convertible debt, unfortunately there is no magic bullet to rid ourselves of the dilution. What I would say as you mentioned, it is well in the money. We are always looking at our capital structure holistically and obviously that is part of that capital structure. We are hoping that over time, this becomes a capital allocation story. Our capital is precious to us and there are things you can do with notes, it is not callable. But there are things you could do privately and other techniques with the convertible debt but at this point of time we are really primarily focused on the launch and execution, at this point.","Cory Kasimov - JP Morgan","Alright, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Tom Russo with Robert W. Baird. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird","Good morning and congrats on the good start. Just wanted to circle back to a comment that Dave made earlier about inventory levels that are expected. Can you say what was the wholesaler or that did the channels stock in, in weeks at the end of the year?","Patricia Andrews ","We don\u2019t want to get into that detail at this point of time. But again just reiterating in general we expect these guys to hold somewhere between two to three weeks of inventory.","Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird","Would they be expected to have done there that quickly or would they have started up, I am just trying to get a sense of whether there was a lot more than that in the channel at the end of the year or roughly the expected amount?","David Hastings ","Yeah, I don\u2019t think that their purchasing was out of ordinary at all. And I think it\u2019s consistent with what they have communicated to us in terms of their strategy.","Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird","Okay. And then continue to provide updates on the Phase III PV trial and I was just curious, are you able to give kind of a percent enrolled at this point and maybe the distribution of enrollment geographically that you are getting into that trial?","Richard Levy","Sure. You know it\u2019s always been the case that enrollment has gone better outside of the U.S than in Europe. And the amendment that we have put into place last fall has been in effect at all of the U.S sites that are under essential IRB and now most of the ones that take a little bit longer to go through, they go through local IRBs and scientific review assessments before those things get made. With respect to Nevada\u2019s territories, which is predominantly Europe, but not exclusively Europe, those take longer because they all need to go through the National Authorities as well. There have just been a couple of countries now outside of the U.S that have approved the amendment. ","So the effect of the amendment can be looked at first within the U.S, where we have already enrolled in about two to three months, half of many patients in the U.S as we had enrolled over the first year in the U.S. So it\u2019s clearly making a difference, but in terms of magnitude of effect we expect that to have a much bigger impact in Europe and outside of the U.S, because they have been able to enroll more anyway. And there are certain aspects of the way certain things are defined that are potentially more amendable to enrollment in Europe as well. And so we really expect by the end of second quarter to really have had probably by that point, a good three months of experience in Europe with the new amendment and at that point I should have a very good idea as to when the study will close to enrollments and then we can be precise about our timelines after that.","Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird","Okay. And just a last quick question for Pat. Can you just comment relative to expectations you set a couple of months ago about early distribution across payer type and maybe the percent of patients that have gotten free drug to this point?","","Patricia Andrews","Sure. I think on just the free drug, we had estimated it would be 10% to 15% of all patients and that still seems very realistic. And then payer types, so there -- in some regards the payer whether it\u2019s Medicare or commercial doesn\u2019t matter that much from a sales reporting because we don\u2019t pry discounts to either and rebates to either. So they are kind of equal from our perspective. And we thought that it would be fairly equal as far as distribution between those two, we are probably running slightly higher on the commercial side than I had expected but that also might be at the beginning of the year or some other things with Medicare. And other than that, it is very consistent; the Medicaid remains a very small percent, and actually one that has like a large discount automatically associated with it. So in that regard payer distributions probably more on the commercial side than originally anticipated but that could well work its way out in the next few months.","Thomas Russo - Robert W. Baird","Okay. Thank you very much.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Rachel McMinn of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Thanks. I wanted to follow up on the question about bolus and how sick patients working. Can you give us a sense and I know you were trying to target patients that weren\u2019t critically ill because you wanted to make sure physicians had a good experience, but when we think about the initial trends and if you ended up getting a large proportion of very sick patients early on that could negatively impact duration of drug and kind of expectations of what uptake would be in the back half of the year and then I also wanted to dig in a little bit more into dose titration whether physicians are encountering any difficulties modifying the dosed based also some of the hematologic toxicity. Thanks.","Paul Friedman ","So, let me just start and then I think you have a more elaborate answer. With the point I was making was there have been a few really sick people that was the sole point of what I was saying not that the majority of patients who\u2019ll be put on the drug in the fourth quarter were terminally ill people. There are few as you might expect and I think Pat can give you may be a better breakdown of the types of patients we will put on.","","","Patricia Andrews","Sure. So, while there have clearly been some patients who were sicker and we know that from a variety of way. I think that is still a very small minority. Most patients who started on drugs started at the 15 or 20 mg dose and I would say that as far as dose titration goes most physicians have only put one patient on drug and that patient might generally start on 15 to 20. For physicians who put multiple patients on drugs you can see them using the range of doses as low as 5 as high as nearly 25 even there are very very few with that, at the higher 25 and so I would say that they are adapting based on experience as well as what is in the label as to what the right dose is for the patient and the more experience they have the more adapted that they are which is why you see physicians you put on is looking for patients put on one at a 15 and one at a 10 and one at a 20 or something so you see that richness developing and I feel like that will continue with greater experience with the product.","David Hastings","I think it is also fair to say that we haven\u2019t heard concerns coming back to the reps and things like that saying I don\u2019t know how to titrate my patient, I can\u2019t do it, it is too complicated, none of that. It has just been pack and look and see what size doses are prescribed, but we haven\u2019t heard any issues.","","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great and then just one follow-up on the V6 17F mutation and the lack of understanding from physicians on that. You had mentioned at ASH and sort of one of the biggest misconceptions. How does that impact? Is it just something where docs don\u2019t understand it, but you tell them a couple of times they get it or is it something that you think it is actually limiting initial I guess desire to use the drug because GI have to go and test and I don\u2019t want to do that.","","Patricia Andrews","Well actually most test anyway, so that is not really it. It is just the, there has been so much push towards personalized medicine in the last few years and there has been recent oncology products and others where having a mutation is part of the diagnostic criteria so they have just been over the past few years sort of pushed towards believing that if there is a mutation involved in a disease then the drug treats only patients with the mutations, but that is not the case here, we treat a pathway not a mutation and they will get that as just as you know most of the physicians who are in the community have this broad patients across the spectrum of different diseases and their just not as familiar and as on top of what the situation is with myelofibrosis and what the different causes of the disease are, but they generally heard of the mutation and so that is just one of the things that over time with education and greater exposure and familiarity with the product it will work through. I don\u2019t think in anyway limit ultimate usage of the drug, but it probably adds to the gradual and steady nature of our launch.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thanks very much.","Paul Friedman ","One other point was that I think you made the point while just few patients were extremely sick, most of the initial use has been in patients who indeed have enlarged spleens and\/or a higher symptomatic burden, but in fact we have already seen some use in earlier intermediate patients which I think is encouraging.","","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray. Please state your question.","Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray","Thanks and congratulations on a great start. I had a question for Pat, I know we\u2019re roughly 12 weeks into the launch of Jakafi, but can you give us a sense of what the size of the market, I don\u2019t know if there have been any changes in your expectations for the overall market opportunity? And second question I had was on anemia obviously there is a prevalent concern coming from the Phase III studies, whether that has manifested itself in any way in the commercial experience? Then I had one last question on the guidance.","","Patricia Andrews","","Okay. So, the size of the market we have for a long time been saying 16,000 to 18,500 of which 80% to 90% are intermediate were high risk and that has been that is still is the case from everything that we know, nothing has changed our thoughts or opinions on them and I am sorry there are questions on anemia.","Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray","Anemia, yes.","David Hastings","Paul made an introductory statement on that. I don\u2019t think that the phase III date there was a significant problem with anemia. I think what it said is that there was generally a one gram drop in hemoglobin over the first 8 to 12 weeks which is about 50% improved only a 0.5 gram difference at 24 weeks which is very similar to placebo at that point and also was probably at least as good as what you saw with best available therapy and that is what the other choice really is that was seen in the COMFORT-II trial and these patients require -- for those patients who require transfusions they require fewer transfusions then on the control because they have so much more energy from the drug itself and so it is there, but we never really would actually called it a problem per se and then I\u2019ll turn it over to Pat to have any comment on what she may or may not know about anemia in the market place.","Patricia Andrews","So, we are not getting feedbacks from the rep saying that there is a lot of concern over anemia or thrombocytopenia that in fact the physicians are very used to managing both of those effects and what was really appealing to them is they have not had anything to treat there in that patients with and now if they have something and it is very effective on spleen and symptoms was the heavy symptom burden so they now get to provide something to the patient and we\u2019re not getting the feedback of thrombocytopenia or anemia or issues for them (inaudible).","Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray","If I could ask a little bit differently. Given your clinical trial experience, are you seeing a lower rate of transfusions in the market place with patients all on drug.","Patricia Andrews","It would be really early to see that and to be honest that is not the type of data that we get we\u2019ll have to do separate market research on that and it is probably something I\u2019ll do much later this year.","Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray","Okay and just a question on R&D guidance. What portion of that is related to the 050 [ph] Phase III trials.","Paul Friedman","Yeah. So, we don\u2019t breakdown the actual numbers from the overall number. We\u2019ve never done that, but the bulk of the increase comes from the 30% commitment with the phase IIB and Phase III studies and we expect the Phase III study to start this year so that is a reason that those expenses are going to go up and our aggressive and I think appropriate efforts to expand Jakafi\u2019s indications by having carefully selected a bigger myeloproliferative neoplasm liquid tumors where we know the JAK pathway is turned on and the first solid tumor being pancreatic cancer where the JAK pathway in many patients seems to be overtly active and there is a lot of cytokine-induced cachexia. So, those two areas account for the bulk of our increase in R&D and we think that that is wise spending of money. There are a couple of other smaller items that Dave you might want to answer.","David Hastings","Oh yeah. I just also add that sort of an artifact of the (inaudible) are noncash charges this year our R&D are up over 10 million, so that is another pretty significant component of the increase.","Ian Somaiya - Piper Jaffray","Okay. Thanks and that has been very helpful.","Operator","Our next question is from Thomas Wei of Jefferies & Co. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co","Thanks. I just wanted to understand a little bit more about your Medicare commentary. How has that donut hole affected prescribing so far or did you actually see in the fourth quarter a lot of Medicare patients resisting filling their prescriptions because they didn\u2019t want to pay a double donut hole in both December and January and should we assume that that doctor has corrected itself or does the donut hole concern still persist through the first quarter for this patient population.","Patricia Andrews","So, Thomas as I think we saw both, we saw some patients already through the donut hole, so they definitely wanted to get their medicines in December and if they could get more than one-month supply that was good, but we also saw the opposite. I was very clear that some patients said, \u201cI haven\u2019t gone through yet and I am not ready to pay $1,800 for out of pocket for something that I am going to pay another $1,800 on two weeks later. So, there was clearly some waiting on that. However; once you go through the donut hole you are through it and so if you want to get on drug there is really no reason to wait once the New Year starts and the only reason would be that you don\u2019t have the money and you need assistance and for that there are foundations established that have been very very active since they were set up, but particularly since the beginning of the year and I think that combination up there is no really no need to wait because you have to go through the donut hole and deal with the first prescription of Jakafi and that the foundations are there and they are able to support patients who have financial need, but there is really no reason to wait. I expected that to work its way out within the first quarter.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co","And the other sense of what proportion of Medicare patients in general with myelofibrosis actually exceed their donut hole before the launch of Jakafi just based on whatever diseases they had or whatever drugs they were receiving, was the donut hole something that they typically encountered, you know what percentage maybe encountered at?","Patricia Andrews","No. I wouldn\u2019t have that level of detail.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co","And then just following up on Ian\u2019s question about the size of the patient population. I got some, here you got your field force out there. If we have to guess what is the direction of your bias on the patient population number based on what the sales force is seeing out there in physician practices. Do you think that number to go higher, lower and also seeing with the proportion of low versus intermediate versus high risk?","Patricia Andrews","So, again there has not been enough time for me to change any view that I had on the size of the market or the distribution across different segments. It is just we needed more time and actually substantial amount more time, most of this year I would say before we would be able to have additional insight into those two questions Thomas.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Sapna Srivastava with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Yogesh \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi this is Yogesh on behalf of Sapna. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the launch. I just want to follow-up, is there any further color on in terms of the patient phase breakdown between intermediate I, intermediate II and high risk and then also in terms of the prescriber base between community and academics.","Patricia Andrews","Not really, between community and academic it is probably weighted slightly more towards academics at the moment, but that is because they were more familiar with the product because more of them were COMFORT-I investigators, but I fully expect that to modify and go to the 75 to 80% of all patients we expect to come from the community and we\u2019re not quite there at the moment, but we\u2019re getting it is closing in on that and\u2026","Yogesh \u2013 Goldman Sachs","In terms of intermediate I, intermediate II and high risk patients.","Patricia Andrews","We don\u2019t ask for that breakdown that we don\u2019t get that and I wouldn\u2019t know anecdotally we\u2019re getting more use in the high risk and the intermediate II and it will take longer to work through the intermediate I as I said before there is more obvious patients for the drug and it is those with greater splenomegaly and a greater symptom burden and they are more likely go on the drug first and so it is not surprising that is really where we see more usage and that would take a period of time for physicians and their offices and patients to be fully comfortable going on the drug earlier and earlier in the disease and so that is why this is a launch that takes time and doesn\u2019t all occur in the first 3 to 6 months, but that is where we are heading toward and I expect that the end of this year, next year we\u2019ll see a lot more usage in the earlier stage.","Yogesh \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That is great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Friedman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Patricia Andrews","Actually, could I just add because maybe it wasn\u2019t clear what I said. The majority of all prescribes have to date have been in the community on more of the academics have prescribed more than one patient, but the majority of all prescribes even now have been in the community.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley","Thanks for taking my question. Just on the reimbursement side, are you seeing payers have any specific hurdles either to get on drug or to stay on drug regarding spleen size or counts or symptom burden specifically more on the back end, are there any checks on the back-end to make sure the people are responding in a safe way in order to allow them to maintain the prescriptions.","Patricia Andrews","Again it takes most payers 90 to 180 days before the next formulary decisions and so what we are operating under now and certainly through year-end has been much more on an exception basis and it would be to draw conclusions from that. It is an oncology product and therefore a protected class in Medicare and it is difficult for them to Medicare patient to be restricted beyond what is actually in the label and on the commercial side again we\u2019ll see that over time and it would early to comment on that, but I haven\u2019t seen things that are unexpected.","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Crumpler[ph] with Morningstar. Please proceed with your question.","David Crumpler[ph] - Morningstar","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Can you guys talk a little bit about how your potential competing treatments from Sanofi and others if that is something you guys even think about it all again? Obviously Jakafi have a nice head start, but you think you\u2019ll be able to hold on to the market if new entrants do join?","Patricia Andrews","So, I\u2019ll start, but then let others add. I will say commercially it doesn\u2019t matter someone is two to three years behind us. No one is going to wait to go on drug for something down the road and so we have this nice runway of time to get those physicians and the patient community familiar with Jakafi and its benefit and I feel very confident that once patients go on drug and once physicians have the experience with it that most patients will be well controlled and very happy with their medication and therefore physician would not take them off drug nearly because there is other possibilities that are now on the market so new entrants would be competing primarily for newly diagnosed patients which is about 1\/6 of the overall market and when new competitor they always do they always make some inroads but I wouldn\u2019t expect it would be easy for them to do so because the reality is there is a very high unmet need before Jakafi came into the market, but once it is on the market the unmet need reduces significantly and now let others comment on more clinical effects of it.","Paul Friedman","Yeah. So, the Sanofi [ph] compound is a compound that is actually it is highly selective for JAK2. It doesn\u2019t do much for JAK1. Our experience has been that to treat the symptoms well you need JAK1 inhibitory activity. So for them to get significant JAK1 inhibitory activity, they have to go higher in dose which would then lead to more JAK2 suppression, ergo you would predict more bone marrow suppression. Additionally, the pharmacophore that they have ended up with and a number of our would-be competitors have \u2013 have crossed over to another kinase called FLIP 3 and FLIP 3 inhibition leads to significant amount of GI side effects and the drug has that issue. ","So when you look at the profile of that particular compound it\u2019s difficult for me to see any advantage and it\u2019s most likely going to have disadvantages. The other compound is the YMI compound, and again we have talked about that at infinitum and what you have there is a compound that is impacting JAK1 and JAK2 to a lesser degree at the dose they are using than we are and therefore they are lower on the dose response curve. They have a long way to go. They have some off target toxicity, compounds weaker. If we go lower on our dose response curve we can minimize that initial effect on hemoglobin that Rich referred to earlier. You lose a little bit of efficacy but you can still be effective at a dose like 10 milligrams BID, it\u2019s a pretty good dose. ","So, they probably have a chance of getting there. I don\u2019t see at the end of the day when all the data plays out that there would be any qualitative difference other than the off target side effect profile that they do have.","Richard Levy","I just want to make one comment and that is in the relatively short term where they are doing clinical trials, whether it would be targets in Sanofi are potentially YM if they go to Phase III. We are already seeing for some of our open labeled trials that are still enrolling patients with MF, some decrease in our ability to recruit patients, because they say they will just go on and Jakafi is a commercial product rather than going into a clinical trial. Now compare that to a patient that needs to go \u2013 might consider going into a trial where they have maybe a 50-50 chance of being randomized to placebo or to what was currently -- previously considered best available therapy, both of which we have already shown clearly superior results. So I think that you are not going to see a significant impact on our commercial sales within the short term when they are trying to enroll into their clinical trials.","David Crumpler[ph] - Morningstar","Great. Thanks for the answer guys.","Operator","Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Dr. Friedman for closing comments.","Paul Friedman","Okay. Well, as we have said throughout the call, we are very comfortable and pleased with where we are as of today. It is early days and we would be more expansive in what we report going forward. Probably need another quarter or two to really have a good feeling for the trajectory of the launch. And we are looking forward to Lilly presenting their Phase IIb data, I think that is going to be an interesting presentation and moving the other indications for Jakafi along, in particular the RESPONSE trail. And so, thank you very much for your attention this morning and we look forward to speaking with you again. Good bye.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Pamela Murphy, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Thank you, Ms. Murphy, you may now begin.","Pamela M. Murphy","Good morning and again welcome to Incyte\u2019s fourth quarter and year end conference call. On the call today is Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot who as most of you know joined Incyte last month as President and Chief Executive Officer. Also on the call today are Jim Daly, who leads our Commercial Team; Dave Hastings, our Chief Financial Officer; Rich Levy, who directs Drug Development; and Reid Huber who heads Discovery Biology.","Herv\u00e9 will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and Jim will follow with an update on Jakafi, and Rich will highlight progress made in our lead clinical programs. Dave will then describe our fourth quarter financial results and 2014 financial guidance. After our formal remarks we will open up the call for Q&A.","Before beginning, we would like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations for the commercialization of Jakafi, our development plans for Jakafi and other indications and for other compounds in our pipeline and our 2014 financial guidance. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 and from time to time in our SEC documents. Herv\u00e9?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Pam and thank you all for attending this call. So, first obviously I am very excited of joining the Incyte team and I want to congratulate and thank Paul Friedman for building such a company that it\u2019s in a great position to continue to develop a broad portfolio of products to significantly improve patient outcomes.","Now looking back at 2013, we delivered a very strong and sustained sales growth for Jakafi in myelofibrosis and exceeded the revenue guidance. The big news, obviously, for patients was at ASCO when we updated our survival data and suggested that we can slow progression of disease and prolong life of patient with myelofibrosis.","We also saw data from RECAP our Phase II trial of ruxolitinib in pancreatic cancer and that this data are encouraging for patient not only with pancreatic cancer, but also with other solid tumors. And obviously we developed our pipeline of advanced number of projects and during the year we also restructured and strengthened the balance sheet which gives us the ability to invest and grow our pipeline and continue to discover and develop new drugs.","Now looking forward to the future starting obviously now in 2014. First, we believe we will see continued growth in myelofibrosis, which you can see reflected in our net product guidance for 2014 in the range of $315 million to $335 million.","Now remember myelofibrosis is just the beginning for Jakafi. We look forward for expanding to other indications, first in the PV where we expect to file sNDA in the first half of the year, and are getting our team ready for successful launch. And next, solid tumor, where we are planning two Phase III studies in pancreatic cancer and Phase II trials in breast cancer, colon cancer and non-small cell lung cancer. Our lead JAK1 inhibitor also has the potential in treating solid tumor and we\u2019re testing it first in non-small cell lung cancer.","We are also obviously excited about the potential of our IDO program. Just last week we announced that the deal with Merck to combine our IDOl inhibitor with their anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer, where we would be starting studies during the year. And we intend to establish all the collaboration to show that our IDO1 inhibitor can do in various types of cancer. Another combination we are working on is when where we are combining two of our own compound PI3 kinase delta inhibitor and the JAK1 inhibitor first in B-lymphoid malignancies.","Now that is for the oncology portfolio. Now we also where we have obviously a very growing portfolio, but we are not forgetting the potential revenue streams that we have from our compound in inflammation where our alliance with Lilly could deliver significant value for baricitinib, our second JAK1, JAK2 inhibitor, and we are starting Phase II trials for our second JAK1 inhibitor in rheumatoid arthritis in the first half of the year. And you simply have an opportunity there to have an approach where we will have two different JAK1 inhibitor, one in oncology and one in inflammations just as we did with ruxolitinib and baricitinib.","Now, Jim will provide more details around our commercialization of Jakafi.","Jim Daly","","Thank you Herv\u00e9 and good morning everyone. Our gross strategy for Jakafi to add new patients at a healthy consistent rate while keeping patients on treatment longer yielded continued solid results in the fourth quarter as evidenced by the $72.9 million in net product revenues. I would like to thank our Incyte colleagues for their tireless efforts in educating physicians about optimal use of Jakafi to benefit patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis. ","In terms of quarter-over-quarter growth net sales grew 21% with the following components of growth.","Underlying demand as measured by bottles dispensed to patients grew by 7%. Net price accounted for seven points of growth and inventory accounted for 7 points of growth. We exited the fourth quarter with inventory levels at the high end of our normal range of three to 3.5 weeks. The dollar value increase in inventory between the third and the fourth quarters was approximately $4 million, a portion of which we expect to reduce in the first quarter.","Our full year 2013 net sales of $235.4 million, reflects 73% growth over 2012 net sales of $136 million. Our fourth quarter performance was consistent with our expectations for steady growth and underlying demand which we saw throughout 2013. New patient starts remain consistent with previous quarters and the number of prescribers have continued to increase. Through the fourth quarter, nearly 60% of our target prescribers have prescribed Jakafi at least once and 36% have prescribed for two or more patients. One third of new patients come from new prescribers and two thirds come from previous prescribers, reflecting a gradual shift to existing prescribers relative to prior quarters.","We continue to see increasing use of lower dosage strengths, which is driven by physicians individualizing treatment. In the fourth quarter, 5 milligram and 10 milligram strengths represented nearly 50% of dispensed bottles, up from 43% during the same period last year and slightly up from the third quarter this year. This reflects appropriate patients starting on lower dosage strengths or patients titrating downward as necessary.","Looking at 2014, we continue to believe that the total U.S. population of patients with myelofibrosis is between 16,000 and 18,500. Approximately 80% to 90% of patients diagnosed with MF are intermediate or high-risk and we believe there is significant proportion of patients who may benefit from Jakafi, still remain untreated, which provides an opportunity for future growth.","From a physician perspective, we see an opportunity to increase breadth of prescribing while also increasing depth of prescribing. Our expanded sales force will enable us to reach more physicians with greater frequency in 2014. We continue to experience a favorable reimbursement environment. The vast majority of payers manage Jakafi consistent with the label and physicians are able to successfully manage most prior authorizations that exist.","Financial assistance is provided by our IncyteCARES program or through independent foundations. Through scientific channels emerging data on overall survival are emphasizing the medical imperative to treat patients earlier in the course of the disease. We hope to have certain overall survival data reflected in the product package insert as a result of a labeling update expected in the third quarter.","Our guidance of $315 million to $335 million in net product revenues in 2014 reflects year-over-year growth between 34% and 42%, driven by new patient starts and continued improvement in persistency. Our guidance assumes no meaningful contribution to revenues in 2014 from an FDA approved indication in PV.","Based on our market research, we continue to expect, assuming FDA approval, that PV indication will make a substantial contribution in Jakafi sales in 2015. The addressable patient population for PV is larger than that of MF and the length of treatment of PV is likely to be longer than MF. Based upon claims data there are at least 100,000 PV patients diagnosed and treated in the U.S. 60% of them are currently on HU or previously on HU, but discontinued because of side effects or lack of efficacy.","We estimate that approximately 25,000 of these patients are resistant to or intolerant of HU and suffer from uncontrolled PV while on best available therapies. A primary treatment goal for PV patients to consistently reduce and maintain hematocrit levels below 45% was achieved in the Jakafi Phase II study in almost all patients who were resistant to of intolerant of HU.","Patients also experienced reductions in spleen size and improvements in debilitating symptoms. These uncontrolled PV patients have significant unmet needs and reflect a major commercial opportunity for Jakafi. We are taking all appropriate steps to help insure that we will maximize the opportunity in front of us with PV.","We\u2019ve always said that MPNs are just the beginning. We have a deep pipeline of novel molecules and innovative programs that represent an exceptional opportunity to make a difference for patients,","To discuss this in more detail I\u2019ll now turn it over to Rich.","Richard S. Levy","Okay. Thanks, Jim. Our development efforts with the Jakafi in myeloproliferative neoplasms continue to advance on several fronts. With respect to intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis we submitted an sNDA early in the fourth quarter for inclusion of certain survival data in our label and we expect to have a response from the agency by the third quarter.","Additionally, our Phase III registration study for polycythemia vera, that is being conducted under an SPA will readout soon. We expect to have top line data to announce in March or April and then to submit the sNDA in June for the treatment of PV patients resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. As we said in our third quarter call, the FDA granted Fast Track status for this indication and assuming six months review we would potentially have approval by year-end.","Finally, we expect to submit full results from the symptom improvement study in patients with PV, study called RELIEF for presentation at ASH, which should be around the time of our potential PV launch after which we intend to submit an sNDA labeling update for the symptomatic benefit.","I\u2019ll turn next to development efforts focusing on JAK inhibition in solid tumors. During the last quarterly call we outlined results from RECAP, the Phase II double-blind placebo-controlled study of ruxolitinib plus capecitabine versus capecitabine alone in second line pancreatic cancer. These results showed a hazard ratio for overall survival of","0.47 favoring the ruxolitinib arm in our prospectively defined subgroup of patients harboring evidence of tumor-induced inflammation and therefore potentially more likely to benefit from JAK inhibition.","For competitive reasons we\u2019re not disclosing the details around the subgroup at this time. However, based on these very encouraging results as well as the abundance of data supporting this potentially utility of this subgroup in defining higher risk patient population in many other solid tumor histologies, we believe that JAK inhibition represents a new treatment approach of patients suffering not only from pancreatic cancer, but also possibly many other solid tumors. It\u2019s an important therapeutic opportunity for JAK inhibition as this subgroup can represent 30% to 75% of patients depending on the tumor type and line of therapy.","Published literature describing the biology of tumor-induced inflammation and our own preclinical data suggest that selected JAK1 inhibition maybe similarly effective relative to our dual JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor ruxolitinib when it comes to this approach to treatment. By virtue of the bone marrow sparing properties of selective JAK1 therapy this provides its own spectrum of opportunities, particularly in patients with whom myelosuppressive chemotherapy is warranted and in whom concurrent ruxolitinib therapy may therefore be less well tolerated.","We are beginning this development program with two double-blind placebo-controlled Phase II studies in patients with non-small cell lung cancer. These studies will evaluate 39110 on a background of two different chemotherapeutic regimens and we expect these data as well as emerging data with ruxolitinib to lay the ground work for our future development efforts around JAK1 inhibition in solid tumors.","Based on the results of RECAP, the first priority for ruxolitinib is pancreatic cancer. Last August, the FDA granted orphan status for ruxolitinib for the treatment of pancreatic cancer and in November we obtained an agreement on an SPA for a registration trial in second line setting evaluating ruxolitinib versus placebo on a background of capecitabine.","Importantly, as part of this SPA, the FDA agreed that enrollments in the Phase III study could be limited to the subgroup identified in RECAP. They also agreed that we did not have to pursue companion diagnostic development efforts in order to identify these patients.","While sufficiently robust results from the single SPA-approved trial could potentially support approval in order to minimize regulatory risks we\u2019re planning a second, nearly identical Phase III trial in this population. Both of these trials will be double-blind and placebo-controlled, and are expected to enroll approximately 300 patients each beginning in the first half of this year. The primary endpoints in each trial is overall survival.","We\u2019ve also planned three double-blind placebo-controlled Phase II trials of ruxolitinib in non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and colon cancer, all expected to start in the first half of this year. Each study will focus on the subgroup identified in RECAP and will combine ruxolitinib disparities that exhibit low to moderate myelosuppressive effect. Again, overall survival will be the primary endpoints in each of these studies.","Looking at our development pipeline beyond JAK inhibition, I'll turn to our IDO1 inhibitor, INCB24360. We're excited about the potential for this mechanism to provide a meaningful and complimentary therapeutic approach in immuno-oncology, a field which is grounded in the scientific literature and well supported by our preclinical data, as well as by early clinical data in combination with the approved anti-CTLA4 in ipilimumab in melanoma.","The results of a dose finding portion of the Phase I\/II study have been submitted for presentation at ASCO later this year. Even though that IDO1 inhibitors can provide antitumor fact in clinically relevant preclinical models as monotherapy that it is in combination with checkpoint inhibitors such as anti-CTLA4 and anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 were significant synergies has been achieved. Based on these preclinical data needs it\u2019s in our goal to evaluate INCB24360 in multiple combination regimens across various solid tumors.","Therefore we are pleased to have just announced for our first combination study with this novel and particularly exciting checkpoint inhibitor, Merck\u2019s anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, MK-3475. Under the terms of this agreement, Incyte and Merck will collaborate and co-fund the Phase I\/II study in patients of previously treated metastatic and non-recurrent non-small cell lung cancer as well as other metastatic cancers.","The trial should begin in relevant patients in the first half of this year. The Phase I portion is expected to be an open label dose escalation study to define a recommended regimen of the two combined agents. And the Phase II portion plans to evaluate efficacy and safety of that recommended regimen in a randomized population where all patients receive MK-3475, combining with either 24360 or placebo. Incyte will conduct the study, though the design and analysis of the study will be done in close collaboration with Merck.","We will continue to let the emerging science drive our development program for 24360 and we anticipate expanding our IDO1 program further this year. Focusing on indications and combinations where we believe 24360 is able to achieve important benefits for patients.","Our broaden hematology and oncology portfolio also gives us opportunities to combine our drugs when preclinical data suggest the combination we\u2019ll have additional clinical benefits. The first such target competition being evaluated is with our JAK1 inhibitor, 39110 and our PI3K-delta inhibitor, 40093 two distinct mechanisms that exhibit synergy in preclinical studies in lymphoma.","Last month we initiated a safety and efficacy study of this combination in patients with lymphoid malignancies. Now our Discovery group has new programs that are designed to expand and synergize with our clinical development pipeline and we just prepared to share details around these new oncology programs and their strategic importance to us as they reach clinical development.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dave will explain why we very well positioned to fund our expanding discovery and development programs.","David C. Hastings","Thanks Rich. Good morning everybody. I\u2019ll start today by discussing Q4 results and then review our 2014 guidance. We ended the year with approximately $509 million in cash and investments. The cash balance reflects the completion of our offerings of $750 million of convertible senior notes in the fourth quarter. We use a portion of net proceeds from this offering to repurchase a total of $117 million aggregate principle amount of our outstanding 2015 convertible senior notes for $500 million in cash. This repurchase resulted in a one time charge of $17.9 million recorded in the fourth quarter.","Now importantly because of the difference in the conversion price of our 2015 notes compared to the new notes the resulting net proceeds of the Company of $229 million were minimally diluted, about 1 million shares are fully diluted basis per share.","Now moving to Jakifi we recorded $72.9 million of fourth quarter and $235.4 million of full year 2000 net product revenues. Additionally we recorded $8.4 million in Jakafi product royalties from Novartis for sales outside the United States in the fourth quarter and $28.3 million for the year.","Our growth to net adjustment for product revenue recognized was $6.5 million or about 8.2% for the fourth quarter and $22.1 million for 8.6% for the full year 2013. Our gross and net adjustment includes fees to especially pharmacies, rebates to government payers, our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients, co-pay assistance to eligible privately insured patients and any product returns.","We are still using a portion of our pre-launch inventory and therefore our cost of goods sold for both the fourth quarter and full year 2013 was immaterial as this starting inventory was previously expenses R&D prior to FDA approval. In terms of our operating expenses both R&D and SG&A were within our expectations.","Now moving to 2014 guidance, as Herv\u00e9 mentioned our Jakafi net revenue is expected to be in the range of $315 million to $335 million. In terms of our growth to net adjustment we expected the range from 9% to 10% in 2014.","Now because of our portion of the Medicare donut hole the first quarter growth and adjustment is historically higher than the rest of the year. In terms of 2014 contract revenues we expect $13 million in revenue from the amortization of the upfront payment received under the Lilly collaborative agreement.","For milestones, we expect to receive $60 million under the Novartis collaboration once they receive price and approval for Jakafi in the third major European country. We expect the total cost of good sold as a percentage of net Jakafi sales in 2014 would be about 2%. Our product gross margins in 2014 will still benefit from the use of previously expense inventory.","Now steady state when we are using inventory that has not been previously expense, we expect cost of goods to be in the range of 4% to 6%, which includes our tiered low single-digit royalty payments in Novartis, our net sales of Jakafi in the U.S. We\u2019ll begin to pay those once Novartis receives pricing approval for Jakafi in a third major European country.","Now, I\u2019ll turn to 2014 R&D expense. We expected a range from $350 million to $370 million. This includes non-cash stock compensation expense of approximately $30 million to $35 million. Our increase in R&D expense from 2013 is primarily due to increased development activities related to the expansion of our pipeline, including the advancement of the ruxolitinib in pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors. The advancement of our JAK1 inhibitor in solid tumors, and the development of our IDO1 inhibitor in multiple oncologic indications in combination with checkpoint inhibitors.","In terms of SG&A expense, we expect it to range from $145 million to $155 million, this includes non-cash stock compensation expense of $28 million to $30 million. The increase is primarily due to increased sales and marketing investment in support of Jakafi in MF and our pre-launch activities for PV.","We expect our interest expense this year to be $48 million, including a non-cash charge of $37 million, primarily related to the amortization of a discount on our convertible senior notes. So, we entered 2014 in a strong financial position to fund our expanding pipeline, $509 million in cash as well as multiple and increasing sources of the cash flow that include net product sales, milestones and royalties.","So, with that I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","Thank you, Dave. So, just \u2013 you can see the growing number of products into the pipelines, the growing number of indications that we are pursuing and the strength of the team in managing the growth of the organization. And what I see is that, we have an opportunity here, obviously to improve and stabilize the people who are relying on us to develop new products for them, and also to create and build what could be in the future a very successful high quality, high growth biopharmaceutical company.","So I think that concludes our formal remarks, and operator please open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","","Hi, congratulations on a great quarter. Welcome, Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","A couple of questions, for the SPA, can you maybe talk a little bit or actually for the trial I mean, can you maybe talk a little bit about timing of when we might gain some more visibility on the subset that you\u2019re going to be focusing on, and then in terms of \u2013 just a follow-up on that, when you talk about the competitive position, and not wanting to sort of tip-off competitors, can you maybe talk about, are you \u2013 speaking about just JAK inhibitors or other mechanisms as well, thank you.","Richard S. Levy","","This is Rich. Hi, just in terms of the timing, I think the key for us now is really having the best forum to be able to present the whole story, to be able to not just speak to the data but to be actually able to show slides with data and really put that whole story together. And we really think that that best opportunity will be an analyst investor meeting, probably done in Chicago around the time of ASCO probably, the night or some day around the time when we actually present the data.","And what we are speaking about is what is the subset of patients that are going to be included or versus those not included in our trials for both JAK1 and ruxolitinib in the solid tumors. We\u2019ve said that this is related to tumor induced inflammation and we\u2019ll put that whole story together in a full way.","I think most of the ideas are already out there, it really comes down to describing what is the specific parameter that we\u2019re using. And also with respect to the SPAs, we said the SPAs that we can focus on that group in the Phase III trial, as well as confirmed what we\u2019ve been saying from the beginning that we have no expectation or the need to develop a companion diagnostic, and that\u2019s been confirmed in writing in the SPA.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","","Okay, great. Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then for IDO, strategically are you thinking of this \u2013 your strategy to leave this open that you\u2019d have the IDO inhibitor that could be partnered with multiple compounds or are you thinking more about picking a particular immunotherapy to partner with?","Richard S. Levy","Our IDO should be a preferred partner for a whole range of immunotherapies including PD1s and PDL1s and potentially other targets, emerging target as well. But at the same time, if one \u2013 one collaborative module ends up being a much better combination, we\u2019ll let the data drive the decisions after that.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","And then just a technical question, for PV should we be expecting a milestone this year? And maybe what would trigger that?","Richard S. Levy","Well, so the guidance we\u2019ve given for milestones, we\u2019ve said \u2013 just reflect the approval of pricing for Jakafi in Europe.","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","Okay.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","","Great, good morning. Thanks very much for taking the questions, and congrats to Herv\u00e9 for the new role. On IDO with respect to the Ipi combo trial, can you give us the sense, Rich, which what end points you think would best illustrate the added benefit you get with IDO relative to historical controls? There has been a lot of talk about response rates which does make sense. I just wonder if you think that we should be also focused on PFS and OS.","Richard S. Levy","Sure, so what we\u2019re going to be reporting at ASCO is basically the Phase I component of this Phase I2 trial. And so everyone is receiving 24360 and ipilimumab. So the comparison is to [start up our] [ph] controls. And so when you look at ipilimumab and monotherapy, you know that response rates have traditionally been in the 10% to 15% range. We know that progression free survival with monotherapy, and that indication was in the order of three months or 100 days, something around those lines.","And survival is \u2013 for reasons I\u2019ll get into in a second something that\u2019s much harder to compare. So we do look \u2013 I think the focus will be on response rates and progression free survival. The issue with survival is that you really can\u2019t compare one year to the next. In the case of patients who are coming on to this therapy who have not previously received their PD-1or PD-L1 inhibitor if they progress they will often go on to PD-1 inhibitor and have a prolong survival as a result of that compared to what was available to patients when the initial ipilimumab studies were done. So we really we can report what the survival is but in terms of a fair comparison it\u2019s really limited to response rates and progression free survival","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that\u2019s helpful, and in terms of 110 and Jakafi in these solid tumors, can you just maybe speak to how these two can co-exist? Is it simply a matter of being able to dose patients where there are myelosuppressive chemotherapy backbones, or is there something more there that maybe from the wider therapeutic window with 110 do you think that there might be a way to get greater JAK inhibition therefore maybe a differentiated efficacy advantage there with 110, is that on the table at all?","Richard S. Levy","So I mean that\u2019s always a theoretical possibility, but the doses of ruxolitinib that were used in the RECAP study were in the order of 15 milligram twice a day where we saw in the subgroup a hazard ratio of less than 0.5. So I don\u2019t really know that there is room for improvement over what you can do with that sort of dose range of ruxolitinib. What we get concerned about is when you get into highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy that you wouldn\u2019t even be able to provide those levels of ruxolitinib and therefore the comparable levels of JAK inhibition.","So, it\u2019s conceivable that you could go higher with a JAK1 inhibitor in terms of level of JAK1 inhibition than you did with rux in the RECAP study. But that\u2019s not really the rationale for what we\u2019re doing. Right now we have clinical proof-of-concept with ruxolitinib, we have a lot of models and preclinical data to suggest the JAK1 inhibitors will do the same, but until we actually demonstrate clinical proof-of-concept with the JAK1s we are not giving up on studying ruxolitinib particularly in those indications where we believe the drug should be able to be dosed at comparable levels to where it was in RECAP.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS Securities LLC","That\u2019s great. Thanks very much, Rich for the clarity and congrats on all the progress.","Richard S. Levy","Thanks","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","","Thank you for taking my question and congratulations on all the pipeline advancements. First of all, you guys announced your collaboration with Merck PD-1, MK-3475 last year, I am just wondering if you could provide any color on what you have supplied to Merck in terms of pre-clinical data and does that also include some data you preened from the IDO plus ipilimumab trial. And then secondly when are you going to plan to start Phase II portion of the Yervoy plus your [Ipi] [ph] trials here. And lastly just housekeeping question, when should we expect that AACR this year on IDO inhibitor? Thank you.","","Jim Daly","Let me start, so Merk as well as some of the other companies that we are speaking, you mush have seen both our pre-clinical data and our merging clinical data that is not to say that we can define the basis up on which Merk and potentially other companies have decided to move forward with us. So in terms of the Phase II portion of the combination with Yervoy, I think we are getting probably to the point where we begin to study one more cohort and then probably we\u2019ll be ready or in a position to start the combination regimen following that.","Because of the onset of some of the ipilimumab side effects, usually take two to three months to come to fruition. We study patients for a good eight to nine weeks before we actually evaluate the safety and cohort. The cohorts are currently enrolling now it\u2019s not fully enrolled, so I would say it will be a minimum of another three months probably four before we might be in a position to start a randomized portion. And with respect to AACR, let me turn that over to Reid. What do we think AACR on IDO1 inhibition?","Reid M. Huber","","Yes, I don\u2019t think we are going to have we previously presented some data prior, meaning we\u2019ll have an update on our companion diagnostic efforts that are being conducted with Ventana to put ourselves in a position to have a means to potentially select the patients, it\u2019s not clear if we are going to need that in the clinic or it\u2019s going to enable the clinical development in anyway. But we want to make sure that we are in a position to leverage that.","They will also be I think pending here soon a publication from Tom Gajewski from the University of Chicago that will describe a lot of his effort that have been done in collaboration with us exploring the combinatorial activity of IDO inhibition with checkpoint antagonism that includes with multiple checkpoint inhibitors, that we\u2019ll look for those data as well in the coming year.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov for JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey good morning guys, thanks for taking the questions. I have two more for you on the IDO inhibitor. So if the initial novel combo data weren\u2019t advancement, does your agreement with Merck dictate how you will proceed with later stage trials and then I have one other one.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","The agreement is largely around the single trial and does not go into detail about further development depending upon any particular results. Jim is actually were involved, if he has anything to add to that.","Jim Daly","","I agree with that.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","At this point we really don\u2019t want to get into the agreement in much detail.","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, I understand, well, and then much like Merck, it sounds like your interest in casting a pretty wide net from a collaborative standpoint, so when thinking about different combinations with your IDO inhibitor, how much preclinical evidence do you need that you\u2019re getting an appropriate balance in immune response before pushing ahead into placebo studies.","Richard S. Levy","I mean I would say that there are times when those data can be important just advancing our own understanding and creating the confidence that we need to move forward, and I think a good example of that is the work that we have done with Dr. Gajewski in collaboration to study IDO1 inhibition with checkpoint inhibitors.","I think the more that we understand the basic biology of IDO preclinically even in the setting like that we can gain incremental comfort in exploring IDO1 inhibition with other technologies that maybe distinct from checkpoint inhibition, and that necessarily require preclinical gating studies for those. So I would say that part of this depends on the strength of the preclinical data and its internal consistency as well as our emerging clinical data and the changes in all therapeutic landscape.","So, for example, speaking about technologies like vaccine approaches or immune stimulatory agents or even chemo our targeted therapies our confidence in all of those modalities I think is increasing as the immune oncology space is itself developing and we certainly want to be opportunistic and thoughtful as to how we enter into those spaces.","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JPMorgan Securities LLC","","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your questions.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the progress and welcome to Herv\u00e9. Can you talk about the rationale for conducting two studies in Jakafi and pancreatic cancer, two Phase III given that you have an SPA? Maybe talk about the differences between the studies that beyond just, I guess timing and geography, can those be pooled to augment powering?","Richard S. Levy","","So when you look at an SPA, an SPA is based on one trial. An SPA is specific to our particular trial, but an SPA is looked at within the context of the Phase III development plan. And so, the SPA basically says the design of the first study which we call in Janus 1 is acceptable, which basically means that if the efficacy results are there and there are no safety or benefit risk surprises that could be the basis of approval.","The traditional guidelines are that it requires two studies to get approval for new indication or for a new drug. But if one study, particularly on survival, is robust can be sufficient and that's clearly been acknowledged by FDA, but they did reiterate to us that that study would really need to be robust, and we believe it has an excellent chance of being robust based on the recap data. But it wasn\u2019t a difficult thing for us to do, a second trial, and just diminish our regulatory risk because why would we take more risk than we need to.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","In terms of differences?","Richard S. Levy","Yes, so just second and perhaps there, I didn't forget the second part of your question. So both studies are going to have an overall endpoint of survival. They're going to enroll the same patient operation. The second trial called Janus 2. The main difference is that it will have a few less patients in it. They are both around 300, but it is a little bit less and second that we are adding more patient report outcome measures to that study.","Now those are not going to be an alpha controlled endpoint. So we do not expect to get labeling for symptomatic benefit based on that study, but we are developing and generating a tool that could potentially be used in a subsequent study to demonstrate symptomatic benefit in that study. That measure was not ready for prime time, at the time we submitted the SPA for Janus 1, but it's been finalized to incorporate those tools. That's essentially an exploratory endpoint to that study. It's a minor difference.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Great. That's very helpful. Then one just quick follow-up. I know in talking about exploring Jakafi in other solid tumors beyond, pancreatic, I think you\u2019ve mentioned the idea of possibly exploring beyond the subgroup tested in RECAP. Is that something that you're still considering, are you going to be primarily focused on the subgroup only?","Jim Daly","","So, one of the programs that we're doing and I'll tell you that it's colon cancer with ruxolitinib is a very less line of therapy where there are really very limited options. And that study is being designed so that if the results are quite robust that study in large space to compared to the others might potentially be a basis of a group without having to go back and do a Phase III, and so therefore since \u2013 we have pretty clear data in pancreatic cancer that this basis of restricting enrollment, it\u2019s true in pancreatic cancer, we don\u2019t have that data yet in colon cancer. We expect to find it. So we\u2019re actually doing in that Phase II study is we are enrolling two groups one; to meet the criteria and the group that don\u2019t, but the primary endpoint of the study is still based on the patients that do meet that group.","So, in that sense that study is also based on that influence, so we are enrolling the other patient population there. With our studies in non-small cell and breast cancer, we don\u2019t expect that those Phase II studies have the potential to be the basis of registration. So there we are focusing exclusively and only enrolling patients to meet that criterion.","Once we demonstrate \u2013 assuming that we do demonstrate this is colon cancer and the second solid tumor that this a credited market for us, with therapeutic success I don\u2019t think we will ever need to do that again in any solid tumor.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Canaccord Genuity. Please proceed with your question.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","","Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if you could just give us some color on why chose non-small cell lung cancer for the IDO PD-1 combo trial and what tumors might be up next. And then as well as the JAK1, are you not doing the pancreatic trial anymore, I just curious on that as well.","Richard S. Levy","Okay, so non-small cell is a focus of the Merck study. We are going to enroll some patients with other things but the current intend is that the Phase II portion would be focused on non-small cell that potentially could still change. I think that in general without getting specific discussions between companies this evidence that in non-small cell lung cancer PD-1 inhibition is active, but not as active as it is for example, in melanoma. And so therefore the concept was we want to focus in areas where we already know that PD-1 has some activity, but it\u2019s suboptimal we want to try to add to it.","And it is our hope both with Merck and potentially with some of the other collaborations that we are not really prepared to speak to that we\u2019d look at other tumor types as well. But we really can\u2019t get into that until we move forward.","With respect to not doing a JAK1 inhibitor in pancreatic cancer, we\u2019re still potentially looking at JAK1 in first-line pancreatic cancer where the combination is Abraxane and capecitabine which is a more highly myelosuppressive chemotherapy where there is a better chance of activity would be done with JAK1 and ruxolitinib but we\u2019re just still going through dose finding there not prepared to announce anything yet.","For us, we didn\u2019t think in the end it was a good idea for us to do JAK1 inhibition in second-line pancreatic cancer in combination with something like capecitabine again, since we already have that covered, and doing the study there would not directly lead to a new indication, so we\u2019ve been focusing in non-small cell which will be a larger opportunity should those results be positive.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity, Inc.","Thanks guys.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Welcome.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","","Hey, thanks for taking the questions. Which for the IDO1 inhibitor melanoma study with ipilimumab, can you summarize how many patients have been enrolled so far across the various doses explored. And coming back to Matt\u2019s first question, the speculation amongst investors regarding the response rate for that combination has reached very high-level for now. Are you comfortable with those investor expectations? Thanks.","Jim Daly","","So I don't know what\u2019s the investor expectations are. Can you tell me what they are?","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","","We hear now it's 30%, 40% there or higher.","Jim Daly","","Yes. So I mean, I'm not going to say what the numbers are. All I would say is it\u2019s based on a relatively small ends. So there's a lot of uncertainty as for the precision of whatever that number is. So, it was 30% to 40% based on, let's say, 10%, that's given 30% or 40% based on 100%. So, I think the thing that I would ask people to remember is that the numbers are not big, but they are enough for us to believe that this is clearly different in terms of at least response rates and we haven\u2019t really spoken about the time to progression \u2013 the progression free survival compared to Ipi alone.","I don't remember the exact number of patients that are included here. I do believe in the abstract I do believe that there will probably be more data in the actual ASCO presentation than are actually in the abstract, but I would say that in the abstract it\u2019s something less than 20, I believe.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","Got it. And should we focus on response rate as well as depth of response or is it really response rate overall that\u2019s gotten you excited?","Jim Daly","So, I really don't want to try to get into details around depth of response. We know that's been a big topic of presentation particularly with the PD-1 combination, that data is impressive, but what, our comparison here is really it\u2019s the ipilimumab monotherapy. We are not trying to make any statements about comparison to the combination of Ipi ","PD-1s.","Josh Schimmer \u2013 Piper Jaffray, Inc.","Got it. Thanks so much.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Navdeep Singh with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe a question for Herv\u00e9. I understand that you\u2019ve only been in Incyte for a pretty short time, but can you discuss any opportunities you see to improve the business? Are you expecting to make any immediate changes? And then I have a quick follow-up. Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","Immediate changes, no. No, I must say, I mean \u2013 I\u2019ve been here for a month now and the first comment, first view about this organization is about depths and strengths because these are companies that have an ease discovering new products with very good for productivity. So that's what is basis of success and value creation in oncology and that's what Incyte is doing everyday, and it\u2019s a teams that has a track record of getting things done in very effective way and I think the approval of Jakavi, the entire process of developing a first-in-class, getting it approved by FDA and commercializing it successfully now, with some saying that he is giving the organization a lot of confidence that it can be done again and again.","The second piece is the number of short-term goals that we have. We have a very large portfolio of products in the clinic today and we are planning to continue to discover new products for the next two months and that gives us a very good chance to develop a company that will be one of the leading biotech in the future and that's what I'm really excited about.","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, thanks. And then, a question for Rich. Rich, can you please discuss how your IDO1 inhibitor is essentially differentiated from new links IDO1 inhibitor?","Reid M. Huber","We don\u2019t really know all that much about the new link IDO1 inhibitors except that on a milligram per milligram basis it\u2019s considerably less potent, and that doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into a difference in safety or efficacy, but it has the potential that with more milligrams you may run into some sort of safety things before you can get to the potency. But that truly remains to be seen. I think the main difference is how far ahead we are in development at this point in time. They are not ready to do this sort of collaborations that we\u2019re doing until they generate more data and so it\u2019s probably pretty good molecule, but we are ahead and we are not really in a position to comment on it beyond that.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura. Please proceed with your question.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks just had a couple of questions. There's been decades of research pointing to the role of CRP or the prognostic value of CRP in solid tumor. I was hoping to maybe get your thoughts on that front. And more specifically, is CRP the sort of the end target based on the results in the literature; or is it more of a generalized immune effect? And maybe just to follow up that thought, or finish that thought, maybe you could speak to the role of JAK-STAT and its potential ability to maybe regulate CRP or just more broadly the inflammatory cascade in cancer.","Jim Daly","So let me start and them I\u2019m a going to turn it over to Reid, so we created CRP is a marker of certain elements of tumor induced inflammation, and that\u2019s the topic that we are talking about, in terms of what we said tumor induced inflammation. But we are not saying at this point in time as what is the subgroup I\u2019m going to do that. With respect to whether CRP is actually playing a direct role in the cancer or is a marker of systemic inflammation, we know there is literature, and fairly limited compared to the prognostic literature on CRP, suggesting that might have a direct role in terms of leading to optimization, complement activation and things like that.","But we don\u2019t think that you need to hypothesize that CRP is having a direct effect to explain that they are probably our other cytokines and inflammatory mediators that are important in terms of both the effect on the tumor, growth survival, proliferation as well is on the patient as a whole weak out than it is a single mechanism. And with respect to JAK-STAT activation I think there is some data \u2013 there is more data on some tumor types around JAK-STAT activation than on others, but no we are not saying that that is the marker either and Reid you want to\u2026","Reid M. Huber","Yes, I would just add to that but as we think about tumor induced inflammation, it\u2019s really drives to fundamental processes, so one is a local inflammation and the tumor in its micro environment and that has been demonstrated across our numerous studies to facilitate tumor growth, it can drive resistance to apoptosis and even can define human resistance in some settings, but that\u2019s related but I think distinct from systemic inflammation which is even proposed underlying many of the hallmark features of cancer including the hypercatabolic state and poor performance status things like that, each of these factors have been shown to how a negative impact on survival.","And that probably each related over a time with a progressing malignancy, where local inflammation can reshape and have a dysregulated host response. And so I think how you characterize these is an interesting concept. CRP is a way to characterize inflammation, but there are numerous other ways that you can characterize inflammation too. I think you can look at the published literature and just see how many cytokines, the majority of which interestingly send the signal through JAK1 can reshape both the local and the systemic inflammatory response.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","","As you get ready for the ASCO Conference and the revelations during analyst meetings, should we assume that given the lack of a companion diagnostic that it is a fairly simple test for a physician to administer? And that is something that you will be able to readily apply in the marketplace?","","Jim Daly","Are you asking about CRP is a fairly simple test, I\u2019m not sure I understand your question.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Well, whatever this marker is that you are using, whether it is CRP or let's say a cytokine, a specific cytokine, can you give us a sense of how easy it is to characterize it for the average oncologist? Since you mentioned that there's no need for a companion diagnostic.","Jim Daly","Yes, I mean I would say that the tests are readily available through any lab and well established.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Maybe a last question on the IDO program. Maybe a very simple way of thinking about this, but as you look at the data with the PD-1 CTLA-4 combination, we saw fairly high response rates: over 40% if not close to 50%. And I was just curious how should","we think about the data set for a IDO plus CTLA-4 combo given the targets or similarities in terms of where the hits on the immune calculated. Maybe the question","really is, is IDO more similar to CTLA-4? Or is it more similar to PD-1, PD-L1? And how should we think about potential synergies when you look at different combinations?","Reid M. Huber","So Ian, this is Reid. I think it\u2019s very difficult to theorize that based on pre-clinical data. Certainly the mechanism of CTLA-4 as you well know is quite different than PD-1, PD-L1, and I think that is evidenced not only by differential response rate, but also by differential immuno rate of adverse events, where CTLA-4 tend to have a much more deleterious if you will, inflamm related side effects profile.","To the extent we can tell you these things pre-clinically our data both with pharmacologic inhibition and genetic knock-out of IDO1, all support the potential for synergy with these mechanisms irrespective of what the intervention is. And we\u2019ll ultimately have to rely on the clinical data to point us in the right direction. And I think it\u2019s an important aspect of the program to study IDO1 with PD-1s and PD-L1s given they are merging benefit risk profile in a lot of different histologies. And I think that is why we prioritize that and why we are particularly excited about the Merck collaboration that we just announced.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay, thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a great quarter.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you.","Operator","","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question. Rich, if my friend Josh Schimmer is wrong, and the expectation out there is for 20% to 30% response rates, are you more comfortable with that? I'm just kidding. Question on the Merck collaboration, I know you don't want to get into too much detail, but I think it is important for us to understand just going to how exclusive this is. In other words, if Merck were to go and develop its own IDO inhibitor internally or find another one out there in the marketplace, would there be anything that prevents them from taking this initial data set and swapping out your IDO inhibitor and moving forward with a combination?","Richard S. Levy","So I\u2019m not going to get into details around the contract, but no one is tied. Just as we\u2019re not tied from only working with Merck, they are not tied from working with other molecules. It could potentially include. But in terms of the data from the study there are confidentiality agreements around the data from the study and the use there. But I cannot go into any further detail than that.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Then, Rich, going back to the question about the Phase III studies on ruxo in pancreatic cancer, Brian\u2019s question. I guess you\u2019re doing this a little bit differently, doing two smaller Phase IIIs versus what some of your competitors in the pancreatic cancer space have done, one larger Phase III. Could you speak specifically to whether there\u2019s a rationale or bias on your part for going in that direction?","Richard S. Levy","Well, so we have over 90% power assuming a more conservative hazard ratio than we thought in the Phase III study in the subgroup that we\u2019re going to continue to study. For us to do a 900 or whatever the size of the ABRAXANE study was, I mean that would be powered to demonstrate a trivial change in survival or the hazard ratio and that\u2019s not what we expect.","So we believe that Janus1, the study that is under the SPA is sufficiently powered to give not only a p-value of 0.05, but the lower types of p-values that are needed to potentially support approval based on one study. And in the second study is about the same size in the off chance or a possibility that the results are not as robust as we expect based on phase II, then having two studies demonstrating more modest benefits could be sufficient.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Friedman with Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Brienne Kugler \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Hi, this is Brienne Kugler calling in for Dave. Thanks for taking my question. Just a few questions around timing. Could you provide a little more detail around the enrollment timelines for the pancreatic Phase IIIs? And also, when will we start to see the next solid tumor data points for Jakafi and the JAK1?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Okay. I\u2019m not going to get specific yet, because we really like to see who all the final sites are, how long they take to come up and then how fast they actually enroll compared to the expectations that we have.","So with respect to the times of final data in the Janus1 and Janus2 studies, I mean at this point I don\u2019t want to be anymore predictive than some time in 2016, which it\u2019s a pretty wide spectrum from early 2016 to very late 2016 and of course that\u2019s just my current estimate. So, and those are fully blinded studies. So it should be no expectation that there would be interim data before that timeframe.","In terms of the Phase II studies although one of those Phase II studies has a run in to establish the dose of either ruxolitinib or 39110 in combination with the combinations we\u2019re seeing and we don\u2019t know whether it will have to do one dose level to three dose levels and that makes it hard to predict when we would actually start the randomized portions of the studies. There is one study where we feel that the dose has already been established. We're moving directly into the randomized portion and that would most likely be the first study to start to read out.","Now of course they are as we go into other tumors besides pancreatic cancer we're talking about survival as long as in pancreatic cancer. And so you might enroll the studies quickly, but until you\u2019ve had a requisite number of deaths, the results wouldn\u2019t really readout. So on the Phase IIs, I\u2019m really going to reserve any comments on timing of the data other than one of them unless the survival is actually quite long in both arms, should be ahead of the others.","Brienne Kugler \u2013 Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies LLC","Thanks for sneaking me in. I wanted to ask a couple on IDO and Ipi. Just a reminder of the design of the trial, how many patients are being enrolled per dose cohort? Is it the standard three? Also, if you remember or just a reminder of how Ipi alone stacks up on something like duration of response. And then for the JAK1 program, just the rationale for the initial tumor selection here?","Jim Daly","","Okay. Let me just make notes here. So with respect to the ongoing portion of the Ipi study, we\u2019re more than three patients per cohort, because we know that with Ipi alone you are going to get potentially dose limiting toxicities just from that therapy alone. So if you just did three patients and found one DLT you might get a false sense. So we are doing, I think it's six plus six. So you do six originally and if you have more than a certain number of DLTs you expand to 12. And I'm not going to get into exactly how many patients and how many times you had to increase doses, but that\u2019s just a general design.","In terms of Ipi duration of response, my recollection in melanoma, because it's in the order of about 100 days and that is something that we will compare within the ASCO abstract and at the presentation.","In terms of the JAK1 tumor selection, I mean we use several factors here in terms of tumor selection, both the ruxolitinib and the JAK1 inhibitor. Non-small cell lung cancer is a place where the same subgroup clearly differentiates prognosis and we believe that as a result it will lead to differences in the effective our drug, just as it has in pancreatic cancer. It's obviously a large unmet medical need, and there are combinations there that make sense to us. They were plenty of other options. We just have to make some choices here as to how many different studies are we going to do at once and we think we\u2019re taking moderately aggressive approach towards looking at a number of Phase II plans here both with rux and JAK1 in various tumor types.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","","Is that a signal there that lung cancer might be like the next most likely tumor in which this particular selection criteria would be protected?","Jim Daly","","No. We believe that other than pancreatic cancer where we have actually a clinical result. The potential here goes across a wide variety of tumor types. So it\u2019s in the group of many things that we think to have that sort of benefit. And then in terms of choosing between them the size of the potential market, the unmet need, all those things came into, plays in terms of picking the first place that we would look.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Company, Inc.","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from the line Bret Holley with Guggenheim Securities. Please proceed with your question. Bret Holley, your line is live.","Bret Holley \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","Sorry, can you hear me?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Yes. Yes, we can, Bret.","Bret Holley \u2013 Guggenheim Securities, LLC","Sorry about that. I've got a question for Jim. There's been a lot of questions in the pipeline. Jim, you mentioned that 60% of your target prescribers are currently prescribing and I'm wondering how you can drive that up. I guess the current prescribers for Jakafi are both potential myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera prescribers, and obviously that's important to have the polycythemia vera data.","Jim Daly","Yes, Bret, with respect to MF, I think we\u2019re going to keep advancing the ball day-by-day. The next probably major catalyst for us would be getting some overall survival data reflected in the package insert. There is a cohort of physicians, quite frankly, who are reluctant to use a product unless they see an overall survival benefit and I think if we\u2019re able to get certain OS data reflected in the label that should help us expand breadth of prescribing. With respect to PV, our targeted audience for PV is about 10,000 physicians and I think that is going to dramatically increase our overall prescribing base for Jakafi.","Bret Holley \u2013 Guggenheim","Okay, thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Okay.","Pamela M.

You may begin.","Michael Booth - VP, Investor Relations, Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Jessie. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's First Quarter 2015 Results Conference Call. Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, our CEO will begin with a few words summarizing our recent accomplishments; and Jim Daly, who leads our commercial organization, will then provide a commercial update on Jakafi.

Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. We have had a very productive start to 2015, and I will just briefly summarize some of the highlights.","Firstly, ruxolitinib sales in the U.S. and the rest of the world are going very well, reaching a growth rate above 60% in Q1 on a year-on-year basis. We also received a $25 million milestone payment from Novartis during the quarter related to the European (2:24) Jakafi for PV. And we are very pleased also that the Phase III RESPONSE trial of ruxolitinib in patients with PV was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.","Now turning to baricitinib. During the first quarter, we announced with Lilly the successful outcome of the second consecutive Phase III trial of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis. And for epacadostat, our IDO1 inhibitor, we continue to progress very well with our combination studies in multiple tumor types.","During the first quarter, we finalized our Immuno-Oncology alliance with Agenus, which adds therapeutic antibody capabilities to our proven small molecule discovery expertise. It also expands the landscape of potential Immuno-Oncology targets available to us, and it strengthens our ability to identify and possibly advance novel therapeutic combinations.","Such novel therapeutic combinations were also the subject of our presentations last week at the AACR Conference where we presented 11 abstracts. As well as highlighting the FGFR, BRD and PIM inhibitors from my work discovery research, the substrates also included data on the potential immunotherapeutic activity of our portfolio of JAK and PI3K-delta inhibitors.","Also, we announced an important step in our corporate evolution just a couple of weeks ago with our intention to establish our European headquarter in Geneva, Switzerland. Incyte Europe will become the base from which we will conduct our European clinical development operations, and we are excited to begin to build our company outside of the U.S.","Of course, the primary driver of our financial performance is revenue from Jakafi here in the U.S. And I will now pass to Jim to give some additional details on the strong commercial performance of Jakafi in MF and the launch progress in PV. Jim.","James M. Daly - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. With 2015 marking our fourth full calendar year post-launch, first quarter net product revenues of Jakafi reached $115 million. This represents an annual growth rate of 66% over the first quarter of 2014 and was driven by a steady growth in underlying demand in MF, coupled with a meaningful contribution from our newly launched indication in PV.","On a quarter-over-quarter basis, net sales grew 9% with the following components of change relative to the prior quarter. Underlying demand, as measured by vials dispensed to patients, grew 8%. Net price declined by 3%, reflecting a temporary increase in gross to net discounts, driven largely by seasonal increases in Medicare Part D donut hole rebates, partially offset by a 4.75% list price increase taken in early March.","Inventory had a 4% positive relative impact with weeks on hand increasing from the lower end of the normal rate of 3 to 3.5 weeks at the end of the fourth quarter to the middle of the normal range at the end of the first quarter.","Breadth and depth of prescribing in MF continues to grow in a consistent manner, with continued benefit from the overall survival data and updated safety and dosing information that was incorporated into the product label in the second half of 2014, which we believe is driving new patient starts.","While we will be providing more detailed overview of the PV launch performance, based upon six months of findings on a second quarter call, at this point, we can confirm that the launch is proceeding as planned, and we are pleased with early trends and performance indicators.","We are already seeing some patients who've received samples transition to commercial supply. And based upon early feedback from both physicians and patients, the product appears to be performing well and meeting or exceeding expectations. We believe this foundation of successful early trial should enable us to continue to expand breadth and depth of prescribing over time, and to enable us to positively impact a significant proportion of the estimated 25,000 PV patients who've had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea.","On the reimbursement front, most of the large payers have made coverage decisions and are managing to the PV label. And patients are able to access the product in a timely manner with reasonable out-of-pocket costs.","Looking forward in PV, our primary opportunity and challenge is to reinforce with physicians the medical imperative to improve PV management and to translate the Jakafi prescribing information and Phase III clinical data into appropriate and specific PV patients in their practices who require additional disease control.","We look forward to providing you with additional detail on our progress on the second quarter call. And with that, I'll turn it over to Rich to give us a clinical update.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Jim. 2015 has begun very well for the development group. We've significantly expanded our clinical portfolio and our key projects are moving forward. We've also hired Dr. Steven Stein as our new Chief Medical Officer. Steven came to us from Novartis where he was Senior Vice President Novartis Oncology in the U.S. He's already making key contributions to development of our clinical portfolio.","I'll now walk you through the key pipeline updates beginning with the pivotal programs. During the first quarter, we announced with Lilly that the second pivotal Phase III trial of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis, the RA-BUILD trial, met its primary endpoint. With Lilly, we look forward to presenting these data as well as those from the RA-BEACON study in an upcoming scientific meeting. We also look forward to results from the additional two Phase III studies later in 2015.","We also continue to make good progress in the pivotal program for ruxolitinib in second-line pancreatic cancer. As a reminder, given our previous discussions with the FDA during the SPA process, we believe that if results of JANUS 1 are sufficiently robust, it could support registration. We've therefore prioritized enrollment into JANUS 1 over enrollment into JANUS 2 by allocating the faster recruiting sites to the JANUS 1 trial. Recruitment to JANUS 1 is therefore running ahead of JANUS 2. And while we continue to expect data from JANUS 1 in 2016, results from JANUS 2 are now expected at a later date.","Moving now to epacadostat, our IDO1 inhibitor. Recruitment into all four of the Phase I\/II trials of epacadostat in either anti-PD1 or PD-L1 therapies from Merck, BMS, AstraZeneca or Genentech is progressing well. Once we determine the doses to be used in each combination, we expect enrollment in the expansion cohorts to be rapid. If these trials generate positive proof-of-concept data, we would anticipate moving swiftly into potential registration studies.","Recruitment into the Phase II studies of ruxolitinib in colorectal and breast cancer is as expected and these trials remain on track for data in 2016. Because of competition in lung cancer patients with immuno-oncology therapies, recruitment in the Phase II trial of ruxolitinib in lung cancer is somewhat behind our expectations at this time.","Moving to compounds in our emerging portfolio, we've initiated clinical development of INCB54828, our FGFR inhibitor. And later in the second quarter, we're on track to initiate clinical development of INCB54329, our bromodomain inhibitor, which has already cleared the IND process. We present full characterizations of these two molecules along with the science, strategy and data behind our emerging pipeline for potential cancer therapies at the recent AACR Annual Meeting.","Looking now to ASCO. In our view, the key data from Incyte will be from the trial of our PI3K-delta inhibitor 40093 in combination with our JAK1 selective inhibitor 39110. We will be presenting both 40093 monotherapy and combination data with 39110 in the treatment of Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as safety and summary efficacy data in other B-cell malignancies. We look forward to discussing this data after they have been presented at ASCO.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave to give us the financial highlights of the quarter.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everybody. We recorded $115 million of first quarter net product revenues and $16 million in Jakafi royalties from Novartis for sales outside the United States. We also received $25 million in milestone payments related to the European approval of Jakafi for PV. Our total revenue grew at 77% in the first quarter of 2015 over the first quarter of 2014 and this compares well with the 47% growth in total operating expenses that we reported over the same period. Our cost of product revenues of $3 million for the first quarter includes the payment of royalties to Novartis on Jakafi sales.","For the first quarter of 2015, R&D expense was $118 million and this includes a $20.2 million one-time payment to Agenus related to our Immuno-Oncology alliance. The SG&A expense was $44 million in the first quarter, and we ended the quarter with $585 million of cash and cash equivalents.","During the first quarter of 2015, we moved the ex-U.S. intellectual property rights of our early stage assets to our newly formed subsidiary in Geneva, Switzerland. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, some holders of our 2015 convertible notes converted a total of $46.9 million in aggregate principal amount. This was converted into shares of our common stock, aggregating 5.3 million shares. At April 30, our total common shares outstanding are 179 million.","Operator, that concludes our formal remarks. Please open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thank you for taking the question. I have two of them for you. First of all, Jim, I realize we'll get a more detailed update on PV this summer, but thus far in the launch are you able to comment on what you see as the key gating factor to get a doc to initiate treatment and how you think that might change going forward?","And then the second question I have is probably for Dave, and it's on the longer-term tax rate for the company and how that might be impacted by your new European operations. I'm just curious outer years, how we should be thinking about that? Thanks a lot.","James M. Daly - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Hey, Cory. This is Jim. Cory, I think the key gating factor to getting a physician to prescribe Jakafi for their PV patients is translating the clinical data and the indication statement in the label to a specific patient in their practice.","And I wanted to give a hats off to our sales force because, quite frankly, there's no substitute for an effective sales force in accomplishing that because it requires a discussion with the physician of particular patient characteristics and they're doing an outstanding job.","As you would expect, the patients that we're getting right now tend to be the and patients. These are patients who tend to have elevated counts, and substantial symptom burden, and they tend to be at risk for thrombosis. And the sales force is having that constructive discussion. They're able to identify that patient as an appropriate candidate for Jakafi. The results are positive.","And with that successful experience, they earn the right to go back and ask for additional patients who may not be as obvious, may not be the and patient, but may be the or patient. So I think that process is taking place. I think our sales force is doing an outstanding job. There is no substitute for an effective sales force in achieving that gating event. And as we look at new patients starts on a weekly basis, we're pleased and it's very consistent with our expectations.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Cory, this is Dave. On your second question, we have no long-term guidance at this time on the tax rate. We're still working other strategies, and we'll update you at a later point on that.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Salveen Richter with SunTrust. Please proceed with your question.","Salveen Kaur Richter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. Just with respect to physician education for PV, do you see any difficulties translating the spleen response into patient benefit? I think that was a question in the New England Journal of Medicine.","And then a second question on the JANUS trials, just wondering if there was FDA input as to why JANUS 1 would be sufficient for approval here? Are the PRO feedback just not required here? Thanks.","James M. Daly - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Yes. With respect to splenomegaly, some of the early patients that are going on Jakafi do tend to have enlarged spleens. We see that becoming less important as a trigger to treat over time. So at this point, we're not seeing that as a barrier to identify new patients for Jakafi.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So, Salveen, your second question. So when we first were in discussions with the FDA during the SPA period going back about a year-and-a-half, it was clear that if the results were robust in JANUS1 that would be all that was necessary. JANUS2 was designed in case the results weren't as robust as we expected.","When I say robust, there's no specific definition of what that means, but the expectation is clear that if we were even close to the confidence \u2013 excuse me, to the data that we saw in the RECAP study that would be a robust study. So we just have to wait and see on that.","With respect to the PRO that's in JANUS 2 and not in JANUS1, that's still only an exploratory endpoint in JANUS 2 and would have no impact on approval. That was there to kind of demonstrate that that tool was fit for purpose, as they say in regulatory terminology these days, to potentially be used in additional study at later point to get a labeling claim based on symptoms. So that has no impact on the potential for approval.","Salveen Kaur Richter - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question. Jim, I wanted to ask you about the sustainability of the current run rate for Jakafi. I'm tempted to infer from the components of growth that you broke out in your prepared comments that this trend, in fact, is sustainable, possibly even with upside because of the donut hole here. But also just want to get a sense for the inventory you mentioned has climbed up into the normal range. It sounds like there shouldn't then be a giveback in the second quarter.","And then related, Jim, can you comment on what percentage of the sales in the quarter came from PV and whether or not there's any evidence of a bolus of patients coming on that may impact sequential trends later this year?","James M. Daly - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Okay. Let's knock those off. First, let's start with the last because I remember that most vividly. No bolus of patients with PV. We should not see an inventory giveback in the second quarter.","If you look at the sustainability of the trends, there is a natural seasonality to our business. If you look at the last two years, we had single-digit dispense growth in the first quarter for both 2014 and 2013, followed by robust double digit in the second quarter. Not making any forward projecting statement, but I would bet the trend on that. And we are very confident that we can maintain a robust growth trajectory for Jakafi both in MF and you'll see the compounding effect of our success in PV over time.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","So in the absence of a real bolus, I mean, it sounds like you definitely got patients on drug and PV, but this is something you would see as more of a slow and steady gain as opposed to a step-up and then sideways.","James M. Daly - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","Absolutely. No step-changes with PV. PV is \u2013 you have to go out and earn it every day, patient by patient and we're doing that. And again, based on very early data, we're pleased with the rate of new patients going on for PV. And we're also pleased with the fact that, again, based on very early data that they seem to be staying on Jakafi and PV to a greater extent than what we saw with MF. So we think this is a slow steady build that will compound very nicely over time.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. And then if I may do a quick question for Rich here. You have the IDO and Yervoy combination data. If I'm not mistaken, that's to be presented at ESMO. And we understand that this combo with Yervoy isn't strategically as important to you, but can you give us a sense of what we may expect to learn from those data about IDO itself?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So the number of patients from which we will have data at ESMO is about twice the number that we had data when the data was first presented at ASCO last year. And secondly, the duration of therapy in the patients who have been on therapy for a while is longer. That's all I really feel comfortable saying about the data at this point in time.","And I don't really know how to answer the question as to how you would translate the data in combination with Yervoy to expectations around the data with PD1s or PD-L1s other than to say that we're seeing that this is an active drug in immuno-oncology in combination with Yervoy. And that gives us confidence the same way as it has before, that we will see that it remains active and adds benefit to other immuno-oncology combinations including PD1s and PD-L1s.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks, Rich, and thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Steve Byrne with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So Jim, with respect to the results in MF, looks like maybe you're near 30% penetration or something in that range. Would you say that looking forward that the opportunity is more to drive up that percentage of patients within the haem-oncology community? Or do you think that there's more opportunity by reaching docs that are currently not using rux in their MF patients?","James M. Daly - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","That's a very fair question, and I hate to sound like I'm hedging, but I think the answer is both. I think with the overall survival data inclusion in the label, we saw an increase in both the breadth of prescribing, we saw physicians who had never prescribed the product begin to trial and adopt. And we saw a greater depth to prescribing.","Now, with the second indication in PV, we're actually seeing physicians going back and evaluating some of their watch-and-wait MF patients and some of the later-adopter physicians seeing that as a motivation to initiate their first patient in MF.","Actually, as you look at the prescribing for PV, 25% of prescribers in PV had never prescribed a product before in MF. And with positive experience in PV, we think there may be a halo effect for them to go back and use the product in MF. So I think we're optimistic that we can see an expansion in both breadth and depth in MF going forward.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And is the doc feedback so far in PV suggest support for that prior estimate of 25% of PV patients could be eligible for Jakafi? Do you still feel comfortable with that?","James M. Daly - Chief Commercial Officer & Executive VP","I think we feel more confident in that estimate today than we did last year when we communicated it. The patients are definitely there without a doubt, and it's simply a matter of establishing successful trial and making sure the physician and the patient has a positive experience and then asking for the next patient.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And then just one for either Reid or Rich, and that is based on the data that you presented last week on the mechanism of action of rux, specifically, on effector and suppressor cells, do you see the longer-term opportunity in combinations with other specific therapies, I would say in contrast to the JANUS studies, which are simply an add-on to capecitabine? Where do you see that opportunity longer-term?","Reid M. Huber - Chief Scientific Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. This is Reid, Steve. So I think we've always been interested in exploring the JAK inhibitor franchise we have in combination with both cytotoxic chemotherapies as well as targeted therapies. The biology I think has instructed us pretty well over the years that there is a clear opportunity for JAK-STAT pathway inhibition to augment and improve the effectiveness of both of those agents.","You're asking quite different clinical questions, and you're talking about different patient populations, but I think as you see in the emerging solid tumor development program and I think as you'll see going forward in the development program with new studies starting over the rest of this year, this will continue to be two important themes that will emphasize targeted combinations as well as combinations with cytotoxics.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Yeah. Just to add that, we're studying both. We have clinical data with Jakafi added to capecitabine and emerging data with other agents, both targeted outside of immuno-oncology as well as other cytotoxic agents. And we have a very interesting pre-clinical data suggesting that it will work in combination with immunotherapies, but we need to first start exploring that data in the clinic before we can really make prioritization decisions.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Michael Schmidt with Leerink. Please proceed with your question.","Michael W. Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. I had one regarding your comment on the IDO PD1 inhibitor study, combination studies. You said you may go directly into pivotal studies following the ongoing Phase I\/II trials. And I was just wondering in the context of the evolving PD1 inhibitor landscape and some indications, in particular, in lung cancer, and with some of your partners such as Roche and Bristol now also developing their own IDO inhibitors, I was just wondering if you could talk about your overall strategy with regards to accessing a PD1 inhibitor? Either are you continuing to broadly look at this in an indication basis, irrespective of specific PD1 antibody? Or are you actually evaluating a possible \u2013 pursuing a specific PD1 antibody in the future as opposed to a broader scheme? Thanks.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So we believe we have an IDO1 inhibitor that has no issues with it and that is pretty far ahead of the competitor of IDO inhibitors there are going to follow. And that is the reason why we continue to move forward quickly to maintain our advantage in terms of timelines, which is critical. And our strategy remains to work with a range of drugs, not just across companies with different PD1s and PD-L1s but also potentially to look at other combinations as well, and not to have those decisions be driven by the potential that other IDO inhibitors that are further behind are going to be either licensed to or available to some of the same companies that we've been working with.","Michael W. Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Ian Somaiya with Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks for taking my question and congratulations on a great quarter. My question relates to the Galapagos and AbbVie Phase II results in RA. I was just hoping to get your thoughts on the data we've seen from their compound and how we should think about a selective JAK1 inhibitor versus more of a JAK1\/2 inhibitor and the safety and efficacy profile we should expect for baricitinib?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Sure. So I'm not going to try to get into and dissect the limited details that have been put in the public domain on the Galapagos results in Darwin 1 and Darwin 2. All I would say is that at this point, we don't see any types of strong evidence for differentiation between that product and baricitinib, which is several years ahead. And we look forward to sharing the Phase III baricitinib data with everyone in more detail soon.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","But this doesn't motivate you in any way to maybe evaluate some of your JAK1 inhibitors in the RA setting or autoimmune setting?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So are JAK1 inhibitor, since we've put 39110 into a relatively small three-month study and showed quite interesting results. But we decided that 39110 was going to be an oncology drug. We then took a second JAK1 inhibitor and put it into the clinic for RA and had a tox finding that was not necessarily drug related, but one that made the development more difficult.","So now we'd be talking potentially about another JAK inhibitor that's even further behind. And so you need to look not only at JAK1 versus JAK1\/2, but also the timelines to bring forth another JAK1 inhibitor into this competitive space at this time.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. If I may, just one other question I had. Just some of the increased productivity we're seeing on the R&D side is that a function of new process, new personnel, or just your willingness to invest in your pipeline drugs?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So I mean, I think we've always been highly productive, but the size and scope that we have available to do as many projects as we're doing, just pound for pound, I'm not sure that we're any stronger than we were before, but we've always been strong. We're building and we're building with the same quality of excellent people that we've had in the past to be able to maintain not only how rapidly we progress things, but to put in strong, strategic thinking into what we do so that we're not having to redo our plans on a constant basis. So I'm very pleased with the growth of the development organization. And as I said in my prepared remarks, really happy to have Steven Stein with us to lead the clinical group.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question us coming from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric T. Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just one quick question left for Rich. It's on ruxolitinib and the lung cancer trial. You've been saying that it's been a little bit slow to enroll now for a couple of months. And obviously, the PD1s aren't going away. So do you need to re-jigger the protocol there? Or what are your plans for trying to accelerate and execute in a day and age where there's so many, I guess, ongoing changes in the I-O space.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Right. So it's an ongoing process to evaluate what the next steps should be. And being realistic not only about the competition for enrollment in the studies but the changing landscape over the way lung cancer is likely to be treated by the time these studies read out. So we're continuing to look at that, but we don't have anything specific to say at this point in time.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Herv\u00e9 here. I think it's important to realize that the field we are operating in in cancer for certain indication is moving extremely fast, with big steps happening with some new strategies. So the idea that in general there will be changes in direction depending on how data are emerging from other strategies is something we have to deal with now for the next 10 years.","So in general, what we see in lung cancer where there was a sort of a tradition for 20 years of taxol\/carbo followed by gemcitabine or fluoxetine or something like that is changing completely as we are at the same time developing our own portfolio. And obviously, it's going to change as the standard of care is evolving. And it's not true only for lung cancer. I think there are a number of tumor types where we see the immuno-oncology wave being very successful very rapidly where we will observe the same type of thing.","So I don't think there should be any sort of surprise that there are some of our programs that are going to change directions. It could be the case depending on what we see in our early data there. But in general, it's something we need to get used to for the future.","Jessie, the next question, please?","Operator","Yes. We'll move on to our next question which is coming from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Masha Chapman - JMP Securities LLC","Good morning this Masha for Liisa. Question for Rich. Could you please discuss rationale for evaluating lower dose of JAK1 inhibitor in first-line pancreatic? I guess more specifically, do you have any additional data on what side effects or reasons for patients discontinuing? Is that a function of chemo? And I guess, what are the implications for evaluating 110 in other solid tumors? Thank you.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Okay. So first in terms of the dose. So as I've said previously, we saw a higher-than-expected discontinuation rate in first-line pancreatic cancer patients in the expansion of the existing study and those in months, two, three and four. And we could not find any pattern among them. I don't think there were necessarily any two reasons for discontinuation that were the same. And none of them appeared to me to necessarily be related to the drug and necessarily be related to the dose.","That said, because the discontinuation rate was higher than we expected, we didn't want to go into a large registration study taking the risk that the discontinuation rate early was going to inhibit our ability to see a positive result in the end. And so, we had essentially two choices. One was to just get more patients at the dose that we've already been studying or to study a lower dose. Or potentially, we could have continued to do both. But we wanted to be not so exhaustive in what we did fix that we would be adding too much time to this. So we decided that let's look at a lower dose, a dose that should still provide levels of JAK1 inhibition as high or higher than ruxolitinib provides in the positive RECAP study analysis. And so, we feel comfortable with that lower dose.","With respect to whether this has any impact on our JAK1 in terms of other solid tumor combinations, I don't think that it does. I think that we don't even know that this has anything to do with the JAK1. We don't know this has anything to do with the combination with gemcitabine and abraxane. And we don't even know that this just isn't because the numbers of patients was relatively small and this lead-in to just by chance get a higher discontinuation rate. So we're being prudent, but I wouldn't look at it impacting anything else.","Masha Chapman - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. It appears we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Herv\u00e9 for any additional concluding comments.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Booth, VP of Investor Relations for Incyte. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning, and welcome to Incyte's second quarter 2016 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investor section of incyte.com.","Speaking on today's call will be Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, our CEO, who will begin with a quick strategic overview; Barry Flannelly, who leads our U.S. organization, will provide some detail on Jakafi sales during Q2, as well as reviewing the recent clinical data presented at ASCO and DHA; Steven Stein, Incyte's Chief Medical Officer, will give an update on our clinical portfolio, as well as our upcoming news flow for 2016; and Dave Gryska, our CFO, will summarize our second quarter financial results, as well as the accounting treatment of the recent ARIAD transaction in Europe.

So Incyte is in an excellent position as we enter the second half of the year. So Barry, Steven, and Dave will each provide greater detail on our financial and clinical progress. But first, I would like to spend a minute talking about Incyte from a bigger picture perspective.","We have a plan in place for the growth of our company, and we are executing on that plan quarter by quarter. We are building some important at (2:18) Incyte. And let me summarize our recent progress.","Sales of Jakafi continue to grow rapidly, driven by increased awareness of the benefits of Jakafi in both its MF and PV indication. Our partner, Novartis, has also seen significant growth of Jakafi in ex-U.S. sales, resulting in royalties to Incyte that are up almost 50% over the same period last year.","With more than a decade of expected patent protection for ruxolitinib in front of us, I believe we are in very good shape with this existing franchise.","Our dynamic top-line revenue growth may be further enhanced next year from baricitinib royalties, should it be approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. So first regulatory decision for baricitinib is expected in the first quarter of 2017. And if approved, we believe that it will compete well in the rheumatoid arthritis market, which has been estimated to be worth a total of $21 billion last year.","The ARIAD transaction closed in June as planned. And our European team is now fully operational, supporting and growing the Iclusig brand. Furthermore, the team in Europe is already participating in the development of our clinical portfolio, further validating our decision to accelerate our European expansion.","On the clinical side we have achieved several very important milestone in recent months. Firstly, we initiated the first Phase 3 trial in our development program for epacadostat, so ECHO-301 study is now recruiting patients and is validating epacadostat plus pembro as a first-line treatment for patient with advanced or metastatic melanoma.","So second significant milestone was the achievement of breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA for ruxolitinib in acute GVHD. They are counting (4:10) new approved treatment for this patient population. And we are preparing to initiate the pivotal program for ruxolitinib. I'm confident that our decision to pursue JAK inhibition as a treatment for GVHD has the potential to improve the treatment for \u2013 of this certain deadly disease and provide further growth opportunity for our JAK franchise.","We have also made progress within our earlier stage portfolio. This morning we announced bladder cancer as a first indication for our FGFR program. And in June we added a new clinical program with the initiation of the first trial of our anti-GITR agonist. The large medical drug discovery alliance we signed with Agenus last year has already generated one clinical program. And we anticipate initiating the second clinical program targeting OX40 later this year.","So the first half of 2016 has been a success for Incyte. And whether looking at the company from a top line perspective at our portfolio or at our expanded capabilities, it is clear that we are making significant progress on our journey towards becoming a world-class biopharmaceutical organization.","With that overview, I'd like to turn the call over to Barry for an update on Jakafi.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager US","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. We continue to see strong growth in Jakafi sales. Net product revenue for the second quarter was $208 million, an increase of 46% over the same period last year and a 14% increase over the first quarter of 2016. Year-to-date, net Jakafi revenue has been tracking towards the upper end of our previous guidance.","And given the strength of the clinical data underlying Jakafi and the strong performance year-to-date, we are therefore increasing Jakafi net product revenue guidance for 2016 from the previous range of $815 million to $830 million to a new range of $825 million to $835 million.","The commercial success of Jakafi is built on a foundation of excellent clinical data as exemplified on Slide 8 by the 5-year analysis of overall survival from the COMFORT-I study in myelofibrosis. These were presented at ASCO and EHA in June of this year and support the effectiveness of Jakafi as a long-term treatment for the patients with myelofibrosis. Specifically, the data showed durable reductions in spleen volume and significantly longer overall survival in patients originally randomized to ruxolitinib, compared to those originally randomized to placebo.","The Kaplan-Meier chart on the right of Slide 8 is not adjusted for crossover and still shows a greater than 30% reduction in the risk of death for patients who receive ruxolitinib versus patients who receive placebo. This suggests that these patients may benefit from earlier treatment with Jakafi.","RESPONSE-2 is the second successful Phase III trial for Jakafi as a treatment for patients with uncontrolled polycythemia vera. The data on the right side of Slide 9 were presented at EHA in June and showed that Jakafi was superior to best available therapy in PV patients without enlarged spleens. Patients on Jakafi had better hematocrit control without the use of phlebotomy and experienced more relief from their PD-related symptoms than those on best available therapy.","I'll finish by saying that Q2 sales have given us excellent momentum. And recent clinical data serve to further reinforce the benefit that Jakafi provides to patients with MF and PV.","I'll now pass the call along to Steven for a clinical update.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, Barry. There has been a lot of progress in the clinical portfolio since our last call. And I'll go through the highlights in the next few slides, starting with epacadostat.","Slide 11 summarizes the key trials of epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. In June we were pleased to announce that the first patient was dosed in the ECHO-301 Phase III trial of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab for the first line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma.","Updated data from the Phase I portion of ECHO-202, the combination of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab in a variety of tumor types, has been accepted for presentation at the European Society of Medical Oncology in October of this year. As a reminder, Phase I data from ECHO-202 was first presented at SITC in late 2015. And the ESMO data this year will provide a further analysis of this data set with significantly longer follow up.","Recruitment continues across the ECHO program. And we are on track to meet our year-end recruitment call of over 600 patients into the Phase I and Phase II trials of epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. As we have previously stated, data emerging from these trials will inform our decisions on next steps.","Slide 12 details our current plans for the development of JAK inhibitors for the treatment of graft versus host disease. Receiving breakthrough therapy designation from the FDA recognizes the severe nature of this disease, the clear unmet medical need of these patients, and the potential based on clinical evidence to date for ruxolitinib to address the urgent needs of patients with this life threatening condition.","We are pleased with ongoing regulatory discussions. And we are working towards the initiation of the pivotal program for ruxolitinib in graft versus host disease. The program of trials is expected to focus on the acute and chronic steroid refractory populations.","The first study in the pivotal program is expected to be a single arm trial of ruxolitinib plus corticosteroids for the treatment of steroid refractory acute graft versus host disease.","Additional studies of ruxolitinib, including randomized Phase III trials in both the acute and chronic graft versus host disease settings, are also in preparation.","The proof-of-concept trial of our JAK1 selective inhibitor, 39110, in patients with acute graft versus host disease is now fully enrolled. And we expect to have initial results from this trial before the end of 2016.","Moving now to Slide 13. Today, we declared the first indication with our FGFR program. This will be for the treatment of patients with bladder cancer, harboring FGFR pathway alterations. The unmet need here is substantial. And the trial is expected to be initiated in the next several months.","The data generated within our FGFR program to date is summarized in the upper left of Slide 13 and has provided us with a go forward dose in bladder cancer. We look forward to sharing those data with you at an appropriate medical meeting.","The last program I'd like to highlight is our anti-GITR agonist, 1876. We dosed the first patient in the clinical program in June, and the monotherapy dose escalation trial is currently enrolling in a 3+3 design. This will be followed by dose expansion in several tumor types. The future development of 1876 is expected to focus on combination regimens. And the chart on the right side of Slide 14 illustrate the compound's potential for synergy with PD-1 inhibitors.","Slide 15 summarizes the whole portfolio, which includes 14 compounds in development against 11 different molecular targets. Driven by innovative signs in multiple indications, our portfolio includes numerous opportunities, both as single agents and in combination. As I've outlined, we are making excellent progress on many fronts. And I look forward to sharing our future progress with you.","I'll finish on the news flow slide. And there are multiple potential value drivers for Incyte over the next 12 months. As mentioned, we are preparing to initiate the pivotal program for ruxolitinib in graft versus host disease. And we'll seek to provide you with proof-of-concept data from our JAK1 program in GVHD later this year. We also plan to initiate the 39110 plus osimertinib study in lung cancer. We expect to initiate the 54828 FGFR bladder cancer study later this year. And we'll also provide you with initial clinical data from the FGFR and BRD programs at suitable medical conferences.","In immuno-oncology the updated data from the Phase I portion of ECHO-202, studying epacadostat plus pembrolizumab, has been accepted at ESMO in October of this year. And we'll be initiating a proof of concept study for our anti-OX40 agonist antibody, 1949, in the second half of 2016.","Outside of oncology within the next 12 months, we should be in a position to present data from the ongoing study of topical ruxolitinib in alopecia areata. And very importantly, we're anticipating global regulatory approval decisions for baricitinib for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis early in 2017.","With that I'll pass the call to Dave for the financials.","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone. Q2 was another strong quarter for Incyte. Jakafi continued to deliver strong growth. And we are pleased with the performance of Iclusig in June.","We recorded $246 million of second quarter revenue. This was comprised of $208 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $4 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $26 million in Jakafi royalties from Novartis, and $8 million in contract revenue, including a milestone paid to us by Novartis related to ruxolitinib GVHD collaboration agreement.","Jakafi's net product revenue of $208 million represents 46% growth over the same period last year. Based on Jakafi's performance, we are increasing our full year Jakafi net product revenue guidance to a range of $825 million to $835 million. Our gross to net adjustment for second quarter was approximately 11%. And we expect that the gross net adjustment for the full year to be approximately 12%.","Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $12 million. This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis on U.S. Jakafi net sales, and $2 million for the amortization of acquired product rights relating to Iclusig product acquisition.","Our R&D expense for the quarter was $120 million, including $14 million in non-cash stock compensation. Looking at projected R&D expense for the full year, we are updating our current guidance to a range of $620 million to $630 million. The reduction in projected R&D expense from the previous guidance is in large part due to slower than forecasted head count growth and lower than expected development expense for the JAK clinical programs. In the first half of 2016 we recorded $277 million of R&D expense. And therefore, we expect to see a significant increase in R&D expense in the second half of the year.","Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $67 million, including $8 million in non-cash stock compensation. We are on track to end the full year within our existing guidance range of $285 million to $310 million. We have added a new expense line to our income statement, which relates to the change in the fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability. We recorded $2 million in expense for this line item in the second quarter, which consisted of the month of June.","Turning now to net income and earnings per share for the second quarter. We reported $34 million in net income or $0.18 per share basic and diluted. We now expect 2016 net income to be in the range of $30 million to $40 million, which is an increase from our previous net income guidance.","Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $629 million in cash and cash equivalents. During the second quarter our cash decreased, mainly due to the $140 million payment for the acquisition of the ARIAD business unit, which closed on June 1. We expect positive cash flow from operations the remainder of the year and expect to end the year with over $650 million in cash and cash equivalents.","Now turning to the accounting for the ARIAD acquisition. We have approximately $269 million of intangible assets on the balance sheet related to the product rights for Iclusig. The amortization of these product rights is estimated to be approximately $11 million for the next 6 months and will be included in the cost of product revenues. We'll amortize these product rights through 2028. The goodwill on the balance sheet as of June 30 of approximately $156 million relates to the ARIAD acquisition.","We have also recorded $294 million in contingent consideration, which represents the current fair value of the royalties that we expect to pay on future net sales of Iclusig in Europe. Each quarter we'll record a change in the fair value of the contingent consideration as an operating expense. We expect the change in the fair value of the contingent consideration to be approximately $15 million for next 6 months.","To summarize, Q2 was a very strong quarter. Jakafi delivered strong revenue growth. We successfully closed the acquisition of the ARIAD business unit, adding Iclusig European revenue to our portfolio. And we expect to generate positive cash flow for the remainder of the year, while continuing to make significant advancements in our clinical development programs.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open up the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. Our first question today is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking my questions. I'm just wondering what your updated thoughts may be on presentations from the IDO in PD-L1 and PD-1 combinations and what it takes to make go forward decisions? I do know we will see the mark cohort at ESMO. And just any chance we could see data from the other three cohorts in Q4? Is that more of a 2017 event?","And then just a second question here. With the failure of the Bristol study in first-line lung, how does that impact your thinking on IDO? And any thoughts of adding IDO to I-O\/I-O combinations? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Salveen, it's Steven. Thank you for your question. The ECHO program itself, as I've stated, is progressing very well. We'll enroll over 600 patients this year alone. The 2015 presentations at SITC and SMR on the Phase I ECHO-202 program, obviously we now have a lot of additional scan data. This has reinforced our confidence in the activity of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab in melanoma and our decision to initiate that Phase III program.","As I also said, the whole study will be presented as a poster discussion at ESMO on Monday, October 10, the abstracts for which will go live on September 28. And I'll refer you to that to get that update.","Obviously the entire Phase II program is a lot larger, consisting of ECHO-202, -203 and -204, which is 12 tumor types. We look at at least three aspects, obviously response rate and our time to event data. How long people are on in response in terms of progression free survival. And then the third component is the biomarker data, which is critical. So that will all combine to help us to make more informed decisions in terms of triggering further Phase IIIs.","The first line data that you asked me to comment. And the reason I brought up the biomarker piece at the end is I think it speaks to the importance of using all three components to make decisions, response rate, time to event, and biomarker data.","Obviously the BMS data set used a lower cutoff than Merck had used in their program. And that's something we will look closely going forward at our own data set to help us make informed decisions.","As to when data will be available, we remain \u2013 through the end of this year and early next year, we'll look at these programs and find appropriate medical medians to present to that. And that's all I can tell you about at the moment.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Maybe if I could just ask Salveen's question a little bit differently. I think in the past you had expected to have go\/no-go decisions on epacadostat plus PD-1 inhibitors by year end. If you're kind of not able to hit that milestone \u2013 or maybe you still are. I don't know. But what would you say to the skeptics who say that the inability to make a decision is sort of an indictment of the program? And that you're not seeing much in terms of activity or a clear path forward?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Eric, it's Steven again. And again thank you for your question. Again it's the three components that we need to make decisions, and I'll be repetitive. Response, the time that the end response, progression free survival, and the biomarker piece. We are gathering across the program all three pieces of information. Again enrollment has been as expected or better with more than 600 patients enrolled.","And then there are two components. There's the sit down, we look at, and make decisions. And then when to present it at an appropriate medical median and to find that median. So I don't think it's \u2013 we're still extremely confident in the program and the opportunity. And it doesn't speak to any lack of confidence at all. It's just finding the appropriate venues.","The data is coming in as expected. And again through the end of this year and early next year, we will be able to share that in appropriate venues.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks, Steven.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from the line of Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Good morning, guys. Thanks for the question. Not to beat a dead horse here on epacadostat, but when you look at data in other combo studies, is there a specific number of cycles that you're looking for to be the trigger for next steps? Or I guess scientifically what's the thought on the onset of action from what you've seen so far when you combine epacadostat with PD-1? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Geoff, it's Steven again, and Reid may make additive comments on your second part of your question on the scientific aspects.","I think you allude to \u2013 one thing we did learn last year around the SITC\/SMR experience is to have a little more mature data sets beyond first scan information. Generalizing across a program, we generally do first scans at around 9 weeks and second scans at 18 weeks. And then there on.","And it is around the time to event piece that's most critical here, because that tends to be the endpoint that you use in regulatory studies, including in our own ECHO-301 program, where we're looking at progression free survival as well as overall survival.","So I personally favor having more mature data sets to make informed decisions. And then combining that, as you've seen critically now with the recent BMS experience, with the biomarker piece as well.","So a long answer to your question. But the two scan at least piece of information is critical. And then beyond that in terms of hitting various benchmarks. I don't know if Reid wants to make anything additive to the scientific aspect of having longer data in the immuno-oncology setting, where you actually tend to focus beyond response on things like progression free survival and overall survival.","Reid M. Huber, PhD - Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. Just one other additive comment, Geoff. This is Reid. I think that we know now in immunotherapy that \u2013 and we've come to expect that responses can occur later into treatment. So responses that are converted from patients with stable disease after a number of cycles is not uncommon.","And so it's important to gather that duration of treatment data, so we can more accurately measure and quantify the benefit of a doublet regimen. So absolutely it's an important part of the program. And as Steven alluded to, it's captured in that second bucket of data, where you're looking at durability of response, where you can also convert and capture those patients that are exhibiting responses a little bit later into treatment.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Got you. Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Schmidt from Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my questions. I had one for Barry. In terms of Jakafi growth, could you just break down volume versus price versus inventory movement?","And then I had one for Steven around epacadostat. Is it fair to assume \u2013 that in the Phase II program, is it fair to assume that it's biased towards indications where PD-1 is approved? And how important is it for you to make a Phase III go decision, depending on whether a partner is opting in to cost share the trial? Thanks.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager US","Hi, Michael. It's Barry. Sure. So as you know we had a 14% growth quarter over quarter, Q2 over Q1. And we took a 6% price increase at the beginning of the second quarter. We don't get all of that 6% of course, because of mandatory government rebates and discounts and so forth. So that's about 5%. We know that the gross to net improved in the second quarter by 2.9% versus the first quarter of 2016. And we had a prescription demand increase by more than 6% in the second quarter versus the first quarter.","And I'll turn it over to Steven for the next part of that question.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, Michael. It's Steven. I don't know if bias is the right word. But if you look across the ECHO program in its totality and the four different studies, we have 12 different tumor types there. You're correct in that many of them are considered the hotter tumors that already have approvals for PD-1 or PD-L1. So melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, and just recently head and neck.","But we additionally study in other areas where we will explore the biology of areas where it is maybe not so hot from an immune aspect, like triple-negative breast cancer, ovarian, lymphoma, colorectal cancer, et cetera. And then we'll study all those end points that I alluded to earlier in terms of making decisions. But we're looking at both the hot and cold tumors. So I don't think it's biased.","In terms of selecting partners for future collaborations and how to do them and whether opt-ins, or the importance thereof, I'm going to ask Herv\u00e9 to address that.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Fundamentally, I mean we like to work together with a partner and to have the cost sharing program. So that's something that we are trying to get. But it would never stop us from moving into the next step of the program, if for some reason, the partner was not willing to go and do the cost sharing. So it's basically a good guy if we have it. And if we don't, we go ahead and we do it anyway, if we believe there is enough data to justify moving to the next step.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brian Abrahams from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. Two questions. First off, I guess shifting gears to GVHD. Sounds like the pivotal program, steroid refractory patients, is kicking off. You mentioned we'll get some data for 110 [39110] later this year. Just wondering, where might 110 potentially fit in? Do you see a potential role for that in sort of a different segment? Perhaps in prophylactic or frontline patients? Any reason why a selective JAK1 might work differently versus ruxolitinib? Or is that just \u2013 should we just see that as proof of principle for ruxo?","And then for Barry, I'm wondering as we're seeing continued survival data rollout for Jakafi, are you guys seeing an evolution in clinical practices in terms of earlier intervention in MF? And how much potential room for growth do you foresee in terms of moving towards earlier stage patients?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","So, Brian, I'll start off. It's Steven, and Reid may make additive comments. So you're right. In terms of graft versus host disease, you have to be somewhat careful in separating out the different entities. There's the acute setting and then the chronic setting. And then within the acute setting there is steroid refractory first line and the prophylactic setting. And we feel that both compounds may potentially have a role there.","In terms of the biology that may underlie that, I mean we're obviously developing the clinical data now and look forward to sharing the 39110 proof of concept data with you hopefully later this year. But that's leveraging the JAK1 versus 2 [JAK2] selectivity in terms of myelosuppression in certain settings. And we feel that 39110's best roles in that disease setting may be in first line, so prior to developing steroid refractoriness, and in the prophylactic setting, where the potential in terms of the lack of myelosuppression may be more helpful.","These patients are just post transplants and tend to have lower blood count. So that's one area we may be able to leverage a different biology. And Reid may want to make additive comments there. So both prophylactic and first line.","Whereas for rux itself, our current program is focusing on steroid refractory acute and then the chronic setting, which by definition is also steroid refractory. And I'll leave it to Reid, if he wants to make any more comments around the biology.","Reid M. Huber, PhD - Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. So, Brian, thanks for the question. The data and the translational work around how JAK inhibition is having these productive effects in patients with graft versus host disease is still very much evolving. But to the extent that we've studied it and other academics have studied that, they appear to be mediated largely by JAK1 containing signaling networks. And so it's a very provocative scientific hypothesis, the study of JAK1 selective inhibitor in these diseases.","As Steven said, ultimately the clinical data will tell us what the profile benefits may be of a JAK1 inhibitor versus a JAK1\/JAK2. But there's certainly some emerging scientific basis to be interested in studying JAK1 inhibition in this disease.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager US","So, Brian, it's Barry, just to address your survival data in MF. Yes, strangely, many of our prescribers are only now realizing the survival \u2013 or the benefit of starting Jakafi earlier in myelofibrosis patients.","Now we have two Phase III trials, COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II, with 5-year follow up. And we have a more than 30% reduction in the risk of death by starting Jakafi earlier versus placebo followed by Jakafi or best available therapy followed by Jakafi.","So we think we've penetrated the prevalence in the United States by about 25% to 28%. And we think we have a long way to go in myelofibrosis, particularly to benefit those patients who might start therapy earlier.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Alethia Young from Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your question.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on a good quarter. Just one around that new ASCO SITC conference in February. Do you think that's a potential venue where we could get some more clinical information for epacadostat?","And the second one. I just wanted to talk a little bit about the duration of treatment for Jakafi? I just wanted to see if like you kind of are starting to see kind of increased duration with kind of some of the longer term data that you've been presenting? And then also on p-vera [polycythemia vera], just wanted to \u2013 wanted you to talk about the same trend there as well. Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Alethia, it's Steven. Re the ability to present epacadostat at various meetings, that is an interesting meeting. And our eye is on it. We in general will not speak to whether things will be at the meeting until the meeting itself releases its abstract data. So I'll just leave it at that. And pass it to Barry for your second question.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager US","Yeah. We've talked about persistency for both MF and PV. Continues to get better year over year for both MF and PV. I think I've said before that the PV persistency is a little bit longer.","Obviously we look to our Phase III clinical trials as one signal. And in fact in both response and in COMFORT-I, COMFORT-II, the patients stay on therapy for a long period of time. So we try to keep patients on therapy, because we think they'll continue to benefit. Obviously the survival benefit that we've shown in myelofibrosis and then in terms of symptom control and seize control that we've seen in response and response to, we think this persistency will only continue to get better.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tony Butler from Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Thanks very much for taking the questions. So I would love to get your view on the GITR agonist, especially potentially in combination with, say, an anti-PD1. Given the notion that there are a number of inflammatory events that may occur with PD-1 alone, perhaps pancreatitis, stemonitis (36:20), et cetera. So the question really is, do you get \u2013 do you think you may get or obtain excess -itis, whatever -itis, simply because you're adding effectively two agonists together? Would love to understand that view.","And then second, with respect to bladder cancer on the FGFR inhibitor, really around selectivity, given that there are a couple of other competitors in the market with FGFR inhibitors? And more importantly, why bladder cancer first is a first line? I recognize there are a number or a percentage of bladder cancers, which certainly have FGFR3. But the question really is why bladder cancer first? Thanks.","Reid M. Huber, PhD - Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. Hi, Tony. This is Reid. I'll take both your questions, and Steven can chime in with additional comments at the end.","I think first with respect to GITR, it's \u2013 and we're learning a little bit more about the agonist space after this last ASCO, including data presented on the OX40 agonist. But there's an outstanding I think question in the field up until these clinical data, as to what the ultimate safety profile and tolerability may be of a co-stimulatory agonist.","And the data at least emerging thus far from OX40 and maybe soon to emerge around GITR is encouraging in that respect. So that's the first thing to note. And I think that's important for the field to recognize, is that these antibodies appear to be able to be delivered, at least as single agents, as safe treatments with early signs of pharmacologic or pharmacodynamic activity.","As you know the ultimate utility of these antibodies, based on preclinical data, is likely in combination. And you referenced the PD-1-based combinations, which are clearly attractive combination approaches for both GITR and OX40. It's where our program is certainly designed to move to. And we think that the most relevant go\/no-go decisions and true understanding of safety and efficacy is probably going to come from data emerging from those combination regimens.","Whether there is an inflammatory or an -itis type toxicity is yet to be determined. But certainly the monotherapy data is encouraging. And then we're going to have to look for the actual clinical combination data to speak to that, because as you know preclinical data doesn't really read on safety.","On your next question with respect to FGFR, 54828 was brought forward \u2013 designed to and was brought forward, because it's a very selective inhibitor of three FGFR isoforms, FGFR1, R2, and R3. And those are the receptor tyrosine kinases that are often mutated or translocated and activated in a number of solid tumors. Bladder cancer is one where the genetics are particularly clean with respect to FGFR3 involvement. And we have a very attractive path forward there through it with a companion diagnostic approach to identify those patients.","So it's an interesting one to accelerate the program around. I don't think necessarily it is the only one. And there are of course other tumor types which harbor FGFR amplifications, which we may be able to pursue as the program evolves. But certainly out of the gate, bladder cancer is an attractive one for us.","With respect to the competition. There are a number of other FGFR inhibitors out there. The first group of them were actually very non-selective inhibitors. And more recently over the last few years, we've seen from Novartis and J&J and AstraZeneca more selective FGFR inhibitors.","One important feature of our program that we were focused on in the Phase I setting was whether or not we would only be dose limited by on-target pharmacology, namely phosphate elevation. Or whether like some of those other inhibitors I mentioned, we may have off-target dose limiting toxicity.","And we've been very pleased with the safety and tolerability profile thus far in Phase I. And we think that's allowing us to push to quite high levels of pathway inhibition, perhaps high enough to begin to differentiate across some of those other molecules in development. But obviously it's still early days. And the clinical data will ultimately speak to the quality of the profile.","Tony Butler - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you, Reid. That's helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Simos Simeonidis from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question.","Simos Simeonidis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, guys. Thank you for taking the question. This has been I think kind of asked earlier in a different way. But what I wanted to get your thoughts on is, whether you're currently doing anything differently post the \u2013 surprise to many people \u2013 failure of the Bristol drug in front line lung cancer in your trials with PD-1, PD-L1 inhibitors in lung cancer?","And the second question is, I know Mike Booth has communicated in the past how you guys will talk to us about which combinations you might take into next steps with epacadostat. But is it still going to be in a staggered fashion? Is it going to be all at once? And then we get the data? Is there any changes to that? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Simos, hi. It's Steven answering your question. I think in terms of first-line lung cancer, and this is more a general comment. Sometimes it can be advantageous to not be out front, because you can learn from other data sets, not necessarily failures but just other data sets. And in this case I think at least in lung cancer as opposed to melanoma, the quantitative intensity of the staining may be more important than it is in other histologies. And where the cut-offs lie and how they inform your drug and its activity is going to be really, really important.","So the obvious answer is, yes, we will be looking in depth at the biomarker parts of the lung cancer program and trying to understand where we differentiate on efficacy? And where we add, is it at the same cut-offs or different cut-offs? And that work's in progress at the moment.","In terms of combinations, and I'll let Reid add to this. It's really, it's wide open. We will look at different levels of evidence. There's preclinical cell line evidence, then xenografts, and then clinical evidence, either from ourselves or collaborators, and where we will work in both hot and cold tumors and in combination in terms of enhanced in other compounds.","The majority of the program right now is on PD-1 and PD-L1 combinations. But there are others in development, including triplets, where we look at our own small molecules in different dosing schedules to see if we can modulate the tumor marker environment by looking at paired biopsies and enhance immune responses.","And then we have a vaccine program as well in combination with vaccines. And it's not step-wise. I mean we're willing to look at things as soon as the evidence is available. And we remain very confident in that opportunity. I don't know, Reid, if you want to add anything around combinations. But hopefully that answers your question.","Simos Simeonidis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please proceed with your question.","Morgan T. Haller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey. Good morning. This is Morgan on for Cory. I just wanted to ask a quick question on the data presentation at ESMO. You've referenced potentially for us to see PFS data. Are we going to see medium PFS? Or are we going to see any sort of percent PFS at certain time points?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Morgan, it's Steven. Obviously, wait for the presentation is the high level answer. Again it's on poster discussion on Monday, October 10. If you look at the SITC and SMR data sets, we now have additional scan data. And we'll be able to look at progression free survival over a much longer time interval. As for the actual data, I'll refer you, one, to the abstract when it goes live on September 28, and then the actual presentation.","Morgan T. Haller - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey. Good morning, guys. I have a question on whether you have any preclinical data or clinical data you have seen so far, that's not a float to show, there's a row for IDO (45:13) inhibition for PD-L1 negative or even the low expression of PD-L1 tumor types.","And then secondly, I was wondering if you can provide any more color on the decision by your partner, Lilly, to drop a couple indications, including diabetic nephropathy, and then move on for another two indications, including atopic dermatitis and lupus. Thanks.","Reid M. Huber, PhD - Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer","Yeah. Hi, Ying. I'll start off with your first question. This is Reid on the preclinical data. So IDO has been studied in a number of tumor models now. And they really range across both what we think of as hotter, more inflamed tumors, and tumors which are characterized by less of productive immune cell infiltrating more of a myelosuppressive or immune suppressive immune cell infiltrate.","The reproducibility of IDO synergy with PD-1 is a very common finding. We in fact see it when tumors are IDO1 positive. We see it impact when tumors are IDO negative, where the IDO activity may be coming from the infiltrating immune cells and from the tumor draining lymph node.","So I think that data set is a fairly robust one. The question is, how those models translate to patients? And there as you well know, we have to be much more cautious in either over or under interpreting the preclinical data.","So the approach that Steven has outlined and we're following with the ECHO program is to not to limit histology selection and the expansion cohorts to only those which have been shown to be PD-1 responsive or only those which are characterized by cold tumors or PD-L1 negative status. We tend to look at both of those. And then use a more robust translational program on the back end to work through those details. I think that's a strength of the program going forward. So we're not biased based on any pre-clinical \u2013 pre-conceived notions, and I'll turn the next question over to Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yes. Concerning the Lilly relationship. I mean you have to remember that the way it works is that we would be asked at some point when the program is going to Phase III to either opt in or not in co-financing of the Phase III.","Before that we are literally in a position where we give our opinion and our advice. But we are really not in any kind of decision position, so I cannot comment on their willingness to go for any of these indications. But as we said, I think we are dealing with a very broad list of possible indication for this mechanism. And really \u2013 and we are discussing with them about it, are certainly looking at multiple places where baricitinib could be applied. I mean the decisions to drop nephropathy recently, something that was not a huge surprise from our side.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Peter Lawson from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Lawson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Steven, just with the BMS failure. wondering if you could walk through the biomarker strategy you have around epacadostat, as well as GITR and if there's any points of differentiation you have in that biomarker strategy? And how you could potentially drive positive outcomes with the strategy?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Peter, hi. It's Steven. I cannot speak to the specifics of each collaboration and granular details on the biomarker strategy. Just to tell you that it's broad. So it's beyond immunohistochemistry and staining and quantitative staining intensity. And we're looking other aspects, including the genetics of the space and trying to get a comprehensive understanding of where therapies work and why they don't.","Obviously the cutoff per se in the first line lung of the one compound at BMS versus Merck's compound in interesting. Is it 5% or 50%, and what that difference means? And then looking at it in combination. And then the same for GITR. We have a comprehensive program, but it's too early to give you any specifics.","Peter Lawson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And just a follow-up around that. Is there a chance that you can go back and change the cutoff rate, manipulate that? Or are you kind of locked in?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","So in terms of the exploratory part of the program now, it's hypothesis generating. So it's not a question of changing anything. We can look respectively across the board. When you trigger a prospect of Phase 3, then you have to prospectively set what you're going to be looking at.","Just to be clear our melanoma's Phase 3 ECHO-301 doesn't use any selectivity in terms of PD-L1 staining. And that's not really relevant in the melanoma space at the moment. But there's no cutoff in the Phase 2 programs. It's we're doing across the board hypothesis testing.","Peter Lawson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming Ren Benjamin from Raymond James. Please proceed with your question.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Good morning and thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on a great quarter. I guess one question for Barry. Barry, can you give us a sense at all or any color regarding the split of MF versus PV? And you mentioned the 6% prescription increase in the quarter. Is that growth coming from one indication more than the other?","And then one for Steve, just regarding the IDO studies, will you be presenting the data based on the trials as a whole or specific to these cohorts? So for example, would you present data from ECHO-2O2 and ECHO-203, the triple negative breast cancer, all at the breast cancer conference at the end of this year, but from two different trials?","And I guess final question regarding bladder cancer. Can you give us any sort of detail or color? Is it muscle invasive, non-muscle invasive, or superficial? Or in combination with BCP?","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager US","Hi, Ren. In terms of a breakdown of MF and PV, we still have more sales in MF, just because the total cohort of patients that we had over time, they continue to grow. As I said before, the persistency is good.","But in terms of growth quarter over quarter, it's a greater \u2013 PV is now \u2013 the total number of PV patients' growth is outpacing the total growth of MF patients. But they're both still growing quarter over quarter. And we think we can actually increase that going forward, particularly for the overall survival in MF and now additional data in PV.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager US","Steven?","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Ren, it's Steven for your second and third question. In terms of when and where and how to present the IDO data sets, it's really a case-by-case discussion with our partners and the investigators. To date, we've generally presented studies as a whole. So if you look at SITC last year, the ECHO-202 experience, and then what's coming up at ESMO this year.","But going forward, there may be opportunities around histologies. It's just too early to speak to whether for example, you do a single histology, other histology relevant medians, like a breast median. But again it's a discussion with our partners and investigators.","In terms of bladder cancer the current program is directed at metastatic bladder cancer. It's not superficial or non-muscle invasive. The unmet need in the metastatic setting at the moment. We will going forward look at potential other areas to study. But that's where the program is at the moment.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ian Somaiya from BMO. Please proceed with your question.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. And congratulations on a great quarter. I had two questions. First for Herv\u00e9. Just want to get your sense, I mean just your ability \u2013 do you think you have the ability to at this point continue to aggressively fund your growing oncology portfolio, as well as take advantage of the options that you have in terms of the baricitinib program? And just (54:01) question just related to your financial health. Do you think you can do both at the same time?","And then separately for Reid. I was just hoping to get your thoughts on some of the early sort of microbiome data that's been published? And potential for combination with the different I-O's programs?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, Ian. Herv\u00e9. So, yeah, on the financial heath, I mean you can see the numbers yourself. I mean what \u2013 we are in a position where the growth of the top line is giving us a lot of flexibility to invest in our own portfolio. And if Lilly would decide to go in additional indication, which I wish obviously, we would be able to also do the co-funding.","To give you an idea, from last year to this year, in fact the co-funding of the Lilly program has gone down, because of the cycle in rheumatoid arthritis. So if we were to go in new indication, there would be no problem to do that.","I mean the way we are thinking of resource allocation is obviously top line growth is what's giving us all of these opportunities. We spoke about ruxolitinib, but we have also now hopefully if baricitinib is approved next year, there will be a new line of top line growth from the royalties and some of the milestone from Lilly.","We think about portfolio kinetics, how to move the portfolio as fast as possible in the right indication, obviously based on the scientific understanding we have. So we are not limiting our clinical program, because of resource constraints at this point.","Based on what you have seen this quarter, you can see we have room to maneuver. And obviously we stay in a positive cash flow from operations. I mean that's important, because that's sort of what makes us stable from the financial standpoint for \u2013 and able to do this operation.","So that's the three criteria that we are using. And up to now, it has been there something we can \u2013 we have been able to manage very positively. So the answer is yes. If there were opportunities to do co-funding with Lilly, we would probably participate, assuming the indication is reasonable.","Reid M. Huber, PhD - Executive Vice President, Chief Scientific Officer","And, Ian, this is Reid. I'll take your second question. So I think \u2013 so our view of the microbiome data are that they're very interesting. Obviously some of it has come from a close collaborator of ours, Dr. Tom Gajewski at University of Chicago.","It's not an area which we have built a particular expertise around. So I think we look at the data and how it emerges in the context of our combination possibilities, much like we look at other platforms, such as vaccines or cellular therapeutics. Some of these may emerge as interesting tools. And when they emerge into the clinic, we'll always evaluate the science behind them, and how we may be able to work together in those sorts of combination strategies.","But right now I think it's a little bit early to assign any real strong scientific rationale to specific combination possibilities that may be appropriate for us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is a follow-up from Michael Schmidt from Leerink Partners. Please proceed with your question.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks for taking my follow-up. I just had one. So you mentioned the importance of PFS information and assessing the efficacy of epacadostat in combination with JAK1 inhibitors. And just wondering, number one, looking at the upcoming data at ESMO, can you just remind us of the benchmarks of what would you expect for PD-1 alone in terms of PFS in those patients?","And then secondly, PD-1 inhibitors historically have been, I believe at least, most efficacious in prolonging overall survival, as opposed to PFS. And I'm just wondering what your thoughts are here in terms of the \u2013 sort of the PFS as a measure that you're considering. Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah. Michael, it's Steven. It's one of the three components of progression free survival or time to progression. The benchmarks, if you look at pembro alone and generalizing, because you have to be very specific about exactly what population you look in. And then are you enriching for particularly biomarker expression.","But in general if you look at their label in melanoma, you're looking at about 6 months for pembro alone. If you look at nivo plus ipi in the same setting, you're looking at about 11.5 months for that combination. And then obviously with efficacy, you always weigh in toxicity in terms of getting to your risk elements sort of equation in terms of using therapies. But those are the numbers we bear in mind in terms of getting there. And again I'll refer you to the actual presentation.","From a tolerability point of view, to date, our data is very encouraging versus other doublets. You're right. In terms of overall survival, that is ultimately what is most important to patients and often to regulators. You just can't wait in terms of decision making early on to wait for OS, and they're not \u2013 they tend not to be randomized studies. So you use surrogates like response and progression free, which we feel is most important in terms of decision making.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks for the follow-up.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Herv\u00e9 for any further or closing comments.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Thanks, all of you, for time today and for your question. And just conclude saying that we look forward to providing you with further data, where our Q3 call in early in November. And for now, thank you and goodbye.","Operator","Thank you. That does conclude today's teleconference. You may disconnect your line at this time, and have a wonderful day.

Mr. Murphy, please go ahead.","Pamela Murphy","Good morning and welcome to Incyte\u2019s second quarter 2014 conference call. On the call today are Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, President and CEO, Jim Daly, Chief Commercial Officer, Dave Hastings, Chief Financial Officer; Rich Levy, Chief Medical Officer and Head of Drug Development; and Reid Huber, Chief Scientific Officer.","Herv\u00e9 will begin with a brief overview of the quarter, Jim will follow with an update on Jakafi, and Rich will highlight progress made across our development portfolio. Dave will then describe our second quarter financial results, after which we will open up the call for Q&A.","Before beginning, we\u2019d like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations for the commercialization of Jakafi, our development plans for Jakafi and other indications and for other compounds in our pipeline and our expectations for net product revenues. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2014 and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents. Herv\u00e9?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you Pam and good morning everyone. Thank you for joining this call. Let me begin by stating how please I am by our great progress and commercial momentum with Jakafi in MF, as well as the rapid regulatory and clinical advances that Incyte is making across our development pipeline.","As you see the field of oncology is evolving at very high speed and we are in a position, in a comfortable position in the transformation of cancer treatment of treatment of cancer patients. So first, commercially phase of Jakafi continues to grow reaching $84 million in Q2 and as Jim will highlight today, we have raised our full-year on net product guidance from $315 million to $335 million to a range of between $330 million and $340 million.","As announced earlier this week the FDA has approved the inclusion of updated safety and dosing information of our survival data into the Jakafi label. So regarding PV, while we did studies to meets its primary endpoints the sNDA has been submitted based on the pivotal data from RESPONSE. And we are confident that the results that we need are not required for FDA approval and we continue to believe that Jakafi has a potential to be an important new treatment for patients with uncontrolled PV.","We are implementing our strategic development plan in the area of onco inflammation we have initiated two Phase III studies for ruxolitinib in pancreatic cancer, as well as three Phase II studies over ruxolitinib in other solid tumors. Regarding immuno-oncology we have no signs per-clinical trial agreements for our IDO inhibitor, so most recent of which Genetech was announced yesterday and we have already initiated the clinical trial of 24360 in combination with Merck\u2019s anti-PD-1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab.","In addition, Novartis and Eli Lilly continued to move our products forward, the royalties we receive from Novartis on ex-U.S. sales of Jakavi rose by over 100% in Q2 2014 of our last year. And in addition, Jakafi has recently been approved in Japan, figuring the payments of 25 million milestone to Incyte.","We expect Lilly to share results from Phase III trial of Baricitinib our JAK1, JAK2 Inhibitor which is in development for rheumatoid arthritis beginning later of this year and to 2015. Now, I\u2019ll pass to Jim, who will provide more details around our commercial accomplishment with Jakafi.","Jim Daly","Thank you, Herv\u00e9 and good morning everyone. Our second quarter net product sales of $84 for Jakafi reflect continued growth, underlying demand in intermediate and high-risk myelofibrosis. Year-over-year net sales grew 55% and quarter-over-quarter sales grew 21% with the following components to change relative to the prior quarter.","Underlying demand as measured by bottles dispensed to patients grew by 12%. Net price increased 8% driven by both the price increase on April 1st and a seasonal improvement in gross to net. Inventory increased by 1% and inventory in the channel remains at the low end of the normal range of three to 3.5 weeks. As a result of the first half year performance trends, we\u2019ve increased our 2014 full year net product revenue guidance from the previous range of $315 million to $335 million to an updated range of $330 million to $340 million.","Our Jakafi net sales guidance assumes no meaningful contribution to revenues in 2014 from a potential FDA approved indication in PV. We believe the increased underlying demand in the second quarter reflects the continued effective execution of our commercial strategy to grow Jakafi intermediate for high-risk MF. Expansion of our field force earlier this year has led to a significant increase in promotional activity and educational programs.","The debt and breadth of prescribing continues to increase. There is an improved understanding of Jakafi efficacy regardless of JAK2 V16, V617F half mutation status as well as the importance of individualized dosing. And finally the overall reimbursement environment for Jakafi continues to be favorable. The vast majority to payers manage Jakafi consistent with the label, physicians are able to successfully manage most prior authorizations that exists and the majority of patients are able to afford their out-of-pocket cost. We continue to see MF as a source of sustainable long-term growth for Jakafi. With an addressable population of at least 15,000 patients with intermediate to high-risk MF, we have less than one-third of these patients currently on Jakafi, while nearly 70% of target physicians have prescribed Jakafi for at least one MF patient. These physicians typically have additional MF patients in their practice or diagnosed and are appropriate candidates for treatment with Jakafi.","These watch and wait patients are generally considered to be stable based upon blood counts, but in reality are experiencing a debilitating and worsening symptom burden that corresponds to the progression of the underlying disease. The primary focus of our commercial strategy today is on earlier treatment with Jakafi. As the question for most physicians is not if Jakafi should be used, but when it should be used in the course of the disease.","Our educational efforts are directed at highlighting and reinforcing the benefits of earlier treatment with Jakafi versus waiting for decline and blood counts as a trigger to initiate treatment. Last week\u2019s FDA approval of the Jakafi label update, which contains the Kaplan-Meier\u2019s survival curves and tables providing the probability to survival at one, two and three years from COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II and expanded safety and dosing information all meaningfully adds to the totality of the data available for Jakafi and supports our discussions about when to appropriately begin treatment with Jakafi.","Turning now to our next new indication for Jakafi, we believe the unmet need in polycythemia vera is clear that represents a major commercial opportunity and that PV should make a substantial contribution at Jakafi sales in 2015 and beyond.","Market research indicates that the primary treatment goal in PV is the prevention of thrombotic events through consistent and durable control of Hematocrit. Secondary goals include symptom improvement, spleen volume reduction and controlling leukocyte and platelet counts. Based upon claims data there are at least 100,000 patients in the U.S. diagnosed and treated for PV. Two large chart audits that we\u2019ve conducted as well as independent publications supported about one in four or 25,000 patients in the U.S. had inadequate response to or intolerant of HU. As indicated by a lack of consistent Hematocrit control. These 25,000 patients with Hematocrit consistently above 45% have uncontrolled PV and represents the unmet needs in the addressable population for Jakafi.","Based upon the results of the response trial we\u2019re confident in the ability of Jakafi to deliver consistent from durable Hematocrit control that is superior to best available therapy. We should know in early August when we have a priority or standard FDA review and we will be fully prepared to launch Jakafi as the first and only FDA approved treatment for PV as early as December of this year.","As we look at the PV market compared to MF, the addressable patient population is substantially larger. Additionally, the broad base of positive physician experience with Jakafi and MF should help up take in PV. Also relative to MF, we believe that PV launch will be more straight forward in terms of diagnosis, mutational status and dosing. 95% of PV patients have the JAK2 V16F mutation and whereas a drop in Hematocrit is undesired in MF is actually a treatment benefit in PV.","Finally based upon age and health status, we would expect a longer duration of treatment in PV, VAN and MF. Conversely, the urgency to treat in PV may be less than MF and we expect there will be significant educational requirements during the launch phase, leading to a more gradual ramp in sales with less [Indiscernible] effect than we saw in the MF launch. That said, we remain confident that MF and PV combined represent a $1 billion opportunity for Jakafi in the U.S.","We\u2019ve always said that MPNs (ph) are just the beginning, we have a deep pipeline of novel programs that represented exceptional opportunity to make difference for patients. To discuss this in more detail I\u2019ll turn it over to Rich.","Rich Levy","","Thanks Jim and good morning everyone. As Herv\u00e9 mentioned in his opening remarks the development team here at Incyte has made rapid progress across the portfolio and I\u2019ll now give you some additional color on the key items. Earlier this week, we announced the updated safety and dosing information as well as overall survival data has been added to the myelofibrosis pathogens for Jakafi. ","Kaplan-Meier curves from COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II now put in label. In COMFORT-I, the probability survival for patients initially randomize to receive Jakafi and Placebo where 70% and 61% respectively in three years with survival probabilities at one and two years also provided in the label. Similar presentations are given for COMFORT-II we\u2019re at three years the probability of survival was 79% and the group initially randomized to Jakafi and was 59% in the group initially randomized the best available therapy. The meeting times to cross over were nine months for the group randomize to Placebo and COMFORT-I and 17 months for the group randomize the best available therapy in COMFORT-II. And the revised label also provides new information and dosing, specifically, it indicates that among patients randomized to Jakafi with baseline platelet counts between 100 and 200 times per liter who started dose of 15 milligrams per day 65% required a dose reduction in the first day of week.","This information should allow insights to provide more guidance to healthcare professionals on the expectations for dose adjustments during the first two months of therapy. The revised label also indicates that among patients randomized the Jakafi was baseline platelet counts greater than 200 times tenth to the ninth per liter, who started the dose of 20 milligram-- only 25% required a dose reduction during the first two months.","The revised label also provides information on symptoms after discontinuation of Jakafi and updated information on monitoring for tuberculosis and modified language on drug interactions. Overall, we believe that the changes to the label will provide useful information to healthcare providers to decide if and when to initiate therapy in their patients with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis, helped to monitor their patients and adjust the doses of Jakafi as appropriate. They\u2019re moving from MF to polycythemia vera and as Jim highlighted, the primary goal on PV as hematocrit control and the data from our pivotal response trial so that ruxolitinib provides rapid and durable Hematocrit control to patients with PV.","These data were presented at ASCO by Dr. Verstovsek and are available on our website. Incyte submitted the ruxolitinib of sNDA for the treatment of uncontrolled PV in early June of this year and we expect to be able to update you shortly on the acceptance for filing along with what are the PDUFA data based on a six month or 10 months of year.","The results of release study were not included in the sNDA and we\u2019re confident that efficacy results from release are not required for FDA approval. Further analysis of the release are underway, these analysis will seek to evaluate what factors may have contributed to the symptom control rate for patients on stable dose of the unstable doses of hydroxyurea they were significantly higher than that seen in the best available therapy arm of response.","With this difference that led to an under powering of the release trial. We expect to present a full data from this release study and upcoming scientific meetings. The two other data fixing (ph) compounds represented at ASCO in June. These presentations are also available on the Incyte website and have led to acceleration of our onco inflammation and immuno-oncology development activities.","Based on the results from RECAP our Phase II study of ruxolitinib in combination with capecitabine and second line metastatic pancreatic cancer it was presented at ASCO by Dr. Hurwitz initiated two Phase II trials in pancreatic cancer and several proof-of-concept trials in other solid tumors.","JANUS 1 is a double-blind placebo-controlled Phase III trial in advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer and is being conducted under SPA. This trial was initiated in March. JANUS 2 is almost identical to JANUS 1 and was initiated in second quarter of this year. Each trials expected to enroll about 300 patients with high levels of systemic inflammation is measured by C-Reactive Protein or CRP and the primary end point for both trials is overall survival. The three randomized double-blind Phase II proof-of-concept trials are ongoing in small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer with overall survival of the primary endpoint in each study.","The positive subgroup analysis from RECAP have added to our comp and its pursuing accelerated clinical development were inside 39110 the first of our JAK1 inhibitors in solid tumors. 39110 is currently in a Phase II trial in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer we\u2019re on track to begin a second Phase II trial in lung cancer later this year.","We are currently conducting dose binding studies with JAK1 inhibitor 39110 and also was ruxolitinib in combination with gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel sold as Abraxane to find the optimal starting dose for a possible trial in first line trial of pancreatic cancer. The third ASCO presentation was given by Dr. Gibney and this described initial positive proof-of-concept data with our IDO1 inhibitor 24360. This is a trial in combination with ipilimumab and patients with unrespectable or metastatic melanoma. These data show that the combination of our IDO1 inhibitor plus ipilimumab were generally well tolerated and suggested that response rate and time to progression were longer than historical data with ipilimumab alone. The synergistic activity observed with 24360 and ipilimumab as well as support three clinical data increases our confidence in the values investigating 24360 in combination with other immunotherapies including PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors and we\u2019ve just added Genentech\u2019s anti PD-L1 MPDL3280A to our list of clinical trial agreements for IDO. The purpose of this agreement is to evaluate the combination in patients with non-small cell lung cancer.","We\u2019ve now begun dosing patients in study called KEYNOTE-037, the combination study at Merck\u2019s by PD-1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab or previously called MK-3475 and INCB24360. Phase 1 portion of the trail will define a recommended combination regimen and the Phase 2 portion will evaluate the efficacy and safety of that regimen in a randomized population of non-small cell lung cancer patients receiving pembrolizumab combined with either Incyte 24360 or its matching placebo. Incyte is conducting the study in close collaboration with Merck.","Phase 1\/2 trials of 24360 in combination with AstraZeneca\/MedImmune anti PD-L1 MEDI4736 and Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2019s anti PD-1 nivolumab are expected to begin in 2014. These two studies will have the potential to recruit patients of multiple tumor types and be run by Incyte. As we said we see the potential for our IDO inhibitors in combination with checkpoint inhibitors but not necessarily as monotherapy. As a result of both slow enrolments and lack of evidence and efficacy advantage as monotherapy over controlled arm tamoxifen, we\u2019re closing our Phase 2 study in ovarian cancer. Going forward we will focus development of our IDO inhibitor as a component of combination therapy.","Now looking briefly at a couple of our other programs; let me first give you a short update on the Incyte\u2019s 47986 our second selected JAK1 inhibitor that is in development for inflammatory disorders. Based on recent preliminary preclinical toxicology finding, we have proactively placed clinical studies of 47986 on hold while additional preclinical study data are gathered. These preclinical findings have not been observed any of our JAK1 or JAK1\/2 inhibitors such as ruxolitinib or baricitinib which is being developed by Lilly.","Our PI3-K delta inhibitor 40093 has completed Phase 1 monotherapy dose escalation trial and patients with B-lymphoid malignancies and has moved into the expansion phase. A second trial which started in January of \u201814 is evaluating for 093 in combination with our JAK1 selective inhibitor 39110. As we previously noted these are distinct mechanisms of action and they exhibit synergy in pre-clinical models of lymphoma.","And lastly on baricitinib, the rheumatoid arthritis program being run by Lilly, this is ongoing in the first of four Phase 3 trials is due to read out with top line data later this year. So Phase 2 psoriasis and diabetic nephropathy programs are also ongoing, initial results for the psoriasis trial was presented at the American Academy of Dermatology in March and the results of the diabetic nephropathy trial anticipated in 2015.","With that I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Dave to give us some financial highlights for the quarter.","Dave Hastings","","Thanks Rich good morning everybody. Let\u2019s begin with Jakafi for which we recorded $84 million of second quarter net product revenues representing 55% growth over the same period last year. Additionally, we reported $12.3 million in product royalty from Novartis for sale of their Jakafi outside the United States which is more than double from the same period last year. Now Novartis also continued to make progress and obtaining normal pricing and reimbursement approval for third major European country. Now, once Novartis achieves this Incyte earned an additional $60 million milestone payment which is expected to occur in the second half of 2014.","In addition and as previously announced, Incyte earned a $25 million milestone from Novartis in July as a result of Jakafi\u2019s approval in Japan. This will be recorded at contract revenue in the third quarter. Our gross and net adjustment for product revenue recognized was approximately $9.5 million or 10.2% for the second quarter. We still expect that our full year growth net adjustment will range from 9% to 10%. Our cost of goods sold for the second quarter was immaterial as we continue to benefit from the fact that our starting finished goods inventory was previously expensed as R&D prior to FDA approval.","In terms of operating expenses both R&D and SG&A were within our expectations. And finally from a cash perspective, we ended the quarter with $509 million. Our cash position continues to benefit from increasing product and royalty revenue which allows us to appropriately invest in our growing development pipeline.","So with that operator that concludes our formal remarks. Please open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","","Thank you. At this time we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions). Our first question today is coming from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","","Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on a commercial progress with Jakafi, may be it for Jim in terms of the updated label on OS and safety, do you expect that to have an impact on sales trends or this is just more another sort of competitive barrier down the road should feature JAK next to market. And then just a quick one for Dave it looks like SG&A is running a little bit above the annual guidance in R&D a little bit below, is it time to adjust our thinking on those ranges.","Jim Daly","","Hi Eric this is Jim. Eric to answer question both the facts are true I think it will help us to increase the overall breadth of prescribing I think for current prescribers the new label should motivate them to look for patients with what\u2019s obvious what\u2019s advance disease and I think longer term it does represent a significant hurdle for new competitors to try to meet to come to the market. It will obviously take the competition years to build a three year Kaplan-Meier\u2019s survival curve.","Now in terms of trend rate our view is we\u2019re not expecting a trend rate based upon the label update. Now with the low prevalence disease was often rate limiting for physicians to act upon new information how long it takes for them to see their next MF patients. And as result, as a best case scenario I would not expect any type of trend break or step change in terms of performance.","David Hastings ","","In terms of R&D and SG&A we\u2019re comfortable with the current range of guidance provide for both areas I mean traditionally for our R&D spend we do tend to see a slight hockey stick (ph) in the second half and I would expect that to continue and SG&A is tracking final.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Josh Schimmer from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray","","Thanks for taking the question maybe sticking with the expense scene. How should we think I guess magnitude was about the increase in SG&A that will be incurred with the PV label and launch. And then separately it seems like it will be difficult to avoid profitability with these milestones coming in the second quarter so how should we think about the fully diluted share count and that happens? Thank you.","Jim Daly","","Hi Josh this is Jim. Josh I would now anticipate a major increase in SG&A with respect to the PV launch. We have already incurred the sales force expansion cost and there is a lot of synergy between MF and PV in terms of our promotional support for the new indication. So I would not build in a major step increase in expenses corresponding to launch.","David Hastings","","And Josh you know these milestones can be lumpy in nature and you\u2019re right in any given quarter particularly the quarter-over-quarter 60 million there is a possibility for profitability and then when you think about fully diluted share at that point that use the treasury stock method and that would take into account both employee stock options but ones that are considered diluted and the convertible debt.","Josh Schimmer - Piper Jaffray","Can you help us with that map?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","Sure. So if you think about sort of the fully diluted both converts were exercised and our employee stock options were exercise it ranges somewhere between 205 million and 210 million. But there are some new launches in that calculation where you add back interest expense and then for employee stock options you utilize the treasury stock method. So it would be slightly lower than the fully diluted count.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Matt Roden from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Roden - UBS","","Great, thanks for taking the question and graphs on a nice quarter. I have one question on the commercial side and then another follow up if I may on the pipeline. Jim on the commercial you mention that the growth in demand this quarter was driven by MF. Can you comment on whether or not the growth in spontaneous adoption outside of MF has sort of kept pace with that or whether or not the proportion of sales coming from spontaneous adoption is lower this quarter? And then related on the guidance it looks to me like the last six quarters you\u2019ve done about on a average 7 million sequential in sales growth quarter-over-quarter basis your guidance implies from doing the math rate something like 2.5 million to 6 million per quarter for the rest of the year.","So are you, is this just conservative or more is there some fundamental reason for us to think that maybe the sequential trends will split on the second half.","Jim Daly","","First on the non-MF sales, that is a percentage of overall sales is remain relatively constant over the last several quarters so we have not seen any type of increase proportionality in our non-MF sales. With respect to the phasing of the guidance the low end represents a low single digit growth rate for the rest of the year and high end represents a high single-digit growth rate for the rest of the year. Listen Matt our goal is trying to beat the guidance that\u2019s always our goal but we think that high single-digit growth rate represents a reasonable base case scenario that is both ambitious and achievable.","Matt Roden - UBS ","","Okay, great. Just on the IDO program, now that you have vibrations with the four major players in PD-1, PD-L1. Can you give us a little insight into what the collaborators are saying when they come to the table about IDO and the combo data from ASCO? Do you think they\u2019re interested in committing resources just because of the mechanism or is the data or is it both? Just trying to get a sense for what industry people outside of Incyte think about 360 and whether and to what extent that program can help them?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","It\u2019s difficult for me to comment on what other companies believe or tell us in private conversations. But I would say in general the fact that we have four major either PD-1 or PD-L1 and they have all now signed collaboration agreements with us shows that across the board there is interest in combining with the IDO inhibition mechanism and in addition I think it shows that no one wants to be left out of that game by not playing at the same time. So I think they all think that there is a good potential for the combination. And now it\u2019s time to get the data for each of those individual combinations.","Matt Roden - UBS ","And do you have a sense Rich when we should expect to see the first data from those collaborations?","Rich Levy","","In part because each of these companies are competing with each other in terms of this and that release of data has to be mutually agreed between us and the other party. And I don\u2019t expect that we will be giving out emerging data the way we had in our combination with ipilimumab. So there is two parts to the studies first defining doses which is uncontrolled and potentially as we have done before with ipilimumab to comparisons to historical controls. How long that takes depending upon how many dose levels that we need to get to before we fairly have the right doses in each study. And then randomized controlled second part to the study which will take longer to roll out.","So we\u2019re not giving specific guidance as to when but it\u2019s not going to be in the very near future.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan & Chase. Please proceed with your question.","Whitney Ijem - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","","It\u2019s Whitney on for Corey. Wondering if you guys have any insight into how Lilly will be releasing the baricitinib data? Whether they intend to sort of top-line events they it or hold it until they have it all to release it?","Rich Levy","They have not given us specific guidance as to their plans. These are Phase 3 studies and I am sure they will need to pay something about information that is material to them, but what that actually is I don\u2019t know. We expect based on what they told us that there is a likelihood that there will be some top line data on the first study sometime towards the end of the year.","Whitney Ijem - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","And then on PV, I guess you guys reiterated your expectations for MF plus PV to be about $1 billion opportunity. But does the sort of release mix change the way you\u2019re thinking about the commercial potential in PV at all or what type of patients might come on drug?","Jim Daly","","This is Jim, it actually does not. We knew that we would not have the release data when we filed the response sNDA. So all along we knew that we would not have a symptom claim at launch. I think the key point -- we will clearly know it\u2019s a negative study, so that\u2019s always a disappointment but if you\u2019re going to have a negative study that was the one to have. Because the primary goal in PV is control and the data contained in response gives us the promotional evidence that we need to go after the vast majority of those one out of four patients who are on controlled.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Jim you mentioned that out of the addressable MF intermediate and high risk MF population, you are not quite a third or you are less than a third penetrated, given the survival benefit indication or information now on the label. What penetration do you think is potentially possible here in this group? And are there subsets that you think are really not likely to be just Jakafi.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","That\u2019s a challenging question. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve left it at a billion dollars between both PV and MF. Clearly, you are never going to get 100% of your addressable population. But at a third we would certainly believe that a 50% penetration is realistic and is clearly within our ambition to do that. So as we look at the billion dollars, we don\u2019t know if it\u2019s 600 million with MF and 400 with PV or 500. But clearly the message we want to communicate is that we do have substantial long-term upside in MF.","Steve Byrne - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And a question for Rich. You have four of these combo studies with IDO and there is some redundancy among them seems to be at least including non-small cell lung, is it your view that there could be some mechanistic differences between the two PD-1 and the PD-01 or are you more or less cashing this fairly broad and looking at lot of different indications, is there a view of this you can share.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","We are not at this time, we have no reason at this point to believe that there are differences between the two PD-1 and PD-1 and remains within whether in combination, with we will even see significant differences between the PD-1 and the PDL-1. So the strategy here is to be a partner with a range of checkpoint inhibitors in immunotherapies and not higher so down to one thing. And in fact while there is some redundancy particularly around non-small cell lung cancer which is interest to everyone by having different partnerships, we do get to explore a range of potential indication and depending upon initial data this potential to add indications beyond those that are currently plan. ","So I think it gives us a broad look at the possibilities for combination with PD-1 targeted therapies. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Michael Schmidt from Leerink. Please proceed with your question."," Michael Schmidt - Leerink ","","Hi good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I had a couple of pipeline questions. Number one, based on emerging mechanistic understanding of how JAK pathway is involved in solid tumors, particularly do you have plans or what are your plans to evaluate your JAK inhibitors in targeted drug combinations and solid tumors in addition to ongoing studies. Number two, we just talk about the PD-1 PDL-1 combinations of the IDO inhibitor, based on the understanding of the mechanism of 24X360, what difference is or do you expect any differences between PD-1 versus PDL-1 combination? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","So I will start and maybe Reid has some additional comments. So first of all in terms of targeted therapies in solid tumors we\u2019ve already started study with ruxolitinib and with what deliver them and survivor in colon cancer which is targeted therapy. and we do have others plan with solid tumors they have not been announced yet and nothing with that ruxolitinib or 39110 but with JAK inhibitors and other targeted therapies are planned and we\u2019ll talk about that when they\u2019re closer to starting.","And then in addition, we\u2019re of course interested in JAK1 inhibitors with other targeted therapies in immunologic malignancies with combination of JAK1 and our PI3K delta in b-cell malignancies as an example of ongoing study. And with respect to PD-1 and PDL-1 I mean as I said in answer to earlier question there are three radical reasons to believe that they may be very similar or difference in what this have to generate the data and our view has been that we will do the studies and find out.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink ","","And one more will you present any additional data from the ipilimumab combination study before next year\u2019s ASCO.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","I don\u2019t know probably ASCO is a reasonable time for an update I don\u2019t know that it would be going any specialty meetings or anything like that.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink ","Got it, great, thank you. ","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Navdeep Singh from Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Navdeep Singh - Goldman Sachs ","","Hi guys congrats on the progress during second quarter. And thanks for taking my questions. So just a couple of questions on Baricitinib maybe a question for Rich. Rich can you help us better set expectations for the upcoming Baricitinib Phase III data. I understand that you\u2019re not - in your Phase III trials you are not comparing Baricitinib [Indiscernible] but based on the Phase II data how should we be expecting that because safety profile of Baricitinib to look like for Xeljanz compared to Xeljanz.","And then a question for Jim, Jim what have you guys and Lilly learned from the Zell Jen plant that mixing more confident that you can execute better than them? Thanks.","Jim Daly","","So there a number of different Phase III studies that are ongoing, including study in patients who have previously felt on TNF or have response to TNF inhibitors in a few studies in DMARD or methotrexate responders. I think one of the key studies is the largest study which is head-to-head comparison was not only continuing that the truck phase but also -- includes methotrexate.","The study is large and is also the structure study. You\u2019ll get head-to-head comparison with Imuran in terms of signs and symptoms as well as structure which is something that was not present in the structural studies done by Pfizer. So I think there are two key things that could lead to a differentiation, one is the safety profile and by avoiding JAK3 there are still reasons to believe that this has in Phase 2 and may very well in Phase 3 the differentiation. The structure study has been made larger with the powering based on the results of the Pfizer study and then again it\u2019s the ability to have a head-to-head comparison, where of course there is not a head-to-head comparison to Xeljanz per say. And I\u2019ll turn it over to Jim to talk about commercial aspects.","Jim Daly","","We defer to Lilly in terms of all aspects of commercial execution, but just to address your question in RA it\u2019s all about the product profile. I mean today the three largest selling drugs in the world last year were Humeral, Remicade and Enbrel. And that is both good and bad, it\u2019s good that it represents a tremendous opportunity, it\u2019s bad and that they are going to defend their business very aggressively and if there is a weakness or vulnerability in your product profile it will be exploited and the issue which Xeljanz is that from launch with the 5 million BID dosing they had, perceive weakness with respect to the claims that Rich has referred to the claims to inhibit progression of structural damage.","That structure claim is absolutely vital if you\u2019re going to compete successfully against the biologics. Now if you come in with a competitive clinical profile and you have the added convenience of one a day oral we think that can be a very successful product.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Thomas Wei from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co.","","Just wanted to ask an immuno-oncology question and then maybe a Jakafi question as well. On immuno-oncology front just wanted to get your latest thoughts on your interest in developing biologics capabilities acquiring other immune checkpoints. And then on Jakafi we\u2019d love to get some of the metrics that you provided before in the past in terms of mix of doses as well as on persistence.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot ","Sure on persistence again we can see a steady and significant increase in persistence over time. That\u2019s driven by two things, one is we\u2019re seeing an overall healthier patient being put on Jakafi as judged by their base line platelet counts and hemoglobin levels. And secondly, we\u2019re seeing physicians becoming more fast in the dosing. We\u2019re seeing increased use of titration and we\u2019re also seeing an increased use of lower strength doses.","So we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made on the persistence front and because it\u2019s a moving target we\u2019ve refrained from trying to quantify it and I think we\u2019ll remain with that position.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","Herv\u00e9 here, question on the moving on field of immuno-oncology in general. I must say the first priority for all of us to successfully develop our IDO inhibitor where we\u2019re 14 plus and where we have an original mechanisms that has a lot of promising potential currently. So that\u2019s really is the number one.","Now evolving in the field of immuno-oncology doesn\u2019t necessarily mean biology, in fact PI3-kinase delta field is a place that seems to be moving from targeted to immuno-oncology as we speak. So that certainly is something of interest and we have, we\u2019re looking at small molecules of potential way to address some of the medical needs with the mechanism in the field of immuno-oncology. And obviously probably like everybody else we would be looking at external opportunities at similar we do get internal opportunities which is the science around it and how does it fit with our overall portfolio strategy but it\u2019s still not number one item on our priority list today.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Liisa Bayko from JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","","It is John for Liisa, thanks for taking the question, I have two. First you talked a little bit about the casting of wide net with IDO partnerships and I am wondering if you can comment all about your plan to transition from that strategy to a more focused strategy as you hopefully end up getting some hits with different companies. Is there anything you\u2019d be looking for in a long-term partner besides a combination that works?","And then second question more of housekeeping thing. I think you may have commented on this earlier but we missed it. Can you say anything about the contribution of inventory to the revenue numbers for Jakafi this yearend expectations for the second half on inventory side.","Dave Hastings","Inventory contributed 1% to the overall 21% growth in the second quarter. We ended the quarter at the low end of our typical range of three weeks to 3.5 weeks. And last year if you remember we saw inventory build about $4 million in the fourth quarter, we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s going to be recurring action or not this year and as result we do not build that into our guidance.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","Regarding the philosophy behind the partnerships is really old science, what we are doing now is finding which indication if there are difference between indications for which product you throwing a reason there are differences between the PD-1 and the PDL-1 will be better if they need for combination what they do, now if it\u2019s another case I mean we find that the mechanism is across different indication on across different product. Frankly our goal is to develop ideal independently and to have variable that we declaring that it\u2019s a drive that should be use and could be use in combination with multiple partner. ","So the partnerships we have today are not sort of across before a bigger set there in Italy scientific partnerships, regulatory partnerships but when we find the proof of concept under right indication that could lead to approval of ideal in combination with multiple products and multiple indications that\u2019s the goal that we\u2019re pursuing and we would see the commercialization of that product as being done by insides.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Dave Friedman from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed with your question.","Dave Friedman - Morgan Stanley","","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just as I look at the Jakafi U.S. volume demand trends over the past six quarters it seems like at least in 2013 you had 2Q from a volume basis about double every other quarter and now you\u2019re seeing a similar thing here, is there something that happens in 2Q either from Medicare perspective or something else that you guys are aware of that could explain this front.","Jim Daly","","Dave, this is Jim. Dave there is natural rhythm to the business and we\u2019ve seen that over the last couple of years now. Particularly the first quarter will be challenging, we will have headwind in the first quarter and that\u2019s due to a number of factors it including running out our inventory built that you may have had in the fourth quarter, it includes the phenomenon where patients may full forward in prescription from January and the December in anticipation of having new deductibles, reentering the donut hole and you can also have the friction dealing with plan changes in the first quarter. So the first quarter is challenging and then we see a very nice rebound in the second quarter we saw that last year we see that this year, you have prepared for a slight slowdown in third quarter as you deal with quite frankly a doldrums, it involves things as vacations on the position and patients or new patients visits we\u2019ll tend to flatten out I think you see a strength in the fourth quarter and again that can be reflection of patients going forward and that prescription we can\u2019t, last year we did see some inventory build and so that\u2019s kind of the rhythm in the business that we\u2019re anticipating as we plan our phasing.","Dave Friedman - Morgan Stanley","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Yaron Werber (ph) with Citi. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst ","","Hi this is Kevin in for Yaron this morning, thank so much for taking question. So I wanted to congratulate you on the great launch in the upcoming expansion in PV, a quick question on what are the trials you\u2019re planning for bar fitment (ph) and also if you could elaborate a little bit on the safety signal that you saw in 47986 and if this was something particular to RA or just the molecule itself. Thank so much.","Reid Huber","","Thanks for the question, this is Reid. Just in terms of safety signal. In a longer term no road in toxicology stay we indentified two instances of retinal toxicity which had histologic features that we\u2019re consistent with the generation, the finding was not observed in rodent studies nor was it observed in the 28 day studies that enabled the filing of the IND. I also point of that we have not observed this retinal toxicity with any of the other JAK inhibitors that we\u2019ve taken forward that includes importantly ruxolitinib or Baricitinib in 39110.","We\u2019re currently gathering more data from the study animal that includes the control animals to determine whether the finding is likely to be treatment related but at this time we thought that -- from investigators of the finding we\u2019re actively put on hold the 986 trial while those other data are gathered. I will make the additional point that 47986 is from a distinct chemical scaffold -- relative to other JAK inhibitors and at this time we consider these filings to be a potential relationship to that drug and therefore possibly arising from off target activity.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","And on baricitinib we really can\u2019t comment beyond what and has been announced by Lilly so they presented the results of first part of their Phase 2 study in psoriasis, obviously they presented their rheumatoid arthritis studies some time ago the diabetic nephropathy study is scheduled to read to out and we presented in some form next year. There are four Phase 3 studies ongoing in RA and in addition to that there is also long-term extension study beyond that we\u2019re just not at liberty to say what they\u2019re either going to do or the types of things they\u2019re thinking about.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Bret Holley from Guggenheim. Please proceed with your question.","Bret Holley - Guggenheim","","Just a quick question on PV. Just wondering what percentage of PV patients in the U.S. as you receive hydroxyurea. And how confident are you really in the 25,000 estimates in the United States. What sources of information are you using to arrive at that number, because I sense a bit of skepticism out there on that number.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot ","Bret it\u2019s about 60,000 patients in the U.S. who are on HU or have been on HU. About 5,000 patients were on HU and discontinued due to lack of efficacy or tolerability issues. 55,000 patients remained on HU and in terms of the one out of four we\u2019ve really triangulated on that through some published studies and we can share those with you off line as well as chart audits that we\u2019ve conducted ourselves. So we\u2019re feeling very confident that one out of four is a reasonable balanced estimate if the opportunity.","Operator","Thank you. If there are no further questions at this time I would like to turn the floor back over to management for any further closing comments.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","","Thank you. I think, I mean what you saw in the Q2 report is a lot of progress on many fronts first the commercial momentum is very good in that. We have on the regulatory side the PV that has been achieved in also Q2 and as you see on the development front we\u2019re moving forward also very fast very aggressively both in onco information and immuno-oncology with our IDO program and in addition we\u2019re in a very good and strong financial position. So when you look at this Q2 result as being extremely positive from our strategic objective spent. Thank you for attending the call.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mike.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Kevin. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's second quarter 2018 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com. Steven is not able to join us this morning as he is currently recovering after a bicycling accident this weekend. So, I'm joined on the call today by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Reid and Dave who will deliver our prepared remarks and by Peter Langmuir and Lance Leopold from our chemical group, who will participate as needed in the Q&A session.","Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2018 guidance, the commercialization of our products and the development plans for the compound in our pipeline as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to deliver materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents.","We'll now begin the call with Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. So, on slide 4, I'd start with the growth of the organization and the financial strength. So, we have continued our strong start to 2018 in the second quarter by delivering 29% year-on-year growth in product-related revenues. This dynamic top line growth is driven by four sources of revenue, where second quarter sales of Jakafi increased 25% over last year and Iclusig grew by 27% year-over-year.","Royalties increased by 61% over the same period last year as we begin to see the effect of Olumiant commercialization in addition to the strong ongoing performance of Jakavi ex-U.S. Today, we reported a balance of cash and equivalent of $1.2 billion, which allows us to progress our portfolio while affording us the flexibility to be opportunistic in business development. Our reported cash balance at the end of June does not include the recently triggered $100 million milestone from Lilly following the U.S. approval of Olumiant for RA.","Moving to slide 5, Jakafi and Jakavi have already provided significant benefits to thousands of MPN patients and maintaining our leadership position in MPN is allowing the imperative for Incyte as we seek to drive additional benefit in this patient population. We believe there are multiple avenues that we might be able to pursue to expand our leadership position in MPNs beyond the next decade.","We are already working on new potential formulation for ruxolitinib monotherapy. We are assessing ruxolitinib-based combination strategy and we're also working internally and with collaborators on MPN targets beyond JAK inhibition. An example of our approach to ruxolitinib-based combination is our ongoing trial evaluating ruxolitinib plus 50465.","We have recently presented preliminary data for this combination, which showed that adding a delta inhibitor to ruxolitinib could bring additional benefits for refractory MF patients and we have also filed patent application for this doublet that would, if granted, provide additional patent protection for this treatment of myelofibrosis patients.","Slide 6 illustrates our vision for Incyte in the future, which is led by our diverse development portfolio with multiple candidates being evaluated in later-stage clinical trials. We have several near-term opportunities such as ruxolitinib and itacitinib in GVHD and our FGFR inhibitor in cholangiocarcinoma and bladder cancer. That, if approved, has the potential to add meaningfully to our top line growth in the next few years.","Looking a little further out, we are pursuing later-stage compounds across a total of 15 new indication and our earlier-stage portfolio could also provide us with additional important optionality. I'm confident that we have the right team in the appropriate geographies to deliver transformational revenue growth.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Barry for an update on Jakafi.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. Jakafi continues to perform very well with net product revenue of $346 million in the second quarter of 2018, representing growth of 25% over the same period last year. Sales continued to be driven by robust prescription demand and in the second quarter, we saw a year-on-year increase of approximately 16% in total patients being treated with Jakafi.","We are very happy with our sales performance in 2018 to-date and are pleased to reiterate our Jakafi net product revenue guidance for the full year of 2018, which is a range of $1.35 billion to $1.4 billion.","Following the positive REACH1 result we announced last month, we are preparing the sNDA submission to the FDA, seeking approval for Jakafi as a treatment for patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD. The sNDA is expected to be submitted before the end of the third quarter. We have breakthrough designation from the FDA, which we expect to provide us with a shorter review period. If approved, we will be ready to launch Jakafi in this new indication immediately.","Our field force has already been optimally sized and structured in anticipation of approval and the map on the left hand of slide 9 shows the areas where we will be focusing our efforts should approval be granted. Allogeneic stem cell transplants are largely concentrated across the top centers in the United States.","For example, the top 10 centers by volume conduct nearly 30% of transplants and the top 50 centers, which are shown here, conduct about 70% of transplants. Our team is currently preparing for this potential launch by developing robust plans for these key accounts as well as appropriately engaging with payers and reimbursement authorities for coverage upon launch.","I'll now pass the call over to Reid for an update on our portfolio.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Barry, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to use my time today to briefly touch on some of the important takeaways from our recent Investor & Analyst Event as a means of summarizing progress across the development portfolio.","We continue to work hard to satisfy the needs of MPN patients. We're addressing this through both discovery and development initiatives and have also partnered with key academic centers and companies in order to extend our efforts. The objectives here are to improve patient outcomes, reduce disease burden and, where possible, improve hematologic tolerability.","Our collaborations with Syros, Moffitt and Vanderbilt seek to discover new targets and new combinations that may yield benefits to patients and we are already aiming to improve outcomes through ongoing clinical trials of ruxolitinib-based combinations.","Last month, we shared some early but interesting data from the ongoing ruxolitinib plus PI3Kinase-delta trial in refractory MF patients and we look forward to sharing additional data from this and other combinations when available.","PI3Kinase-delta inhibition is a potent therapeutic mechanism with the potential for broad application across multiple diseases. At our Investor event in June, we touched on multiple areas where 50465 could provide benefit to patients, both as monotherapy and in combination with other agents.","Slide 12 highlights two of our later-stage programs in oncology. Firstly and as part of the COMFORT clinical trial program, evaluating ruxolitinib-based combinations in MPNs, we are testing ruxolitinib in combination with 50465 in patients with refractory myelofibrosis. We presented early data from 10 patients last month which showed that most patients had improvements in both spleen lengths and in their disease-related symptoms. Updated data are expected later this year.","The CITADEL program is evaluating 50465 monotherapy in follicular lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma. In Phase 1, we were encouraged to see rapid, deep and durable responses in these three diseases, but we also observed immune-related and likely on-target toxicities after several months of therapy. We have since adjusted the dosing regimen, which appears to enable patients to remain on therapy and hence continue to benefit from the potent activity of the molecule. We look forward to sharing these data as they become available.","In June, we announced that REACH1, the pivotal trial of ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease met its primary endpoint. This trial is important for a number of reasons. First, it is the only prospectively designed pivotal trial of a JAK inhibitor in graft-versus-host disease to be completed. And second, these positive data add to the growing body of knowledge of the benefit of the inhibition of JAKs in GVHD.","We are working with Novartis to recruit patients into REACH2 and REACH3, the two ongoing pivotal trials of ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute and steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease respectively.","At the same time, we are also recruiting patients into the GRAVITAS program, which is evaluating itacitinib, our JAK1 selective inhibitor, in newly diagnosed GVHD patients. REACH2, REACH3 and GRAVITAS-301 are all expected to read out next year.","On slide 14, we summarize the clinical trial schema for our FGFR inhibitor, which is now known as pemigatinib. Last month, we presented initial data from the FIGHT-202 trial in FGFR2 mutated cholangiocarcinoma. These results showed a disease control rate of 82% and an objective response rate of 24%, which included 11 PRs as well as a 6.8-month median progression-free survival.","With second-line chemotherapy, generating an objective response rate of less than 10% and a PFS of approximately three months, we are excited about the potential impact of this compound in this setting. Should the data warrant, we are planning to file an NDA with the FDA in 2019. Therefore, pemigatinib has the potential to be the first selective FGFR inhibitor approved in cholangiocarcinoma.","As previously announced, we are also planning to adjust the FIGHT-201 study in FGFR3 mutated bladder cancer to include a continuous dosing arm. We expect that this regimen may enable a greater degree of patient benefit and data from the continuous dosing cohort are expected next year.","FIGHT-201 may support an initial regulatory submission in the U.S. for second-line patients and our ultimate intention is to develop pemigatinib as a first-line treatment for patients with FGFR mutated bladder cancer.","Development plans for our PD-1 inhibitor are detailed here on slide 15. We have completed recruitment into dose escalation and initial dose expansions and recently declared our intent to run three registration-directed development efforts. The cohort of patients with microsatellite instability-high endometrial cancer will be further expanded at a 500-milligram every four-week dosing schedule.","And in addition, we are planning to open Phase 2 studies in merkel cell carcinoma and anal cancer later this year. We're also planning to evaluate 012 in a number of combination settings. Leveraging our own portfolio, we are planning combination studies with both small and large molecules. We expect that having an in-house PD-1 antagonist will speed our decision-making and could obviate the need to either buy supply from a third party and\/or to share any plans or data with them.","By capitalizing on our drug discovery and immunology expertise, Incyte is establishing a specialty-focused business in inflammation and autoimmunity. Following positive Phase 2 data of ruxolitinib cream in atopic dermatitis, which are expected to be presented at the EADV meeting later in September, we are currently preparing to initiate a pivotal trial in this indication. Additionally, a Phase 2 trial in patients with vitiligo is ongoing and we expect to be able to announce data from this trial in 2019.","We believe that 54707 is a differentiated JAK inhibitor due to its selectivity as well as its longer half-life compared to ruxolitinib or itacitinib. We've initially chosen to study 54707 in hidradenitis suppurativa, which is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by lesions in the axilla, in the groin and under the breast area as a result of inflammation and infection of the sweat glands.","Lastly, we are interested in studying delta inhibition across a variety of B-cell mediated and antibody-driven diseases outside of oncology. We feel that there's a potential to differentiate from CD20 antibodies based upon the mechanism of action and the ability for reversible suppression versus long-lasting depletion. We expect to begin proof-of-concept clinical trial work later this year.","Slide 17 shows our full portfolio, illustrating our three drug discovery platforms on the left, our four sources of revenue on the right and our robust group of post proof-of-concept assets in the later-stage portfolio. While most investor focus is rightly on these later-stage molecules, it's also important to recognize that the optionality inherent in our earlier-stage portfolio.","I won't go through each molecule, but I will say that we are pleased with the progress that these programs are making. As expected, our LAG-3 antagonists recently entered dose escalation trials and both TIM-3 and AXL\/MER are slated to enter the clinic in the coming months.","We continue to make data-driven clinical decisions, being prepared to terminate programs as we have done recently with both JAK1 and AML and our BRD program, while also being prepared to make rapid go-forward decisions where appropriate.","I'll now pass the call along to Dave to review the financials.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Reid, and good morning, everyone. The financial update this morning will include GAAP and non-GAAP numbers. For a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP, please refer to our press release.","Our financial performance in the second quarter was very strong. We recorded $522 million of total revenue on a GAAP basis. This was comprised of $346 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $20 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $47 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis, $9 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly and $100 million of contract revenues from the milestone earned from Lilly for the FDA's approval of Olumiant. Total revenue for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis were $422 million and exclude the $100 million milestone from Lilly.","Second quarter Jakafi net sales of $346 million represents 25% growth over the same period last year. In second quarter, Jakavi royalties of $47 million represents 39% growth over the same period last year. Our gross net adjustment for the quarter was approximately 13% and we expect that gross net adjustment for full year 2018 will be approximately 14%. Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $19 million on a non-GAAP basis. This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig and the payment of royalties to Novartis on U.S. Jakafi net sales.","Our R&D expense for the quarter was $253 million on a non-GAAP basis, primarily driven by clinical development programs. The $13 million decrease in non-GAAP R&D expense in the first to second quarter is primarily due to lower costs associated with our epacadostat program. Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $96 million on a non-GAAP basis, which is lower than the first quarter due to donations to independent charitable foundations, which typically decline as the year progresses.","Moving on to non-operating items, we recorded GAAP to non-GAAP net interest income of $6 million in the second quarter. Our net income for the second quarter on a non-GAAP basis was $57 million. Looking at our year-to-date results, our net income on a non-GAAP basis was $54 million.","A quick comment on the balance sheet, we ended the second quarter with $1.2 billion in cash and marketable securities, excluding the $100 million milestone from Lilly for Olumiant, which we expect to receive in the third quarter. We expect to end the year with a slightly higher level of cash and marketable securities.","Slide 23 provides a summary reconciliation from GAAP to non-GAAP metrics. As I mentioned, a more detailed reconciliation is provided in this morning's press release. The next slide provides a summary of our current financial guidance, which is largely unchanged from the prior quarter.","And Herv\u00e9 will now conclude our prepared remarks by summarizing our upcoming expected newsflow.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Dave. So, slide 26 summarizes our current expectation for data readout over the remainder of the year. First, we are expecting Phase 2 data from ruxolitinib topical cream in mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis to be presented in September at EADV. And we are expecting to report additional pemigatinib data in patients with cholangiocarcinoma and bladder cancer at ESMO. Later in the second half of 2018, we are expecting to present the REACH1 data for ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease as well as updated data from the study evaluating 50465 in combination with ruxolitinib in patients with refractory myelofibrosis.","I'll close with our exciting schedule of protected regulatory submission in the coming years. We have the potential to submit a total of six product candidates for approval in up to 15 indication over the next five years. And while we have a lot of work to do to execute on this plan, we are encouraged by the data we have shared with you so far and we look forward to sharing additional data and updates from our program as they evolve.","In the second quarter, we delivered strong product revenue growth and I believe that we are very well positioned from both a revenue and clinical perspective to build sustainable value for all our stakeholders.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instruction and open the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Certainly. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer sessions. Our first question today is coming from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan Chase. Your line is now live.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Two of them for you. I guess first one, I wanted to ask about the combination work you're doing in MPN, so bigger picture. So, in addition to providing an improved option for your existing patients, do you believe this also opens up a material number of new patients to your therapies while also, I guess, potentially extending your overall runway? I guess I'm getting at how much of this market remains untapped at this point and how far do you think you could possibly extend that runway? And then, I have one follow-up.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Sure, Cory. It's Barry. So, we think that we could, in fact, extend the duration of therapy for patients who are on Jakafi by combining with some of our pipeline products, like our delta product, for example, where patients who are getting an inadequate response perhaps to Jakafi or are progressing on Jakafi could now be recovered and get a better spleen response in MF. So, we could certainly stay on for a longer duration of therapy and perhaps even provide them significant improvement, maybe even survival advantage for those patients if we can complete these studies with PI3K-delta, itacitinib and so forth.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Cory, maybe I can add something. I mean the big picture here is that, obviously, Jakafi is the only FDA-approved product there for MF and PV. We believe there is still a lot of progress that could be made and we see, for us, as the leader in this field, an opportunity to expand the duration of treatment, as Barry was describing, potentially to provide an option for patients where today there is no option after Jakafi failure or where patients cannot be treated with Jakafi.","And all of that together, as we are looking at new targets, as we are looking at fixed-dose combinations, as we are looking at new formulations, is going to give us a position that will expand potentially our leadership in MPN beyond the Jakafi single-agent option that is available today.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. All right. Great. And then, my second question is for Reid. You mentioned with regard to your FGFR program or pemigatinib, I think, you're calling it that you would file in 2019 should that data warrant. I guess I'm wondering what else you need to see in the data beyond what's been disclosed or maybe what kind of feedback you need from KOLs and\/or regulators to move ahead with that filing. Thanks.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Cory, for the question. This is Reid. I'm going to hand it over to Peter for him to address the regulatory activities around FGFR.","Peter Langmuir - Incyte Corp.","So, good morning. Thank you for your question. Basically, what we've seen so far from the cholangiocarcinoma data, interim data, so basically we need to complete recruitment to that cohort of 100 patients, evaluate the final response rate and then, importantly, look at the overall duration of response in these patients as well. So, that's sort of the main totality of the data that we'll need to support a potential file next year.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Salveen Richter from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now live.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. So, first question is around Jakafi and itacitinib. Just given you've got both these drugs targeting acute and steroid-refractory populations, how big do you think this GVH opportunity could really be?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Well, so, for Jakafi, at least in the United States, obviously Novartis is going for the approvals outside the United States for steroid-refractory acute and chronic GVHD. In the United States, for Jakafi, for the acute and chronic, we estimate the steroid-refractory population is about 1,500 patients apiece.","For the steroid-na\u00efve patients with GVHD globally, at least in the major markets, Japan, the United States and Europe, it's about 15,000 patients. So, depending on duration of therapy, you can imagine \u2013 you can calculate what the Jakafi value would be for GVHD, steroid-refractory GVHD and then, for itacitinib, it's a much larger opportunity for us.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. And then, just in terms of topical ruxolitinib, I know we're going to get an update at EADV coming up. What additional data are we going to get versus the EASI score and the IGA responder analysis that you provided at the Analyst Day?","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Salveen. This is Reid. So, we'll have a more complete description of all the trial results. That includes those scores over time. There's some other scoring indices that are used in this space. We'll describe those. We'll be describing, I think, many of the components, parts of those scores, which are important to patients and give you a sense of overall safety across the topical ruxolitinib as it relates to increasing dose versus both the vehicle cream and the triamcinolone cream. I think you'll have a good perspective coming out of that of the potential of the drug in the mild-to-moderate patient indication as well as the safety profile.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Ying Huang from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now live.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a high-level pricing question. So, in 2017, you took two price increase of 6% each for Jakafi. In your $2.5 billion to $3 billion peak sale guide or estimate, how much price increase did you bake in and do you think that's realistic in today's environment?","And then, secondly, maybe for the clinical side, on PI3K-delta program, given the data you have observed so far in the Phase 2 program, how differentiated do you think this compound is from existing PI3K drug such as Zydelig in toxicity? Thank you.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","So, thanks, Ying. It's Barry. I'll take the first question. And going forward, we don't talk about, or we've never talked about our strategy around price increases, but you can still figure for modest price increases going forward.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. And Ying, this is Reid. I'll take your question around PI3Kinase-delta. We've described this a few times. 50465 is a very potent molecule and has a structure that is quite distinct from idelalisib. And one of the important features that that structural modification has made is it's eliminated or significantly minimized any hepatotoxicity risk. And as you know, that's been a characteristic liability for idelalisib. It tends to occur over the first few months of dosing and leads to a discontinuation rate and a dose attenuation rate. We've yet to see that and we think that's a testament to the structural modifications, the molecule \u2013 that's been made to the molecule.","Second, the tolerability around on-target toxicities that tend to occur later in dosing and these are typically GI toxicities manifesting as nausea and diarrhea and are believed to relate to an alleviation of immune suppression in the gut, just through chronic PI3Kinase-delta inhibition. So, what the team has done, I think in a very clever way, very nicely is constructed an induction and a maintenance regimen where patients are treated at a reasonably high dose over the first two months of therapy and generally patients are brought into response during that time period.","And then thereafter, they're shifted to a dose or a schedule attenuated regimen and that allows them, we think, to maintain response, but be able to tolerate the therapy long term. So, I'd say in sum, the differentiation comes both from the intrinsic properties of the molecule, but importantly also from the way that the team has gone about constructing this dosing schedule and developing the drug up to this point.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you. Very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Katherine Xu from William Blair. Your line is now live.","Yu Katherine Xu - William Blair & Co. LLC","Good morning. Just wondering what catalysts from the pipeline you think could move the needle to improve investor sentiments, especially following the epacadostat setbacks. So, the other question, for Reid, for the PI3K-delta inhibitor, can you comment on the activity in ibrutinib failures? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Maybe I can take the first part and Reid can also comment on the catalyst question. You can see from the product portfolio, the way it's developing, that there is a lot of attention given to GVHD. We have the largest program in the field. It has a lot of potential from the medical standpoint to literally transform the practice of medicine in this field, because it's a very important curative procedure for cancer patients and the largest drawback is GVHD.","And we think by transforming that, it can have obviously a positive effect for patients, but also it can create a meaningful opportunity in term of top line growth for Incyte and we have short-term ruxolitinib ongoing with a filing in the next few weeks and then, we have obviously itacitinib data that will be available next year. So, that's important.","I would say, I mean if you look at our FGFR inhibitor, our PI3Kinase-delta, we spoke about it, it has as a lot of different dimensions. It can go in multiple directions. And then, something that we have just disclosed, which is our efforts outside of oncology, so it's starting with atopic dermatitis, but it has a number of other indications where we are doing now at the clinical research and in the case of atopic dermatitis, we are planning to be in Phase 3 in the next few months and that can also have a very meaningful effect on our revenue growth over the next few years.","So, it is a situation where there are multiple opportunities, meaningful opportunities for Incyte with relatively short-term newsflow that would be driving the strategy there. So, that's really the way we are looking at it.","I don't know, Reid, if you have any additional...","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","No. I'll take your second question on the delta inhibitor. So, in short, we are studying both patient populations, both those that are na\u00efve to ibrutinib and those that have progressed on ibrutinib or prior BTKs. I would say up till this point, the data are relatively limited. So, I can't say too much other than to make the point and I think we've presented this in prior meetings that we have seen in responses post-ibrutinib, as you know that can sometimes be a very acute situation in those patients that progress \u2013 often progress with some very aggressive disease. But we have noted some clinical benefit and even responses in those patients, in both the marginal zone lymphoma as well as the mantle cell lymphoma trials that are ongoing as part of the CITADEL program.","We are including patients that were previously treated either with or without a BTK inhibitor. So, I think as those data mature, we'll be able to make a more definitive statement as to what the potential is for PI3Kinase-delta inhibition post-ibrutinib.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Geoff Meacham from Barclays. Your line is now live.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hey, guys. Good morning. Thanks for the question. I have two, mostly on the pipeline. For rux for GVHD, I wanted to ask about the strategy of filing on REACH1, does this speak to the unmet need or do you think it's worth it to wait for a stronger profile when you have REACH2 data or even waiting for chronic patient data with REACH3? And then, I have one follow up on FGF.","Peter Langmuir - Incyte Corp.","So, good morning. This is Peter Langmuir again. Our feeling is that the data from REACH1 clearly identify a benefit and meet the unmet need in patients with steroid-refractory acute GVHD. And so, our goal is to file on those data. The REACH2 study is obviously a larger study in the same setting comparing versus best available therapy that's being conducted in rest of world. But again, we believe that the REACH1 data provide compelling evidence of activity in this setting.","The REACH3 study is being conducted in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD. So, that's a different, though, related disease and we hope that that will be a separate file later on once we have data from that study.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And then, on FGF and bladder, can you guys talk about the opportunities for differentiation that you see thus far with erdafitinib, this J&J's product? And how much of a leading indicator do you think that cholangio could ultimately be when you look to the bladder on things like response rates?","Peter Langmuir - Incyte Corp.","So, the bladder work is still ongoing. As we've reported, we have some interim analysis data looking at an intermittent dosing schedule and we're now moving to a continuous dosing schedule to try to improve the outcomes in those patients with bladder cancer. So, we'll need to wait for the data from that, which will be available next year to see how we differentiate from J&J.","But in cholangiocarcinoma, as we talked about the interim data look promising and so if those data continue to look promising and we're able to show a good durability responses, we have the potential for being first-in-class in cholangiocarcinoma.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","And, Geoff, just to add little bit on the molecules, I think the selectivity profile of pemigatinib, it's a little bit cleaner across the isoforms, particularly for FGFR4. That may minimize any diarrhea or nausea risk that could come from spillover to that isoform. So, we'll have to see how the safety profiles emerge over time. That's probably a little bit of a subtlety in the safety profile, but one that could be meaningful for patients, especially if you think about ultimately this class of agents moving to the first-line setting.","As Peter said, I think we have a very good chance to be first-in-class in cholangiocarcinoma. We're very excited about that. It's a meaningful opportunity in an area of unmet need. And I think we're probably a little bit behind in bladder cancer, but with the movement to continuous dosing, we have every reason to believe that the merits of pemigatinib as a high-quality molecule will show at the end of the day when we get the full efficacy and safety data in.","Geoff Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Jay Olson from Oppenheimer. Your line is now live.","Jay Olson - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Oh, hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a question about the GVHD launch preparations. You mentioned that you've been having some preliminary meetings with payers. Can you just talk about sort of feedback from payers that you've gotten from those meetings? And then I have a pipeline question.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Sure. This is Barry. We had some market research with payers. We've had some advisory boards with payers. And we have to take a lot of time to explain GVHD both acute and chronic steroid-refractory, steroid-na\u00efve patient populations. But once they understand that this is an unmet medical need and a very limited patient population, we don't see any barriers that would be put in place with payers \u2013 from payers.","Jay Olson - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks. And then, just to follow up on pemigatinib in bladder cancer, since PD-1 antibodies are not recommended in the first-line setting for PD-1 low bladder cancer patients, do you know what percent of bladder cancer patients with FGFR3 mutations are also PD-L1 low or negative?","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Thanks. This is Reid. So, it's almost a mutually exclusive population. So, patients with FGFR3 mutations are translocation. So, that's the patient population that we would be targeting with pemigatinib. About 85% of those patients are either PD-L1 low or negative. It's only a minority of 10% or 15% of patients that actually have PD-L1 high status.","Obviously, that has bearing for how we think about moving into the first-line setting and what kind of trial design. You can imagine some interesting dynamics that you just referred to as we now learn from regulators across the globe that the PD-1 axis blockade is not recommended for those patients. So, I think that gives us some opportunities, but we haven't finalized any specific plans there, but we hope to share those details with you once they become available.","Jay Olson - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Brian Abrahams from RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now live.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Hi, there. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on all the progress and I wanted to just pass along my best wishes to Steven for a speedy recovery. A couple of early-stage pipeline questions, maybe for Reid. Wondering if you could provide any update on the partnered bispecifics programs and how those are progressing.","And then, we also noticed you recently have been filing a number of patents for a set of oral PD-L1 inhibitors with some interesting mechanistic and preclinical data. Just wondering if you might be able to comment on the status of that program, when it might enter the clinic and perhaps how it might be differentiated from the anti-PD-1 antibodies. Thanks.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Brian. This is Reid. Thanks for the questions. So, I'll take your second one first in terms of the patents that you referred to looking at PD-L1 binders. So, you are correct. We do have a series of patents that are out there that are available on the web. As you well know, we don't comment on our preclinical stage research. So, I would leave it at that.","I will say, though, with respect to our small molecule efforts as well as Merus the first part of your question, we're very excited by the near-term products and our later-stage preclinical pipeline. And I think as we get through the coming months and quarters, I think we'll have a few new agents that we'll be able to talk to you more about and describe. That will include both the small molecule as well as the first bispecific coming from the Merus partnership.","Both \u2013 the Merus effort is just over a year old now and I'll say that it's a very healthy collaboration. We have a robust pipeline of preclinical-stage programs moving forward, one of which is nearing the IND stage. And I think it's living up to all the hope and potential that we had going into the relationship and I think, for us, going forward, it's an area of significant innovation and kind of creative white space that we can access new pharmacology that otherwise wouldn't be able to be achieved through small molecule means or even through standard monoclonal antibody methodology.","Brian Abrahams - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Carter Gould from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. I guess, first off, you touched a little bit on it earlier, but I was hoping you maybe just zero in a little bit more how you guys are thinking about the clinical, the hurdle for 465 plus rux and sort of, I guess, the hurdle for moving that into a Phase 3 study, specifically on spleen volume and total symptom score.","And then, separately, for Herv\u00e9 and David, just your latest thoughts on how you guys are thinking about the importance of demonstrating EPS growth from here. I know during the epacadostat days, you were more willing to circulate (41:27) investment, but maybe just now how that thinking has changed, particularly now as you've shifted clearly into profitability again? Thank you.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Carter, this is Reid. So, I'll start and Peter may have some things to add on 50465 plus ruxolitinib. That trial design is studying patients who are refractory to ruxolitinib in the first-line setting. So, these are patients that have had at least six months of dosing with ruxolitinib, have been on a stable dose for eight weeks and still, unfortunately, have either a palpable spleen or a significant disease-related symptom. And so, you can imagine that's an area of unmet need right now. Fortunately, rux is a fairly-effective drug and it's not an incredibly common situation, but when it is, we'd like to be able to bring to those patients a novel treatment.","Obviously, that has the benefit not only if the patient is being able to rescue their response, as Barry put it earlier, but also to be able to extend the treatment duration of ruxolitinib. That doesn't preclude taking a signal there and even considering it into the first-line setting. If you have a meaningful benefit with a doublet, it's, of course, an interesting clinical question as to whether or not an upfront treatment that may be a more idealized treatment approach and that's something that we would certainly pursue as well as a registration path on the second-line setting, should we have an actionable signal.","I'll let Peter comment if he wants to. It doesn't look like he does. So, I'll turn it over to the next question.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","So, the next question, I'll take the first part. Herv\u00e9 will take the second part. But in terms of EPS, we did mention and gave our guidance today. If you take the guidance and run it through your model, you'll see that our non-GAAP basis will be between $225 million and $250 million net income. Obviously, that means that Q3 and Q4 will be slightly higher than the Q2 non-GAAP net income.","We really haven't talked much, Carter, about what EPS would be next year. We'll give guidance on that, but obviously we're still going to make substantial investments in the pipeline next year. So, I wouldn't expect that you're going to see a big amount of growth.","And Herv\u00e9 has some more comments on that.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","No. I just wanted to reiterate the sort of the principles we are following. One is that fast growth of our top line, because that's really what's driving our ability to develop the portfolio to ensure that the corporation will continue to grow fast over the next years ahead of us. And that principle applied to the IDO program where we were investing and planning to invest to create the leadership position there. And we would apply the same thing to the programs coming from our portfolio when we see the opportunity.","So, today, we have a number of Phase 3 studies ongoing, some of them were in the GVHD. We spoke about cholangiocarcinoma. We have a program that we are planning in bladder cancer, obviously with the FGF. We have a number of programs at that stage of development and as the portfolio is maturing, if we see opportunity, we will certainly invest in them to make sure that we realize the potential for this project.","So, that's sort of the driver. At the end of the day, over a long period of time, the goal is to have multiple growth driver for the top line and to be able to be in a position where we would be profitable in a sustainable way and that's really a direction that we will be following in a window of two to three years.","Carter Gould - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for all the color.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Marc Frahm from Cowen & Company. Your line is now live.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Hi, yes. Thanks for taking my questions. First on the FGFR, just the data expectations moving forward, in the past, you've mentioned a 20% kind of hurdle that the FDA wants to see in response rate with reasonable durability in cholangio. Can you talk about what you think the FDA wants in bladder cancer to see?","And then, kind of related to that, how big of a differential do you think is acceptable \u2013 is not necessarily differentiated versus \u2013 or to say either on the downside that you guys are still close enough to compete or on the upside that you're not a meaningful difference between the two of you?","Peter Langmuir - Incyte Corp.","Hi. Good morning. This is Peter Langmuir again. I think for bladder cancer, we don't have a clear hurdle that we need to be at. Obviously, erdafitinib has showed data so far around 40% response rate. So, we'd like, with our continuous dosing, to get up to that range. I think, clearly, there's the potential we may be differentiated on our safety profile. So, potentially there could be differentiation there if the response rates are similar, but we can show a better safety profile, but obviously, we'll have to wait for the data to come out with that. So, we should have data from that continuous dosing schedule by next year.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, maybe for Barry on pemigatinib, just can you talk about the kind of sales infrastructure, your thoughts are there, what you're going to need for cholangio and maybe if any of that process has started yet, where things stand?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Well, that's a good question. We have 125 sales reps in the field now. Many of the customers they call on currently treat both hematologic malignancies and solid tumors. So, we actually think we have a sales force in place that could actually handle cholangiocarcinoma, a relatively small patient population.","But we do have plans to increase both on our medical affairs side and maybe on the commercial side our understanding of the diagnostic market, so that we know exactly how to communicate to the healthcare professionals that are taking care of these cholangiocarcinoma patients of what testing they need to do and how to get that done quickly.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, one last one for you, Barry. As you've started to do this market research in acute GVHD, in our checks, we've heard about a fair amount of off-label use in this refractory setting. So, I mean do you see much of a immediate growth opportunity or is this really laying the groundwork for the earlier lines of therapy that will come ultimately with the other REACH studies and the GRAVITAS studies reading out?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","There is spontaneous use in both acute and chronic GVHD of Jakafi today, but we do think that with the approval and with any barriers removed from payers, there is a significant opportunity in even the steroid-refractory patient population.","Marc Frahm - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Peter Lawson from SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Peter Lawson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. David, just you had a nice beat on Jakafi this quarter. Anything in that beat over second half around pricing, volume, competition that kind of held you back from raising guidance?","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Well, so the top end of our guidance is $80 million more than what we sold in the first half. So, we had $660 million in the first half and if we get towards the top-end of our guidance, that's another $80 million. That's 12% growth. We still think that \u2013 half-over-half, we still think that's very nice. So, there's nothing that's holding us back. We just think that's a prudent guidance to remain in place for today.","Peter Lawson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","And how should we think about pricing going forward? So, kind of in this kind of price sensitized world, how should we think about moderate pricing and how should we think about growth as it (49:34) moves in to other indications?","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","We think that we've been prudent in our pricing in the past and moving forward, we will continue to do that. Jakafi is in the same price range as other oral cancer drugs that provides the benefit to patients that we believe Jakafi provides to patients and in fact, we're actually below the median or average price of oral cancer drugs.","So, we think the innovation, the fact that we're the only drug approved for myelofibrosis, the only drug approved for polycythemia vera and potentially the first drug approved in acute steroid-refractory graft-versus-host disease and hopefully the first drugs approved in other areas of graft-versus-host disease that our price currently represents the value that Jakafi brings to these patients.","Peter Lawson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Great. Thanks. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Matthew Harrison from Morgan Stanley. Your line is now live.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to ask just one on the PI3K program. Can you just talk about, given that all these are monotherapy studies and you've talked about them being potentially registrationable, what's sort of the response rate bar that you need to be able to file these and how are you thinking about that? Thanks.","Peter Langmuir - Incyte Corp.","Hi. Good morning. Peter Langmuir again. So, we don't have a specific hurdle necessarily, because I think a lot of it is also going to be related to the long-term tolerability and ability to sustain responses over a long duration. So, clearly, we're going to look at this in the context of other therapies, but, again, it's an overall risk benefit profile that will be important when we're looking at this compound in monotherapy.","Matthew K. Harrison - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from Tyler Van Buren from Piper Jaffray. Your line is now live.","Tyler M. Van Buren - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. I guess I want to ask a question on fedratinib. Celgene continues to talk about the potential for it to compete in the first-line setting. In the past, you all said that you're quite confident that they're going to stay in ruxo failure. So, just wanted to hear you maybe reiterate your confidence that they won't compete in the first-line setting anytime soon or perhaps asked another way, what would they need to show in the first line in future studies in order to compete in your opinion?","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Thanks, Tyler. This is Reid. I'll start and I'll turn it over to Barry for some additional comments. We know quite a bit from the presented and published data for fedratinib in terms of its overall profile and it is a potent JAK2 inhibitor. I think one of the liabilities that it has shown is in its safety profile and that likely comes from off-target kinase inhibition.","Significant rates of GI toxicity are probably the most prominent for patients and I think that obviously would be a headwind for any drug moving into the first-line setting when you have an established agent without that liability in place for multiple years.","There's also, I think, the possibility for a Wernicke's risk that is, at least to my mind, still not fully characterized, but certainly present in the Phase 3 data set. So, we'll have to see how updated analyses there look. But from a profile standpoint, I don't think it has, in anyway, the safety profile that you would want for a first-line agent to be able to compete effectively with Jakafi.","And I'll let Barry describe more from the commercial perspective, his thoughts around that.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. So, the only thing I could add is we've heard what Celgene has said about submitting their NDA by the end of the year. Maybe they can get a second-line approval and if that is beneficial for patients who, for some reason, no longer are on Jakafi, that would be a good thing. But the safety profile so far, as Reid said, both in the first and second-line setting seems to be problematic.","If they were to, someday, get an approval in the first-line setting in terms of competing in the marketplace, I think that we would be not concerned about that since the safety profile and the efficacy of Jakafi has been proven in tens of thousands of patients around the world.","Tyler M. Van Buren - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thanks for that. And just as a second question, Herv\u00e9, in the release, you mentioned later-stage development portfolio that may accelerate the growth in the near term and there were some exciting data at the Investor Day and we'll continue to see more through the end of the year. But if you look at slide 27, it suggests that some of the larger opportunities and some of these exciting programs won't really launch until 2020 or 2021.","So, I guess, as you think about near-term acceleration of growth, other than the pipeline, is there anything else that maybe investors should keep in mind, perhaps leveraging the ex-U.S. oncology infrastructure? Are there any potential, smaller near-term accretive deals that could be interesting?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yes, absolutely. I mean, as we said, I mean we have a position where we have some cash in the balance sheet. So, we have the optionality business development and as we have done over the past years, we are always looking at the potential opportunities. Now, there is nothing today I can tell you on what's coming up, but we are looking at complementing what we have from our own pipeline if any opportunity looks attractive enough to justify the cost.","Tyler M. Van Buren - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from coming from Ren Benjamin from Raymond James. Your line is now live.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the progress. Maybe one for Barry in GVHD. Can you talk a little bit about any sort of competitive analysis you have regarding the ibrutinib launch in GVHD? And you talked about rightsizing the field force. Can you provide a little bit more color? Are there people that are just designated for these transplant centers or are people splitting their duties? How does that really work?","And switching gears to Reid really quick, when you talk about the FGF program, can you provide a little bit more color, just explanation regarding the selection and cut-off parameters that you're using and what you're learning there? And if I can squeeze one last one, an IP question regarding the current IP for Jakafi and the potential extensions. Thanks, guys.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Okay. So, Ren, I'll start. So, as far as ibrutinib goes in steroid-refractory chronic GVHD, to be honest, any market research that we have or talking to external experts currently who are treating GVHD, they don't have much use for ibrutinib in that setting. So, the uptick doesn't seem to be that strong.","As far as our sales force goes, we have an arrangement where we have 82 territories and then we have another 40 people that overlap those 82 territories. So, essentially, we have 1.5 persons. So, we call one group oncology territory specialists and the other group oncology area specialists. So, the oncology area specialists are going to be concentrating on those top centers that we highlighted during my presentations.","So, they'll be trained more deeply in GVHD and in how Jakafi works to help patients with chronic and acute GVHD. So, anyway, that's how we're handling it. So, they're assigned to these particular centers. And just remember that more than 50% of these docs that are transplanters, we're already familiar with, because they're already treating myelofibrosis in some way.","So, I'll turn it over to Reid.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Got it.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Sure, Ren. So, I'll take your last few questions. In terms of FGFR and patient selection, FGFR can be activated through amplification, through a point mutation or through translocation and all three have shown to be oncogenic in patients. It turns out that in cholangiocarcinoma and bladder cancer, the two areas that we're focusing on, FGFR is activated through mutations and translocations and we can identify those through sequencing. And so, we're using foundation medicine as our platform for identifying those events.","And so, just through deep sequencing, you either have it or you don't. If you have the mutation or translocation that activates the gene, then you're enrolled in the trial. So, that would be akin to any ALK or BRAF inhibitor development and you would expect to see that in a label, of course.","In terms of the IP, as you know, the late 2027 is the earliest exploration for compositional matter for the ruxolitinib patent. The cream could go several years beyond that, perhaps to the early-30s, 2031. And anything else on combinations whether they'd be with delta or other agents and whether they are discrete agents or fixed-dose combinations would all be predicated on what that IP estate \u2013 how that IP estate evolves, but would be anticipated to have the potential to go well beyond that.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. We've reached the end of our question-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Herv\u00e9 for any further closing comments.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thank you. Thank you all for your time today and for your questions. So, we look forward to seeing some of you at the upcoming investor and medical conferences. But, for now, we thank you again for your participation in the call today.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. Mike Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Diego. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's fourth quarter and year end 2016 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com.","Speaking on today's call will be Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, our CEO, who will begin with some comments on both our long-term strategy and our recent business development activities. Herv\u00e9 will then pass to Barry Flannelly, who leads our U.S. organization and he will provide an update on Jakafi sales and provide some detail on U.S. demand growth in MF and PV. Steven Stein, Incyte's Chief Medical Officer, will highlight the depths of our late-stage programs and detail our key expected value drivers for the year. Dave Gryska, our CFO, will summarize fourth quarter and full year results for 2016 as well as provide 2017 guidance, before opening up the call for Q&A for which we'll be joined by Reid Huber, our Chief Scientific Officer.","We'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2017 guidance, the commercialization of our products, and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2016 and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents.","I'd now like to pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for his introductory remarks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. So we had a very productive year at Incyte in 2016 with total revenue growing at 47% year-on-year and during which we expanded our geographic footprint to include Europe and further advanced our clinical portfolio. We also added to our early-stage program in a meaningful way.","To start, I'd like to begin our discussion today by talking about the DNA of Incyte, which is innovation. We believe that innovation and the discovery of new products is where value is created in our industry and Jakafi's growth enables Incyte to make significant investments in our R&D portfolio.","In fact, more than 60% of 2016 Jakafi product revenue was reinvested into R&D during last year. We are in a strong position to drive our broad portfolios through the clinic and beyond and just yesterday, we announced with Lilly that baricitinib has been approved in Europe for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Baricitinib would be marketed as Olumiant and royalties from Olumiant has the potential to be a significant future revenue driver for Incyte.","This next slide shows the evolution of our full year annual revenue since 2012. As you can see, we have had impressive growth since the launch of Jakafi both in the U.S. and ex-U.S. with Novartis and we're pleased to announce today that for the first time ever, total annual revenue recorded by Incyte has surpassed $1 billion.","Next, I'll talk about how we are reinvesting these resources in an effort to sustain and accelerate our future growth.","As you can see on slide 7, we now have seven late-stage programs. Baricitinib and capmatinib are partnered globally with Lilly and Novartis, respectively, and we intend to maintain our current rights for the other five candidates in major market. Steven will provide update on the details of our late-stage plans showing that having this depth of late-stage candidates places us in a very good position for future growth.","Within the early-stage portfolio, we have added our new clinical candidate, INCB62079, which is a selective FGFR4 inhibitor. Last month, we added the first-in-class oral arginase inhibitor, INCB01158, to our portfolio through an alliance agreement with Calithera and in December, we further enhanced our discovery effort through a long-term collaboration with Merus.","I'll discuss this collaboration further in the next slide. I'd begin with our Calithera collaboration. We believe that arginase is an important target within the tumor microenvironment and could have a role in combination with other immuno-oncology therapies, including epacadostat. We are excited to have secured global rights to a first-in-class molecule, which is already in the clinic. INCB01158 has shown an attractive preclinical profile, including potencies, selectivity or bioavailability and in vivo efficacy and safety. It's currently being studied in a monotherapy dose escalation trial and combination trials are planned.","Concerning Merus, our strategic collaboration with Merus is expected to provide us long-term access to their Biclonics Technology for up to 11 programs. We believe Biclonics is the leading bispecific technology for four main reasons. It uses fully human antibodies, it uses a native IgG format, it allows for the functional screening of potential candidates and manufacturing of Biclonics is expected to be relatively simple.","We have just had the initial \u2013 the first Scientific Kickoff Meeting and we very much look forward to working with the Merus team in the coming years.","I'll now pass the call to Barry for the update on Jakafi.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone.","Sales of Jakafi continue to perform well. On the left side of this slide, you see that Jakafi's revenue for the full year 2016 was $853 million, a 42% increase over the full year 2015. In the fourth quarter, net product revenue from Jakafi was $238 million, a 6% increase over Q3 and a 30% increase over the fourth quarter revenue of 2015. In the next slide, we'll provide more detail on the 30% growth we saw from Q4 2015 to Q4 2016.","On slide 11, you can see that growth in Jakafi is substantially driven by patient demand. The bar graph on the left shows that the number of patients on Jakafi at the end of Q4 2016 grew 28% over Q4 2015. In comparison, revenue growth in the same period was 30%.","The bar graph on the right shows how the 28% growth in total patients is split by total and new patients in each indication. Both indications are contributing to growth of the brand and PV growth is greater than MF growth. This is due to the significantly larger established patient base in myelofibrosis, and we expect polycythemia vera to be a major long-term driver of Jakafi growth, due to the larger potential patient population and the potential for longer duration of treatment.","Next, I'd like to talk to you about Jakafi guidance for 2017 and in the longer-term. As we announced about a month ago, we expect long-term peak sales of Jakafi to reach $2 billion. This guidance includes revenue from myelofibrosis and polycythemia vera indications and the potential GVHD indication, but does not yet reflect estimates for the potential approval of Jakafi in essential thrombocythemia.","Today, we announced that our 2017 Jakafi net product revenue guidance is a range of $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion. This reflects what we believe will be continued patient demand growth in both approved indications.","With that, I'll pass the call to Steven for a clinical update.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Barry, and good morning, everyone. We have a broad and deep portfolio, here at Incyte. We have multiple late-stage assets that are in or are expected to begin pivotal trials this year. I'll provide more details on slide 15, the next slide .","The pivotal program of ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory graft versus host disease is underway and the pivotal programs that we expect to begin this year include those of ruxolitinib in essential thrombocythemia and itacitinib in treatment-na\u00efve graft versus host disease.","In addition to the ongoing Phase 3 trial of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab in Melanoma, we expect to begin pivotal trials of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer, bladder cancer, renal cancer and head and neck cancer during 2017.","We are also currently running three Phase 2 trials, that if successful, may be registration-enabling. The FGFR1\/2\/3 inhibitor, INCB54828 in patients with bladder cancer, cholangiocarcinoma and an 8p11 translocated myeloproliferative neoplasm. A fourth Phase 2 trial that may also be registration-enabling is with our PI3 kinase Delta inhibitor, INCB50465 in patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma. This trial is expected to begin in the first half of 2017.","In addition, we have two late-stage assets, the JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor, baricitinib, and the c-MET inhibitor, capmatinib, which are partnered with Eli Lilly and Novartis, respectively. Baricitinib is now approved in Europe and other global regulatory reviews for rheumatoid arthritis are ongoing.","Lilly announced that it plans to begin a Phase 3 trial of baricitinib in patients with psoriatic arthritis during 2017. We have opted into co-development for this indication as well as for co-development of axial spondyloarthritis and atopic dermatitis, should Lilly also progress these indications into pivotal development.","Novartis expects data from the trial of capmatinib in combination with EGFR inhibition in patients with non-small cell lung cancer to readout later in 2017, and also expects to submit an NDA to the FDA for capmatinib in non-small cell lung cancer in 2018.","Next, I'd like to move to our epacadostat program. As we announced with Merck last month, we have decided to expand the combination of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab into four additional tumor types, and we expect to begin these pivotal programs during 2017. Of the nine total tumor types studied in ECHO-202, five are now in or being moved into pivotal development. We continue to collect data for the diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and microsatellite instability-high colorectal cancer cohorts, and have no current plans to move ahead with either ovarian cancer or triple-negative breast cancer.","Slide 17 shows our current portfolio. Over the course of 2016, our portfolio has evolved significantly, and is now nicely balanced between early-stage versus late-stage assets. Since our call this time last year, we've added five new clinical candidates and have moved more than half of that existing portfolio into the next stage of development.","We believe that our portfolio is unique and unparalleled for a company of our size and contains both first-in-class and best-in-class candidates. We intend to pursue development of our product candidates in both mono and combinatorial settings further enhancing the optionality of our opportunities.","The agreements of Merus and Calithera are both additive to and potentially synergistic with our in-house discovery and development efforts. And the agreement we have reached with Agenus to restructure our collaboration gives Incyte control of the global development and commercialization of our two lead large molecule therapeutics.","I'll now finish my section on our expected news flow.","On slide 18, you can see the progress we expect to make in our portfolio over the next year. Much of this has already been communicated with our previous slides. So, I'd like to highlight just a few things. First, we are preparing to present first-in-man data for INCB54828, our FGFR1\/2\/3 inhibitor, during the first half of 2017, with the data from the BRD and PIM programs potentially later in the year.","We plan to begin the new pivotal programs of epacadostat in non-small cell lung cancer, renal cancer, bladder cancer and head and neck cancer during 2017. And we also expect to initiate a proof-of-concept trial of topical ruxolitinib in patients with vitiligo. We expect 2017 to be a busy year at Incyte and we look forward to keeping you updated on our progress.","With that, I'll pass the call to Dave for the financials.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Steven, and good morning, everyone. I'd like to start by discussing our fourth quarter and 2016 performance and then provide guidance for 2017, which will include the accounting for Agenus, Merus and Calithera agreements.","In the fourth quarter, we recorded $326 million in total revenue. This was comprised of $238 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $13 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $33 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis and $43 million in contract revenue, including a milestone paid to us by Novartis, related to pricing approval of Jakavi for PV.","For 2016, we recorded $1.1 billion of total revenue. This was comprised of $853 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $30 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $111 million in Jakavi royalties from Novartis and $113 million in contract revenue.","Our gross to net adjustment for Jakafi for 2016 was approximately 12%. Our cost of product revenue for the quarter and full year was $20 million and $58 million, respectively. This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis for U.S. Jakafi net sales and the amortization of acquired product rights related to the Iclusig product acquisition.","Our R&D expense for the quarter was $162 million, including $17 million in non-cash stock compensation. For the full year, our R&D expense was $582 million, including $60 million in non-cash stock compensation.","Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $96 million, including $10 million in non-cash stock compensation. For the full year, our SG&A expense was $303 million, including $36 million in non-cash stock compensation.","We recorded $7 million in expense related to the change in the fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability in the fourth quarter and $17 million for the full year.","As for net income for the quarter and full year, we reported $9 million and $104 million, respectively. Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the fourth quarter with $809 million in cash and marketable securities.","To summarize, we are extremely pleased with our performance in 2016. Jakafi delivered strong revenue growth. We grew our cash position by over $100 million for the year and continue to make significant advancements in our clinical development programs.","Turning to slide 21, I would like to highlight some key drivers of our 2017 guidance. We anticipate that milestone payments may add significantly to Incyte's total revenue during 2017. The events which may trigger these milestones are laid out on the left hand side of slide 21. We announced that yesterday of the European approval of baricitinib, which will be marketed as Olumiant is the first of what we expect will be several global approvals of baricitinib. In addition, Lilly moving baricitinib into Phase 3 in new indications would also trigger milestone payments to Incyte.","We also anticipate that development and commercialization milestones on Jakavi may be triggered by Novartis. On the expense side, we anticipate epacadostat and baricitinib to be drivers of ongoing R&D expense, and the recently signed agreements with Agenus, Merus and Calithera will add one-time items to our R&D expense in 2017.","In terms of SG&A expense, 2017 will be the first full year that we include our European operations. Moving on, I'll now summarize the key components of our 2017 guidance. Please note, that the guidance we provide today does not include any additional potential future strategic transactions beyond the Merus and Calithera collaborations already announced.","For 2017, we expect net product revenue from Jakafi to be in the range of $1.02 billion to $1.07 billion. For Iclusig, we expect net product revenue to be in the range of $60 million to $65 million. And as I detailed on the previous slide, we expect to receive up to $300 million in milestone payments from our collaboration partners. The most significant portion of the $300 million milestone payments will be $165 million in milestone payments from Lilly for baricitinib approvals in the U.S. and Europe.","We anticipate receiving royalties from Lilly after the approval of Olumiant, and will continue to receive royalty payments from Novartis on Jakavi in 2017. We are not providing guidance on these royalties. We expect our gross to net adjustment for 2017 to be approximately 13% for Jakafi. Jakafi is the main driver of our gross to net adjustment and as with similar oncology drugs, our gross to net adjustment is higher in the first quarter than the rest of the year, primarily because of our share of a donut hole from Medicare Part D patients.","We expect total cost of goods sold to be in the range of $75 million to $80 million. This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties to Novartis on U.S. Jakafi net sales and the amortization of acquired product rights, related to the Iclusig product acquisition. 2017 R&D expense guidance is made up of two parts; one-time expenses associated with Agenus, Merus and Calithera collaborations, and ongoing expense associated with development of our extensive product pipeline.","The Merus collaboration consisted of $120 million upfront cash payment and an $80 million stock investment. We will recognize the $120 million payment along with approximately a $2 million premium on the stock purchase as R&D expense in the first quarter.","The Calithera collaboration agreement consisted of a $45 million upfront cash payment and an $8 million stock investment. We will recognize the $45 million payment along with an approximate $4 million discount on the stock purchase as R&D expense in the first quarter. This will result in $41 million of R&D expense in the first quarter for this particular collaboration.","The amendment on the Agenus agreement consists of $20 million in accelerated milestone payments and a $60 million (21:21) stock investment. We'll recognize the $20 million payment along with approximately $20 million premium on the stock purchase as R&D expense in the first quarter. We therefore expect these one-time expense items to be approximately $205 million and we expect ongoing R&D expense to be in the range of $785 million to $835 million, including non-cash expense related to employee equity awards. The increase in our ongoing R&D expense year-over-year is mainly driven by the advancement of our products in the pipeline, including the previously announced plans to move into multiple Phase 3 studies of epacadostat and an opt-in to co-fund additional indications for baricitinib with Lilly.","We expect SG&A expense to be in the range of $340 million to $360 million, including non-cash expense related to employee equity awards. As I mentioned earlier, the increase in our SG&A expense year-over-year includes a full year of expense for our recently acquired European operations versus seven months in 2016. We expect total non-cash expense related to employee equity awards to be in the range of $130 million to $140 million.","In addition, we expect a change in the fair market value of a contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability to be in the range of $30 million to $35 million. And finally, we expect net income to be in the range of $50 million to $70 million. I would note however that the inherent uncertainty with respect to achievement and timing of milestones I detailed earlier may create variability in our net income on a quarterly basis.","I'll finish on slide 23, which provides a summary of our clinical and strategic goals. Incyte is very well-positioned from a cash and operating income perspective to execute on our strategies for growth, which we are confident will deliver significant long-term shareholder value in 2017 and beyond. Incyte has a broad portfolio of late-stage assets, which have the potential to drive significant momentum and value over the next several years. We also have plans for further geographic expansion into the Asia Pacific region to enable us to maximize the potential of our product portfolio.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open up the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Please state your question.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys, thanks very much for taking my question and congrats on all the progress. I guess on epacadostat, I was wondering if you could maybe talk to some of the considerations in designing a Phase 3 for epacadostat plus pembro in non-small cell lung. Any learnings from the biomarker data and evolving clinical results that might shape the trial design or patient selection for lung or other indications?","And then, I'm curious if you've yet established economic terms around the future Phase 3 trial conduct with Merck? Is there any consideration to an exclusivity arrangement akin to melanoma? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Brian, hi. It's Steven Stein. Thank you for your question. I'll do the first part and Herv\u00e9 will address your second part of your question. I can't give you any granular details. They're still being worked out. The data that enabled the decision has been submitted to a major meeting and the abstracts for that meeting will be released in middle of May and until then we bound by the rules, embargo rules related to that. But we do take into consideration in any histology all of the above that you mentioned; response, duration of response and the biomarker piece. Just to end on the lung one, because that's the one you highlighted, obviously that's an area that is moving quickly, both in the first-line, second-line setting, PD-L1-positive, PD-L1-negative and has numerous report-outs this year as well.","So, it's an area, we'll be obviously paying very, very careful attention to, in terms of the study design and that will be shared with you on ClinicalTrials.gov when it goes live. In terms of the terms, I will let Herv\u00e9 speak to it.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Like Steven said, I mean the work today, most of the work today that is ongoing is related to the design of the study and the way we're going to organize the teams to manage the studies at the same time in parallel, we are discussing with Merck on the term and the economics. I mean the basic assumption is that, we have drugs that will be provided by each of the company to contribute to the study.","Then one of the company would be leading the execution of the study for some of them, there would be cost sharing for all of them. We don't know yet exactly how that would be done for the pembro program and we have no further information of discussion related to exclusivity. So that's really where we're and it's ongoing, and we expect that to be running in parallel with the clinical work and sort of coming to conclusion over the next few weeks as a target.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kennen Mackay with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Kennen Mackay - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thanks so much. Maybe one for Barry, just on the guidance. I was just wondering if the Jakafi guidance included any pricing increase assumptions and maybe just sort of in line with what we've seen in terms of sort of a timing of historical price increases or if this was purely based on volume growth? Thank you.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Well, most of it's based on volume growth. We don't really talk about price increases at all. Going forward, we might assume modest price increases. But, as you can see from the slides for 2016, we have nice uptake in total patients and new patients both for MF and PV.","Kennen Mackay - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And then again maybe just a follow-up for Barry. Is there anything you can \u2013 any sort of color you can provide on the sort of duration of treatment we're seeing in polycythemia vera versus in myelofibrosis?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","What we said is that it's longer. Getting an accurate reading on persistency for an oral drug over time is not that easy. But PV has been longer than MF, but even our MF patients, we have many of them that have been on for five years or more. But when you look at a 12-month cohort of patients, PV patients are longer than MF patients.","Kennen Mackay - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks so much for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first question is for Mike. My team loves your music selection. How do you choose those?","Michael Charles A. Booth - Incyte Corp.","I'm pleased you like it. Next question, please.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I have a serious question here. So for Steve, on slide 18, it seems that you've put the timing for initiation of additional pivotal trial for epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab towards the end of this year. I was wondering what is the gating factor here since you already have the data from Phase 2 in-house?","And then secondly, also you guys are starting to recruit for the Phase 3 for ET. Can you tell us about the addressable size for ET?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yes, hi, it's Steven Stein. Thanks for your questions, Ying. In terms of, you know we said 2017, because it's hard to give precision in terms of you know exactly when a first patient will be enrolled. The things that go into are, obviously, the standard stuff in terms of writing a protocol. But the real critical path is getting the regulatory meetings done and the regulatory feedback and get an agreement on the design and the endpoints. And I would say, in answer to your question at a high level, that's the critical piece. The plan though is very much to get, hopefully, every one of the Phase 3s started in 2017, but a lot will depend on the regulatory feedback.","Your second question related to ruxolitinib in essential thrombocythemia, you know it's an indication we've been interested in obviously for a while, given that it is one of the myeloproliferative neoplasms. There is a Phase 2 dataset that was presented and published by Incyte in 2014 in 39 patients, looking at various aspects, but including endpoints in terms of control of platelet count, white blood cell count, and in a few patients that had splenomegaly, in fact four of them, three of them got resolution of that splenomegaly.","So, we know we have activity in terms of the endpoints of interest. Only thing we've guided to is to start the study in 2017 and nothing further at this moment.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I have two of them for you as well. First of all, was the Agenus amendment driven by any new or additional data you've seen on the GITR or OX40 programs?","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yes. Hi, Cory, this is Reid. Thanks for the question. No. Really the Agenus amendment is one that is really designed to, as Steven said, give Incyte the control of the global development and commercialization of those two programs, which had previously been structured as a 50%\/50%. We think that's going to significantly simplify the decision-making process and really increase the flexibility around the conduct of the current trials, as well as help speed the initiation of any new clinical trials. That's nothing to do with any emerging data with respect to those two programs.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And then the second question I have is, I'm curious about the difference between ruxolitinib and INCB39110, or I guess itacitinib I think it's called now, in treating GVHD. Curious why one is specifically geared towards steroid refractory patients and the other targeting treatment-na\u00efve patients? Is there something in particular about the two molecules that leads you in this direction? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","So, Cory, I will start off and Reid may want to add something about the biology. But INCB39110, which is now called itacitinib, is, if you take rux as your reference for JAK1\/JAK2 and use a 1:1 ratio there, then INCB39110, it's itacitinib now, is about 20-fold more selective for JAK1. So, there was always a feeling, at least theoretically, that because of its potential to be more sparing, in terms of cell counts, that it may have a different utility in certain settings. If you look at our dataset from our proof-of-concept study that we presented at the American Society of Hematology at the end of 2016, you will see that in fact, in the steroid-na\u00efve acute setting, itacitinib had an 83% response rate. In the latter (33:21) steroid-refractory chronic setting, it was 63%, and so we feel that data is supportive of doing steroid-na\u00efve acute development, which is where we're heading with the compound, which is an area by the way where you may want to be more sparing given that people have just received transplants and may have more trouble in terms of cytopenias. So, that's what I'll say about why we headed that way.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking my question. So, firstly, with regard to on the 2016 results, we see about 28% growth in patients on drug, but only 30% revenue growth. So does this mean that you're netting 2% of price increases?","And then on the SG&A expense side, your 4Q run rate is about $24 million above the top end of your 2017 guidance. So were there any one-time items in 4Q that should not recur in 2017 or what does this trend suggest?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Salveen, it's Barry. Just to clarify, I'll take the first part of your question and then I guess, Dave will take the next part of your question. First of all, it's 42% net sales growth full year 2016 over 2015. And then, what you're referring to as 28% is just new patient growth on Jakafi and it doesn't necessarily correlate directly with net product revenue because patients get fewer or greater number of bottles in a given quarter as they come on. And then you have the effect of inventory and burning off of inventory from one quarter to the next quarter.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Salveen, it's Dave. I'll take your second question on the SG&A expense. The reason it's slightly higher in Q4 is just the artifact of timing between Q3 and Q4. So that was just a timing issue and on a go-forward basis, if you look into 2017, we wouldn't expect to see that kind of a difference between Q3 and Q4.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And then just on the pipeline, you've previously suggested that your Phase 3 go-forward decisions with Merck were in part due to the Phase 2 starting first. So, when should we expect data from the other three partnerships to be sufficient, decide on next steps? And then essential thrombocytopenia, I think in the past, you opted not to move forward with this program, so what's changed on this front?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Salveen, hi, it's Steven. In terms of the collaboration, you're absolutely right. It's an effective timing. So, the Merck collaboration with IDO, the ECHO-202 program, was first to begin and that's why that dataset matured first. The other datasets across the other collaborations are as we've always said, maturing as we speak, so over the next weeks and months. Those, who will come in, we'll be looking at them and making further decisions there. So, you're right, it's just an operational timing issue, but those are coming in.","Essential thrombocythemia, it was around what to do in terms of the endpoint. So, the first-line treatment is commonly hydroxyurea. There is an FDA-approved drug for second-line treatment, anagrelide, which can lower platelet counts. The dataset that I quoted earlier with ruxolitinib in essential thrombocythemia patients, shows that we can both lower platelets, lower white blood cell counts and resolve splenomegaly when it's present.","So, the ability to use those as a regulatory endpoint in a setting that's post-hydroxyurea is where we're interested now. And it was just an evolution in terms of the understanding of our own dataset and the opportunity with regulators to design the correct study.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Please state your question.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Maybe just wanted to get a couple of clarifications. So, on the decision to move forward with the IDO\/pembro combo in the four different tumor types, just wanted to clarify that doesn't limit it to four Phase 3 studies, that you could run multiple studies, multiple Phase 3 trials in a given tumor type?","And separately, just wanted to ask if a decision to evaluate pembro\/IDO chemo combo, would that need to be preceded by Phase 1, Phase 2 data or do you feel like you've learned enough to maybe sort of \u2013 maybe a little bit of leap of faith, but move that into pivotal trials as well?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Ian, hi. It's Steven. Thank you. So, you are absolutely correct. In terms of the histology, they stand on their own. But there are opportunities to do different settings. So for example, a first-line setting, a second-line setting, and then as you alluded to, in the second part of your question, with or without chemotherapy combinations. And then the nuances for example in some cancers, people can't receive chemotherapy first-line for various reasons, either age or intolerability.","So, you are absolutely correct. This is not limited to a finite number of Phase 3 studies in any histology. In terms of chemotherapy combinations, it's safety that needs to enable it, as you alluded to. We do have and are about to open studies looking at combinations of the triplets, PD-1 and IDO1 inhibitor plus chemotherapy, but there is also the opportunity to potentially do safety run-ins within either Phase 2 or Phase 3 studies that will satisfy either regulatory requirements or IRB requirements to get the safety data you need to enable the chemotherapy combination. And we will explore both in terms of the most efficient way to get the data we need and then obviously safety first and making sure these combinations are safe.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Should we assume then that the potential chemo combos would start a little bit later, so they potentially might not be in 2017. And then, just a separate question, if I just can ask, on baricitinib, I thought the opt-in decisions were contingent on Phase 2 data. So have you seen the atopic dermatitis Phase 2 data for baricitinib already?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","So, just to again your first question and it's Steven again, Ian. I don't think it's gated particularly to time, because you can start the Phase 3 with the safety run-in and the required number of patients may not be large. So, you could end up doing 10 patients' to 20 patients' worth of data and not incur a tremendous time hit. So, I don't feel that the case would mean any substantial delay. The opt-in decisions are something we work carefully with, obviously, with Eli Lilly. The one that is absolutely going forward currently is the psoriatic arthritis one. We have communicated that we were opting in to atopic dermatitis and then axial spondyloarthritis, but we've yet to go through in detail those data packages with Lilly.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please state your question.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Morning, guys, and thanks for the question. I had a few quick ones for Reid, and then a follow-up. Just want to get some perspective on epacadostat in breast or ovarian cancer. Should we interpret your Phase 3 as evidence that IDO value is more correlated to PD-L1, PD-1 access? And what does the science tell you about whether other mechanisms like arginase synthesis can turn cold tumors hot?","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yes, Geoff, this is Reid. Thanks for the question. I think we're obviously learning in real-time with epacadostat as the data from the ECHO program comes in. But as you alluded to the fact that we have go-forward decisions now and data to support those in myeloma, renal cell, head and neck, lung and bladder, those would all be classified as the inflamed tumor types. Those with a resident T-cell population and ones which are generally responsive even to single-agent PD-1.","The lack of activity thus far in triple-negative breast and ovarian cancer would be consistent again with IDO being active there. Love to see how the data comes in for the other tumor types, but that's certainly where we're leaning and what the data supports. In terms of arginase, completely different mechanism targeting the myeloid cell population, could be subject to very different rules in terms of which patients are more likely to respond, and that's something that will be studied very carefully in the Phase 1, Phase 2 development program for INCB01158.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then bigger picture question for Herv\u00e9 or Dave. So, when I look at your guys' pipeline, obviously a lot going on in oncology with partnered and wholly-owned programs. I guess the question is how do you think about capacity constraints, either, say, capital or personnel as more and more programs move from proof-of-concept to Phase 3? Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Herv\u00e9 here. I can start. And maybe in terms of capital, we are really managing the P&L in a way where we are careful that we are allocating resources to the program that we believe are the most promising. So, that's the first discipline and it's really applied to every program that we have. You can see from the numbers, that we are cash flow-positive. We have a cash position at the end of Q4 that was around $800 million. So, we are in a position where we can do in parallel epacadostat Phase 3 and as we discussed, some of this Phase 3 will be, could be co-funded by some of the partners we're working with and at the same time, the baricitinib opt-in, which is financially relatively significant, but we believe is an excellent, excellent investment for the corporation. The rest of the portfolio assuming some of these products are going to move forward into later stage and Phase 3 studies would be at this stage that from the capital standpoint we can afford that.","From the personnel standpoint, obviously the baricitinib programs are \u2013 we are not dedicating any head count to this program, they are all conducted by Lilly. As we discussed with epacadostat, some of these programs hopefully will be done with a partner involved, which could also help from that standpoint. And for the rest, we have become over the past few years, a company that is attracting some of the top talent in the industry.","We are increasing our capabilities in clinical research across Europe, thanks to the acquisition of the ARIAD Europe team. We have a medical team in place on top of the existing medical team we were building in Geneva over the past few years. And in the U.S., we have a team now that is fully fledged and is really operating at capacity. There is no (44:46) situation yet as we are growing in parallel with the portfolio.","Obviously in Japan, we've not yet established our own team there. It's something that I would like to do over the next few months in a progressive way, nothing crazy. But where we will have the opportunity to do our own clinical development, regulatory pharmacogenomic (45:10) activities in Japan and that from the financial standpoint will be, in fact, cost saving versus using CROs.","So, it's something that we'll be sort of replacing internal capabilities versus external CROs. So, overall, we are managing the cash flow, that's really important. And we are looking at how to grow the teams as we need through the portfolio evolving and frankly the past two years have shown that it can be done in parallel in a way that's pretty effective. So, that's where we are. It was a long answer, but it's a very important subject for me.","Geoffrey C. Meacham - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yes. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tony Butler with Guggenheim Securities. Please state your question.","Tony Butler, Ph.D. - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Yes. Good morning and thank you. A couple of questions. One for Reid. You made a comment about the Agenus agreement and it not changing based on OX40 or GITR, but I noticed an abstract at the AACR, which seems to be quite interesting utilizing epacadostat plus OX40 and GITR, suggesting that OX40 GITR potentiate epacadostat. So, I am curious if you might want to, or if you can spend a minute just discussing that. Does it require both and therefore not either to potentiate epacadostat?","And then a question around the paired biopsies. Do you actually have data and a biopsy post-dose that illustrates clonal T-cell to the tumor? Can you actually comment around that? And finally, can you give us the average dose of MF and PV currently? Thanks very much.","Reid M. Huber - Incyte Corp.","Yes, hi, Tony. This is Reid. I'll take your first two questions and then I'll turn it over to Barry. In terms of the AACR abstract, obviously, we'll have to wait till those data are presented to discuss them in more detail, but suffice it to say that as two co-stimulatory receptors that can have activity at the level of a T-cell, it's an interesting scientific concept to be able to use OX40 and GITR agonism in concert with checkpoint blockade, such as PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitions, or with IDO1 inhibition, and so that's been an area of active research that we've had over the past year and we're excited to be able to share those data.","In terms of the other question, on paired biopsies, this is an active effort of research in our Translational Sciences and Steven's Clinical Group. We now have trials ongoing that we call platform trials, where the PD-1 antagonist is dosed with JAK1 or with PI3 kinase Delta inhibition and similarly all-oral doublets on the backbone of JAK1 inhibition to study exactly what you alluded to which were paired biopsies where the on-treatment biopsy is really designed to tell us, how we may be affecting the quality and the quantity of the immune cell infiltrate. So, these are clinical studies and translational studies that are ongoing as we speak.","Barry?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","So, Tony, I think you asked the average dose in MF and PV. So, for the entire brand, the average dose is 10 milligrams, the average bottles that we shipped is 10 milligrams. It's about 60% of the bottles shipped. That's mostly because of PV. MF patients on average, it's more than 10 milligrams b.i.d., but for the brand it's 10 milligrams b.i.d.","Tony Butler, Ph.D. - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company. Please state your question.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Couple of big picture questions maybe for Herv\u00e9. Could you characterize Bristol, AstraZeneca and Roche's current interest in moving forward with epacadostat? I think in the past you've said that Roche might be a little less interested than the others. And then I've noticed you've got a lot more going on in dermatology, both topical and systemic than you have in the past. Is Incyte ready to kind of commit to dermatology as a new focus indication of interest? Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Okay. No, I think as we said, I mean the sequence of available data is different for each of the partners. So, if you assume that the availability of data is raising their excitement about the potential of the combination, it's also coming with time and depending on when the data is available. So, I would not characterize any of the interest as being different. It's true that with Genentech Roche, we started a little bit later with (50:01) programs. So that's the only thing I would say related to that. But there is certainly a lot of interest as you know in the target and in \u2013 certainly also in working with us for some of these programs.","Regarding dermatology, I must say there is no strategic great vision about moving Incyte into dermatology as we have said multiple time, we are \u2013 the products are leading us in different therapeutic areas. It's not really us trying to drive them into one place or another. It's just happened that obviously with the JAK inhibition, we have a number of indication in dermatology. So, Lilly programs will be done independently by Lilly and we are not involved more than the co-funding that we discussed and the ability to receive royalties or milestone.","On the topical side, we have decided now, it was a little bit more than a year ago, to go through the program, the Phase 2 program to establish the right dose and find where it works, where it doesn't work. There are number of indication now where we are doing some level of Phase 2 studies, and obviously we will see after that where we go with that, there is no decision that has been made yet.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please state your question.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. I was wondering if you could just expand a little bit more on the opportunity for Jakafi in ET. So you'd be looking, it sounds like post-hydroxyurea, could you maybe quantify that patient population a little bit better and where you \u2013 just trying to understand the opportunity?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yes, hi, Liisa. It's Steven Stein. So, you're correct that the study is most likely to be in a post-hydroxyurea setting, and with the endpoints I discussed. What we do know at a very high level is that it's smaller than an MF and PV in terms of the opportunity. Beyond that, it's hard to say anything more at this stage to you in terms of its size.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then for capmatinib, can you please remind us of the economics that surround that for yourselves? I noticed that, that will be reporting out Phase 3 data this year.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yes. So, capmatinib is licensed to \u2013 Herv\u00e9 here, is licensed to Novartis. So it basically is a very traditional the kind of deed where there are milestones, which I don't think we have disclosed precisely and the royalties. And the royalties have been disclosed and they are 12% to 14% depending on the cumulative sets per year (53:08).","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with SunTrust. Please state your question. Mr. Lawson, your line is open.","Peter Lawson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Question for David or Barry, just around any timing issues or inventory burn or stocking we should think about for Jakafi for 1Q. And anything around, any color around the milestones for 2017 around the timing, if that's kind of back-half loaded?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Peter, Barry. Just try to understanding your question, so inventory in Q1, our inventory has been relatively consistent between 2.8 weeks and 3 weeks of inventory. I don't see any change in Q1 for inventory, but of course we do know that the gross to net is impacted by our ability for all-oral oncology drugs because of closing the donut hole, but inventory is not going to affect that.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Hi. It's Dave. I'll try to attempt to answer the question on the milestones. We announced today that obviously with the approval of baricitinib in Europe, we will get a $65 million milestone that will come through in Q1. And Lilly has stated on the U.S. approval, one should look to that in terms of the Q2 timeframe. So, it's safe to say that there will be at least a goodly amount of milestones in Q2, but Q1 there is just one so far, as a result of that plus it would be additional programs we talked about collaborations between Agenus, Merus and Calithera there will be a loss in Q1, because there won't be enough milestones to offset those one-time R&D costs. And after that in Q2, there'll be another substantial milestone and then some smaller ones that carry in Q3 and Q4.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ren Benjamin with Raymond James. Please state your question.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on the quarter. Maybe the first question, can you give us any color or an update to the PD-1 inhibitor program and how you're thinking about that going forward and what the profile is that you've assessed so far.","And then the second question is just pertaining around baricitinib. Do you have any color regarding what the additional data that might've been submitted by Lilly to the FDA? And just kind of in a bigger picture sort of question, not focusing in on royalties per se, but thinking about your internal expectations for kind of the growth ramp and how you're viewing sales coming in for baricitinib?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Hi, Ren. It's Steven Stein. I'll address your first question and a little bit of your second, but Herv\u00e9 will take the backend piece. In terms of our PD-1 program in the INCSHR1210 compound, we are this quarter looking through the data we gathered through dose escalation, last year and completed and trying to understand the product's profile in terms of its PK et cetera. We'll point you towards the meeting we submit an abstract to and when we present it for any further detail on that. But we're in the midst of doing that exercise right now. In terms of the baricitinib negotiations with Food and Drug Administrations and what's going on, I'll just have to refer you to Lilly on that.","But Lilly did say in their public remarks that they expect to get to a good point with the FDA sometime soon and I'll leave it at that.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Now, regarding the economics of baricitinib obviously for us, it's very important because \u2013 so there is a milestone, which we expect in fact and what we described today, we expect that to reach us this year. And then there are royalties in the 20% to 29% tranche that will be coming over the next 10-plus years. So, it's going to 2030 for the first patent expiration. So we look at it as a product that can become very significant for us over the years. We are very happy to see really moving into a number of new indications, where obviously and that's why we are also opting-in for these programs, because it will obviously grow the top line potential and therefore the royalty potential for this product over the years.","In terms of calibration in each of these indications, frankly, we need to see the guidance from Lilly and I would not comment more than what they have said about the fact that it's a very promising and very important product for patients with rheumatoid arthritis.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Maybe just, Herv\u00e9, if you don't mind a quick follow-up.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yes.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","How do you guys think about the Pfizer drug already being out there, or a run rate established of about $1 billion and a quick second-to-market JAK inhibitor coming in? How are you guys thinking about that potential?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","So, the way we look at it is we look at the U.S. and that's what you're describing and then we look at the rest of the world and they are fairly different situations there. In fact the markets, if you think of it that way, for these type of products, are not very homogenous worldwide, so you have to take that into account. If you look at the profile of the product, what we think is that in the JAK1\/JAK2 category, baricitinib is fairly unique, (59:21) different profile, including the JAK3. We also see in the U.S. that there is a (59:30) situation that is totally unique in the world and it has a huge impact on the way these patients are treated.","So, all of that can lead to the right position for baricitinib. There will be fairly significant changes in this market over the next years with availability of different types of products on top of the existing ones. So I really think there is a huge opportunity. The clinical profile that came out of the Phase 3 studies was really better than expected from a lot of standpoint, and we are \u2013 I mean, I am personally very confident that there is lot of room to make it a big success.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","All right. Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","But don't think that the U.S. picture is the same everywhere in the world. In fact you see very different types of who is the market leader by country, and the potential (60:24) U.S. on top of the U.S. potential is certainly important or so for baricitinib.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James Financial, Inc.","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, we have now reached our hour duration for this call. But we do have time for one more question. And that last question will come from Michael Schmidt with Leerink. Please state your question.","Michael Schmidt, Ph.D. - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Good morning and thanks for squeezing me in. I guess one bigger picture question. You've been obviously very active in terms of augmenting your pipeline and discovery capabilities in the first quarter here with some VD and licensing (61:01) agreements. What role do you expect VD (61:05) to play going forward, in particular, if you think about building out operations in Asia? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Okay, Herv\u00e9 here. So, I think, our priorities are our own internal discovery programs. So that's something that is a core of what we do at Incyte. So we are not in a mode of sort of changing that in a way that would be dilutive in any way. And we have protected the team very much in a way we have the partnership we did, where in technologies that we are different. So that was Agenus and Merus antibodies that where we didn't have the internal capabilities. And what we plan is to continue to rely on our internal discovery capabilities and just complement them in the technologies, where we're not present.","Concerning Asia, frankly, when I look back at 2016 and we can see a number of things that were very successful, including the approval of baricitinib just yesterday, which is the second product from Incyte being approved after ruxolitinib. So it tells you something about our discovery capabilities. But when I look back, there is one thing that has been also very successful is the expansion in Europe through the acquisition of the ARIAD team and it was done in a very economically reasonable way for us. So we would love to have a similar situation in Asia.","We have not found it yet. So what we're doing now is starting the planning again in a careful way, where we would be establishing a team in Japan to start with, to take care of the pipeline, the late-stage pipeline and make sure that we are putting that on a ramp to approval in Japan. If there were an opportunity to do it through a small transaction, I will not be against it, but we have not found that yet.","Michael Schmidt, Ph.D. - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks and congrats on all the progress.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that was our final question. I'll now turn the conference back over to Mr. Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot for closing remarks. Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","No. Thank you. Thank you for the time today and for your question. As I said, I look back at 2016 in a way \u2013 with a lot of pride, because we spoke about the geography, I think that baricitinib moving forward is an important milestone now our company that has discovered two new products and that have been approved by health authorities and it would just be the fact that we for the first time crossed the revenue line of $1 billion, is also symbolically an important milestone. So we look forward to seeing some of you at upcoming investor and medical conferences. And for now, I would thank you again for your participation in the call today.

As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Michael Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Vice President-Investor Relations","Thank you, Diego. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's second quarter 2015 results conference call and webcast. The slides in today's presentation will be made available for download on the investor section of incyte.com after the call concludes.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, our CEO, will begin with a few words summarizing the quarter, and then Barry Flannelly, who leads our U.S. organization, will provide a commercial update on Jakafi. Rich Levy, who is in charge of Incyte's drug development activities, will update you on our clinical portfolio. And Dave Gryska, our CFO, will describe our second quarter financial results. Then we'll open up the call for Q&A, for which we'll be joined by Reid Huber, our Chief Scientific Officer, and Kevin Harris, VP-Global Product Strategy.","On the call today we will be discussing Jakafi, which is FDA-approved for patients with intermediate or high-risk myelofibrosis and for patients with polycythemia vera who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant of hydroxyurea.","In addition, we'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2015 guidance, the commercialization of Jakafi, our development plans for Jakafi and other indications and for other compounds in our pipeline. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2015 and from time to time in our other SEC documents.","With that, I would now like to pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for some opening remarks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone. We have had a very successful quarter on both the commercial and the clinical development side. And as promised today we are very pleased to include a more detailed review of the Jakafi launch to date in polycythemia vera.","So the commercialization of Jakafi continues with significant momentum and the launch in PV has added to Jakafi's gross. Today, we reported Q2 sales growth of 69% year-over-year and we have raised full-year 2015 net product revenue guidance for Jakafi to a range of $560 million to $575 million from the $525 million to $565 million previously communicated.","During Q2 we have also progressed as planned on the clinical front. We continue to recruit patients into the Phase III JANUS program and into the other solid tumor studies for both ruxolitinib and our JAK1 39110. The PD-1\/PD-L1 combination trials with epacadostat, our IDO1 inhibitor, are all recruiting well and the FGFR and BRD inhibitor programs are also recruiting patients.","Phase III data from baricitinib was presented at the EULAR conference in June and we also provided updates from the response study of ruxolitinib in PV and data from the novel:novel combination of JAK1 plus PI3K-delta at ASCO.","So before I close this short introduction, I want to emphasize how important and successful we believe this quarter was for Incyte. We expect the launch of Jakafi in PV to provide with us with a new growth driver for the future, as our research and development team continues to rapidly broaden our product portfolio, and we also expect that our financial discipline and strength will continue to allow flexibility in our resource allocation process.","I would now pass to Barry to give us details of our commercial performance in the quarter as well as some greater insight into the progress of the launch of Jakafi in PV.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone.","I'm looking forward to getting to know all of you better in the coming months and I'm also excited to begin my new role within Incyte leading our U.S. organization.","The sales of Jakafi accelerated in the second quarter, driven by uptake of Jakafi in the treatment of patients with uncontrolled polycythemia vera and continued growth in myelofibrosis.","In the second quarter we achieved $142 million in net sales of Jakafi. This represents a 69% increase over the same period last year and a 23% increase over the first quarter. Demand grew by19% quarter-over-quarter and inventory remains stable. On the next few slides, we'll review some of the key elements of the launch in polycythemia vera.","This graph plots the total number of prescribers that are new to Jakafi in the last two years. In the first half of 2015, we can see that the PV launch has led to a jump in the number of prescribers who are new to Jakafi, compared to previous periods. We have been consistently adding new prescribers for the MF indication through 2014, and since the launch in PV this analysis reveals that the breadth of prescribers has increased. This is consistent with our expectations because we expanded our targeting efforts to seek prescribers with high PD potential who may not be actively treating patients with myelofibrosis.","On slide nine we see a second piece of evidence that the Jakafi launch in polycythemia vera may have changed prescriber behavior. The PV launch has driven a shift in the utilization of 10 milligram tablets as the starting dose. The use of 10 milligrams as the starting dose has increased from approximately 25% during 2014, which represented use in MF only, up to approximately 43% during the first half of 2015, illustrating the impact of the PV launch.","As you know, there are five strengths of Jakafi tablets available and the recommended starting dose of Jakafi for patients with polycythemia vera is 10 milligrams twice daily. Recent market research is shown in the chart on slide 10, which shows the primary reasons that physicians gave for initiating therapy with Jakafi in patients with polycythemia vera.","As you can see, 80% of patients are switching from hydroxyurea to Jakafi based on an inadequate response to hydroxyurea, which might be needed to better control hematocrit, enlarged spleen or PV-related symptoms. The remainder of patients who have initiated Jakafi are either intolerant to hydroxyurea or who have specifically requested a change to Jakafi.","Patient identification has been a key area of focus for our launch efforts as we seek to educate healthcare professionals about the subset of patients who lack full disease control. As we stated on our Q1 call, the initial wave of PV patients taking Jakafi may have had, for example, elevated hematocrit and enlarged spleen and PV-related symptoms. Our challenge and also our opportunity is to help educate physicians about the need to also treat those patients who have elevated hematocrit or enlarged spleen or PV-related symptoms for whom hydroxyurea was inadequate.","Moving now to a measure of physician satisfaction with Jakafi, we asked that physicians who have used Jakafi for their measure of satisfaction with the drug, using a scale of 1 to 7, where 1 was not satisfied at all and 7 was extremely satisfied.","As you can see, the results of our recent market research are very positive and are reflective of the feedback we are receiving directly from both physicians and patients. We continue to focus our efforts on educating healthcare professionals on the importance of maintaining hematocrit consistently at or below 45% and the consequences of the lack of disease control. While most physicians are aware of 45% as a target level for hematocrit, the majority of physicians interviewed are willing to tolerate levels well above 45%, as shown in the chart on the right side of slide 12.","This is a key educational opportunity as we move forward. We expect to build steady and consistent momentum within the PV indication over time as we execute our launch plan, aiming to close educational gaps, clearly position Jakafi for patients with uncontrolled polycythemia vera, increase the breadth and depth of prescribing and reinforce positive experiences with Jakafi.","Slide 13 shows data that we have shared with you before, but with our indications for MF and PV combined. We have penetrated just over one-third of addressable myelofibrosis patients within our label and we are just starting to serve the approximately 25,000 uncontrolled polycythemia vera patients that we continue to believe are addressable within our PV indication. We expect that Jakafi has a long lifecycle ahead; recall that we have a composition of matter patent on ruxolitinib until 2027.","We are still at the beginning of our commercialization of Jakafi and we believe that steady and consistent growth of Jakafi in PV, combined with continued successful growth in MF, has the potential to represent a significant long-term commercial opportunity for Incyte. We are confident even with the expected level of future commercial competition that this long-term opportunity may result in a net product revenue reaching $1.5 billion for the U.S. Jakafi franchise in MPNs alone. In summary, the ongoing launch of Jakafi in PV has accelerated our top line by adding significantly to ongoing growth from our MF indication.","I'll now hand the call over to Rich to give us a brief update on clinical progress in the quarter.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Thanks, Barry. Beginning with our PV data from ASCO in June, we presented follow-up results from the pivotal RESPONSE trial of ruxolitinib in patients with uncontrolled polycythemia vera.","The table on the left shows that 83% of the patients were still receiving ruxolitinib at a median exposure of 111 weeks. And the right panel highlights the probability of maintaining the primary response in the ruxolitinib arm for at least 80 weeks starting from the time of initial response was 92%.","The second key data set we presented at ASCO were the initial results of the combination of 39110, our JAK1 selective inhibitor, plus 40093, our PI3K-delta inhibitor in patients with B-cell malignancies.","Slide 16 highlights aspects of the data from the Hodgkin's lymphoma cohort, which showed both deep, as displayed on the left, and durable, as displayed on the right, responses to the combination.","I'd like to emphasize that this trial was run in heavily pre-treated patients. For example, 70% of these Hodgkin's lymphoma patients received five or more prior lines of therapy. We're in the process of deciding on next steps for the combination and we'll provide more details when our plans are finalized.","Moving now to baricitinib, our JAK1\/JAK2 inhibitor as partnered with Lilly. The results of the first two Phase III studies in patients with rheumatoid arthritis were presented at the recent EULAR conference. The BEACON trial was a study of baricitinib versus placebo on a background of traditional DMARDs, including methotrexate, in patients who had already failed one or more TNF inhibitor-based regimens.","The BUILD trial was a similar design in patients with RA who had failed prior DMARDs but had not received TNF inhibitor-based therapy. Both BEACON and BUILD met their primary endpoints. And as an illustration, three of the BUILD slides from Lilly's webcast from EULAR are reproduced here. In terms of efficacy in the BUILD study, a significant effect of baricitinib versus placebo was seen across ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 scores at both 12 weeks and 24 weeks and in the structural endpoints at 24 weeks. The BUILD study, although not powered for a structural endpoint, getting through the analysis of structure, and the results were sufficiently robust that the 4 milligram dose of baricitinib showed statistically positive effects on the modified total Sharp score as well as each of its two components, the erosion score and the joint narrowing score.","The lower panel reviews the adverse events and shows that the incidents of adverse events, including serious infections with baricitinib, were similar to placebo.","Before the end of 2015, we and Lilly look forward to sharing data from the additional two Phase III studies of baricitinib in rheumatoid arthritis, including patients with early-stage disease in the BEGIN trial as well as the 1,300-patient BEAM study. BEAM includes a fully-powered comparison to Humira, the market-leading therapy for RA.","Slide 18 summarizes our current portfolio and I'll just briefly touch on a couple of aspects. The Phase III JANUS studies of ruxolitinib in pancreatic cancer are recruiting and the results of JANUS 1 are expected next year. We also have several proof-of-concept trials running for both ruxolitinib and our JAK1 inhibitor 39110.","In the first quarter we began dosing patients with our FGFR inhibitor. And in the second quarter we began dosing patients with our BRD inhibitor and both programs are making good progress. Additionally, all four of our epacadostat studies in combination with either anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 are progressing very well.","I'll now turn the call over to Dave to give us the financial highlights of the quarter. Dave?","David W. Gryska - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, Rich. Good morning, everybody. We recorded $142 million of second quarter net product revenues and $17 million of Jakafi royalties from Novartis for sales outside the United States. Our total revenue grew at 64% in the second quarter of 2015 over the second quarter of 2014 and reached $163 million. For the second quarter of 2015, R&D expense was $112 million and SG&A expense was $52 million, and we recorded an unrealized gain of $27 million from our investment in Agenus. We ended the quarter with $627 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.","Slide 21 shows our updated financial guidance for 2015. Given the strong performance of Jakafi in the first six months of the year, we are raising net product revenue guidance to a range of $560 million to $575 million; the previous range was $525 million to $565 million. As Rich detailed, our research and development activities are moving along as planned, and accordingly we are tightening our R&D guidance, lifting the bottom end of the range to give a revised range of $475 million to $500 million for full year 2015.","We are increasing our full-year SG&A guidance to a new range of $195 million to $210 million. This increase primarily reflects additional investments we are making in the commercialization of Jakafi.","Operator, that concludes our formal remarks. Please open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question today comes from Matt Roden with UBS. Please state your question.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for taking the question, and congrats on all the progress here. I wanted to \u2013 in the spirit of your now $1.5 billion peak sales estimate in the MPNs alone, I wanted to think about this year. And if I just apply sort of trends from prior years to your current first-half sales, I can get to numbers north of $600 million for this year. Just wondering, as you think about your guidance and the scenario, analyses and sensitivities to your numbers, if there is something that you're seeing that should rule out that type of possibility?","And then related, just wanted to know if you could talk about maybe the real-world experience of PV vis-\u00e0-vis the clinical trial experience, particularly with discontinuations. One of the remarkable points in our opinion of the Phase III PV studies was the very low discontinuation rate. So just wondering if you're seeing the same thing in the real world. Thanks very much.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks for the question. I will \u2013 on the first part of your question, I think the way you can look at the guidance is looking at the year-to-year growth rate that we are speaking about here, which is in the high 50s% to 60% growth from 2014 to 2015, and it's an acceleration of the growth. And I think it's reflecting the success of Jakafi in PV.","Concerning the rate of discontinuation, maybe, Barry, if you want to speak about that.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Sure, Matt. The best data that we have, as Rich just pointed out, is from the 80-week RESPONSE data looking at 83% of the patients still receiving therapy at 111 weeks. Now of course we only have six months really of experience with the launch of PV indication and we do begin to see a separation, just a little bit, between the persistence on MF and PV. But you would expect that. So in fact we'll have to see a lot more data, a lot more patients on Jakafi for PV, to get a real understanding of the long-term persistence, but the clinical trial data gives us confidence.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great, thanks very much, and congrats on the progress.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Co. Please state your question.","Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks for taking my question and congrats also on the progress. Maybe another one for Barry. I think in the past Incyte has been fairly explicit that it expects the PV launch to be more gradual than that in MF given I guess less urgency to treat. Is that still your view, with a good trajectory here that you're seeing? And in terms of the long-term guidance of $1.5 billion, maybe you could provide a target year for that guidance and a rough peak split between the two indications. I assume over time you think PV might be larger than MF.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Yeah. Thanks, Derek. We're very excited about the launch in polycythemia vera. We've gotten great uptake we think from our physicians who have patients who have PV who have prior hydroxyurea therapy. But I think, as we pointed out in the past, it's patient by patient, physician by physician.","One of the things I learned from a meeting we had with a group of physicians recently who treat PV patients is they really only see their patients about six times per year and that's to their office.","So in fact the physician may only see their patients a couple of times a year and mid-level providers are seeing the patients the other times. So really they have to see the patient and then identify that they have symptoms or they're uncontrolled on their current therapy in order to make a treatment decision to switch that therapy. So it is gradual, but it's consistent and we are really excited about what we've accomplished so far.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","On the second part of the question for splitting the sales between MF and PV, frankly we don't intend to do that. And there are a number reasons for it, but one of them is that it's not absolutely clear that for some patients if they have an actual diagnosis of MF or PV because there are a number of cases where it's not easy to see it.","What we believe over the long term, there is a guidance that we are giving of $1.5 billion is peak sales guidance, so it's something that you should look at in the longer term in the life of the product.","Eric Thomas Schmidt - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Hey, good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. Also add my congrats on a good quarter. Similar to what Matt had asked, I wanted to also go into the potential differences in the real world experience for PV from a duration standpoint. And obviously it's way too soon to say where this is ultimately going to settle out just given how robust the duration data was in the Phase III. So I realize this isn't apples-to-apples, but can you remind us of how Jakafi's real-world duration in MF has compared with clinical trials? And then I have a follow-up pipeline question.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So we've never been particularly quantitative about what the actual median duration of treatment is in the marketplace in MF. But it clearly was shorter than we saw in the clinical trials where the median duration of treatment was about three years. So I wouldn't be surprised personally if in the marketplace PV is a little bit less or somewhat less than it is in the clinical trials, but I would also think that the relative duration of treatment in the clinical trials of PV to MF would likely be borne out in clinical practice as well, but I can't really get quantitative about it.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay, understand. And then for baricitinib, is there anything that you can say as opposed to just differing to Lilly on the potential next steps for the diabetic neuropathy indication?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So they're in the process of trying to finalize plans for potential registration study. That includes discussions with outside experts as well as regulators. And until such time as their decisions are made, then they'll propose that to us as to whether or not we want to participate. We really can't say anything in specific other than the data from the Phase II was unexpectedly strong, and we believe that Lilly will go forward in some manner.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Your next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Leerink Partners. Please state your question.","Michael W. Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I had another one on the PV launch. To what degree has your co-pay assistance program affected the gross-to-net adjustment? And the second question on the pipeline, how should we think about news flow from the epacadostat PD-L1, PD-1 combination trials? Thank you.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So for the first question, the biggest part of our gross-to-net is really Medicare rebates, Medicaid rebates, VA, Department of Defense and 340B. So the co-pay Foundation is really a minor part of it. The biggest ones are really the government rebates.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","So on epacadostat, our IDO1 inhibitor, all four of the trials are moving along well, and we're in discussions with each of our partners about the appropriate timing of potential abstract submissions to medical meetings as well as if the data are robust enough moving forward into registration trial. So we can't be specific, we've said in the past, but certainly the latest that we would have data in the public domain would be some time next year.","Michael W. Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please state your question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one on PV here and in terms of new prescribers that use the drug for PV, are you also seeing a spillover effect from the doctors who may also use ruxolitinib in MF? And then secondly on the run rate for MF, are you seeing more new patients or kind of a plateau of new patients getting on to therapy for MF in this quarter? Thank you.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Sure. In terms of prescribers, as you can imagine the vast majority of prescribers for both MF and PV are the same docs. It just so happens that we found a group of prescribers that hadn't experienced the use of Jakafi in MF and once they started using the drug in PV they may in fact have MF patients that they then prescribe for.","And the second question was...","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Oh, in terms of quarterly new patient as addition (27:15)","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Sorry, we continue to have a steady, consistent growth in MF patients. We think that the growth in MF is going to contribute well to the full-year sales this year. And both MF and PV new patients continue to grow.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with Nomura. Please state your question.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities","Thanks and congratulations on a great quarter. One question on just the sort of the market dynamics. I was wondering if you could speak to the payer mix as you launch into PV. And a question on IDO. Is there a scenario where you would have enough data in-house to be confident enough to announce start of pivotal studies prior to the data presentation at ASCO next year?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Sure. So I'll take the first question. In terms of payer mix specifically for PV, we think it's a slightly younger population, so you might see a little bit less Medicare patients. But it's pretty much consistently the same. And in terms of commercial payers, it's exactly the same and coverage really hasn't been an issue for PV.","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","So on the IDO progress, I mean we have certain meetings that come up and they control the timing of when there is detailed presentations of the data. But that doesn't drive the timing around our decisions to move into registration trials.","So if the data are sufficiently robust before then, we would not be waiting for ASCO to announce something; it could happen sooner.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities","Is it possible for you to give us some sense of timing when you would have in essence enough data to make that decision?","Barry P. Flannelly - Executive Vice President & General Manager","Not really. I mean, there is quantity of data and then there is direction of data and they're both important to being able to make those decisions. So I really don't want to try to get into prognosticating when that might be.","Ian Somaiya - Nomura Securities","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Chris Marai with Oppenheimer. Please state your question.","Michelle Gilson - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi guys, this is actually Michelle on for Chris. We're wondering how you look at your partnerships. We recall that a competitor had said on their call \u2013 Roche, actually \u2013 that their molecule has characteristics \u2013 this is in regards to IDO inhibitor \u2013 that their molecule has characteristics that are similar to and they feel pharmacologically superior to -they specifically cited your molecule.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So I think we're not going to comment on the preclinical profiles of the compound. I think most relevant is to see the emerging clinical profile and then we will have something that is better relatable to the emerging epacadostat profile. I'll say that we continue to be very pleased with potency, the safety, the pharmacokinetics of epacadostat in the ongoing program and see little opportunity for another compound that's also an IDO of one selective inhibitor to significantly differentiate. So our focus right now is on trying to maintain the competitive gap we have and we think that's a very important asset to the portfolio.","Michelle Gilson - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Right, great. And then just a follow-up to that. I guess are you guys looking towards spending maybe a little bit more to speed up the clinical development of your IDO and maybe your BRD too, the ones that are in very competitive spaces, to provide that competitive advantage, just when we're thinking about the profitability and balance sheet going forward?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So the amount of money that we're spending is not what is controlling the timelines at this point. I mean so first of all, if you look at the IDO studies that are being done with PD1 inhibitors, you need to start at a relatively low dose and you need to wait certain amounts of time before you can go to the next dose level and then you want to generate enough data within any particular tumor type to make a decision as to whether or not you're going to go forward or not.","Each of those things are progressing as quickly as we had hoped. Throwing more money at it would not make it go any faster. What we are committed to is, should the data be robust enough, we are going to make a fast and large commitment to registration studies and remain well ahead of our closest competitors.","Michelle Gilson - Oppenheimer & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right, great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt Roden with UBS. Please state your question.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the follow-up. As it relates to baricitinib, can you address the competitive landscape in rheumatoid arthritis, particularly any thoughts, Rich or Reid, you may have on recent filgotinib data, anything that is worth pointing out from a compare and contrast perspective? And then related, what are your expectations for the BEAM study in terms of the comparison to Humira? Thanks.","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Okay. So with respect to the JAK1 selective inhibitor where there's Phase II data out there. I mean first of all, we believe that the Phase II data are quite acceptable, but Phase III is really going to be key and let me tell you a couple of reasons why. So first of all, we have seen with our own JAK1 inhibitor, and now it's confirmed also with the JAK1 inhibitor from Galapagos, that in order to see sort of the top range of efficacy you really need to get to high levels of JAK1 inhibition compared to the levels of JAK1 and JAK2 inhibition that you need with balanced inhibitors.","And that level of inhibition is quite high. And it's not to say that there is a problem with that, it's just not been tested over the long term yet. So we need to see the Phase III safety data as much as anything else to see whether those levels of JAK1 inhibition are going to give you the type of safety profile that's needed to be successful in a drug for rheumatoid arthritis.","Other things that we would say are that, even after you correct for trying to take out what the placebo responses is, there's still dangers in trying to compare across studies; head-to-heads are the gold standard, of course. And then finally, assuming that they are going to start Phase III studies approximately at the beginning of 2016, that would put them a full three years behind where baracitinib started Phase III and we would expect a full three years behind in terms of time to launch.","You had another question?","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. I was going to ask about your expectations for the BEAM comparison to Humira?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","Sure. So one of the big upside positives coming out of the data that's already been presented was the structure data coming out of a study that was about half the size of the BEAM trial. So I would expect that, given the designs of this trial, that that would be fine.","With respect to the expectations against Humira, again with the difficulty of comparing across trials I think our results have been as good or numerically slightly better than historical data with Humira. The study is adequately powered that it has the potential to show superiority if the results are consistent with some of the data that we've seen. But simply having non-inferiority to Humira across the board for a drug that is orally \u2013 it's an oral once-a-day treatment we think would lead to an attractive profile.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","And what are the metrics we should be looking at? Is it the ACR scores or the DAS28 or is it the structural data?","Richard S. Levy - Chief Drug Development Officer & Executive VP","So the way that it works, and I can't get into all the details, is first you look at superiority to negative control arm, then you look at structure and then you look at non-inferiority to Humira I believe based on ACR20 but I'm not 100% sure. And then you start to look at potential for superiority both based on DAS and ACR scores and I just can't recall exactly what the order in which that is done. But certainly we expect to be able to get to those analyses while still preserving alpha to make a statistical comparison on efficacy.","Matthew M. Roden - UBS Securities LLC","Super helpful.

Please go ahead.","Michael Booth","Thank you, Brook. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's third quarter 2019 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investors section of incyte.com.","I am joined on the call today by Herv\u00e9, Barry, Steven and Christiana, who will deliver our prepared remarks and by Dash who will join us for the Q&A session.","During the question-and-answer session, I ask that you limit yourself to one question and, if needed, one follow-up as this will enable as many of you to ask questions as time allows.","Before we begin, however, I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2019 guidance, the commercialization of our products and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline, as well as the development plans of our collaboration partners.","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2019, and from time to time in our other SEC documents.","We'll now begin the call with Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Mike. And good morning, everyone. Incyte continues to execute well across all aspects of the business and we have delivered multiple positive updates from our late-stage portfolio in recent weeks and our product and royalty revenues continue to grow at a remarkable rate for a company of our size.","Product and royalty revenues in the third quarter grew at 24% over the same period last year, totaling over $530 million and including $433 million in Jakafi sales which increased 25% in Q3.","Sales of in Iclusig in Europe as well as royalties from Jakavi and Olumiant also increased year-over-year.","At the beginning of 2019, we set out an ambitious list of R&D goal for the year and I'm pleased to report today that we have already achieved a majority of them.","The NDA for pemigatinib, seeking approval as a treatment for patients with FGFR2-driven cholangiocarcinoma, has been submitted to the FDA and the positive updated data that supported the submission were presented in September at ESMO.","We recently reported that REACH2, the Phase III trial evaluating ruxolitinib in steroid-refractory acute GVHD, met its primary endpoint of superiority over best available therapy.","These data further reinforce the efficacy of Jakafi as the standard of care treatment option for these patients following FDA approval in this indication in May.","We were also pleased to provide 52-week follow-up data from our randomized Phase II trial of ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo at EAGV. These data show that patients treated with higher concentration of rux cream experienced continued improvement in their disease with additional time on therapy. And we have already launched a global Phase III program for rux cream in vitiligo with results due in 2021.","We still have some key items we expect to deliver before the end of the year. But for now, I'll turn the call over to Barry for an update on Jakafi.","Barry Flannelly","Thank you, Herv\u00e9. And good morning, everyone. Net product revenues for Jakafi were very strong in the quarter, totaling $433 million. This is an increase of 25% when compared to the same period last year. ","Growth was primarily driven by patient demand, which grew 18% year-over-year and there were no appreciable effects of inventory in the quarter.","Because of the strong demand for Jakafi today, we are very pleased to be increasing both the bottom and top end of full-year 2019 guidance for net sales of Jakafi to a new range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion.","We're seeing good demand for Jakafi in all three approved indications. More than 50% of eligible myelofibrosis patients in the US are currently on Jakafi. And total patients on therapy increased approximately 5% year-over-year.","We continue to be encouraged by the growth we see in this indication, especially in its eighth year since approval.","Patient growth in polycythemia vera continues to be higher than myelofibrosis. And within the eligible population, Jakafi has reached more than 20% penetration.","We saw an opportunity to increase disease awareness in both PD, patient and physician community; and in an effort to augment patient voice, we recently launched a pilot television and social media disease awareness campaign. This pilot was conducted in several key target markets where it has been very well received and we have now expanded the education campaign nationwide.","This is the first full quarter of sales since approval in steroid refractory acute GVHD. And while early, the launch is currently outpacing our internal expectations. Importantly, we're seeing comprehensive access in both the inpatient and outpatient treatment settings and we continue to see strong uptake and broad utilization across bone marrow transplant centers.","I'll now turn the call over to Steven for the clinical update.","Steven Stein ","Thanks, Barry. And good morning, everyone. Continuing with graft-versus-host disease, we were pleased to report the positive outcome for REACH2, the randomized trial of ruxolitinib versus best available therapy in steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease.","We plan to share these data with the FDA for inclusion in the Jakafi label. And we look forward to sharing the detailed data with you at an upcoming scientific meeting.","REACH3, the randomized trial evaluating ruxolitinib in patients with steroid-refractory chronic graft-versus-host disease is ongoing and has almost completed recruitment.","A recent interim efficacy and safety analysis conducted by an independent data monitoring committee recommended that REACH3 should continue without modification with results expected in 2020.","Moving on to pemigatinib for cholangiocarcinoma, slide 11 shows the data that were presented at ESMO and which formed the basis of our recent New Drug Application.","As you can see, in cohort A, the overall response rate was 36%. Median progression-free survival was 6.9 months and median overall survival was 21.1 months.","Importantly, the vast majority of patients have some degree of tumor size reduction as evidenced by the 82% disease control rate and as illustrated in the waterfall plot on slide 11.","We believe that pemigatinib offers a meaningful improvement over the current standard of care in the second line, which typically results in single-digit response rates, median progression-free survival of 3 months and an overall survival of approximately 6 months.","The most common adverse event of all grades was hyperphosphatemia, which is an on target effect of FGFR inhibition that can be managed with a low phosphate diet, phosphate binders and diuretics. Hypophosphatemia occurred in 23% of patients which was likely due to the treatment for hyperphosphatemia. Serous retinal detachment was seen in 4% of patients, which is mostly grade 1 or 2.","If you recall, the only potential curative therapy for cholangiocarcinoma is surgery, but approximately 70% of patients are diagnosed with unresectable disease. So, the need for new therapeutic options for these patients is clear.","My third slide summarizes updated data from the randomized Phase II trial of ruxolitinib cream in vitiligo, which were presented a few weeks ago at EADV. These data showed continued improvement and re-pigmentation with additional time on therapy as objectively measured by VASI scores.","For example, in patients dosed with 1.5% b.i.d. and followed for 52 weeks, the facial VASI75 was achieved in 52% of patients, up from 30% of patients at 24 weeks. And the facial VASI90 was achieved in 33% of patients, up from 12% at 24 weeks.","The global Phase III program of ruxolitinib cream in patients with vitiligo is ready and rolling, with the facial VASI75 at 24 weeks being the primary endpoint and we expect the result to be available in 2021.","With that, I would like to turn the call over to Christiana for a financial update. ","Christiana Stamoulis ","Thanks, Steven. And good morning, everyone. The financial update this morning will include GAAP and non-GAAP numbers. For a full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP, please refer to slides 19 and 20 in the backup section of the deck and to the press release we issued this morning.","Our third quarter results reflect continued strong growth with total product and royalty revenues of $534 million, representing an increase of 24% over the third quarter of 2018. This is comprised of $433 million in Jakafi and $21 million in Iclusig net product revenues, $58 million in Jakafi royalties from Novartis and $22 million in Olumiant royalties from Lilly. We also recognized $18 million in contracts revenues under our collaboration agreement with Zai Lab, resulting in total revenues for the quarter of $552 million.","Our total costs and expenses for the quarter on a non-GAAP basis of $365 million decreased by 1% from the prior-year quarter. ","Ongoing R&D expenses for the quarter was $251 million on a non-GAAP basis, unchanged from the prior-year period, reflecting our decision to reallocate capital from the co-funding of baricitinib and the development of epacadostat to our other late stage development programs.","SG&A expenses for the quarter was $90 million on a non-GAAP basis, representing a 6% increase over the prior-year quarter.","Moving to our guidance for 2019, given the strong performance of Jakafi in the first nine months of the year, we are increasing Jakafi full-year guidance to a range of $1.65 billion to $1.68 billion.","Our guidance for both current R&D and SG&A remains the same as we continue to invest in our commercial operations and our clinical development portfolio and we expect certain of these expenses to be more backend loaded into Q4 2019.","I will now turn the call back to Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thank you, Christiana. So, our last slide reminds you of our progress to date in 2019 as the well as the remaining key news flow events we expect during the year.","These expectations includes NDA submission by Novartis for capmatinib in patients with MET exon-14 skipping mutation in non-small cell lung cancer. ","Capmatinib is another development candidate discovered in Incyte laboratories and has the potential to be an important product in lung cancer. It was really positioned in the Novartis third quarter material as a key approval for them in 2020.","And for Incyte, capmatinib also has the potential to be a meaningful contributor to our top line with over $500 million in potential milestone and 12% to 14% royalties on global net sales.","We're also looking forward to having the result of the GRAVITAS 301 trial of itacitinib in first-line acute GVHD in-house at the end of the year. Itacitinib has the potential to be another key contributor to near-term revenue growth. ","With this strong execution across our late-stage development programs, we're making significant progress toward our strategic goals of adding diversification to the top line and further accelerating revenue growth.","And that concludes our prepared remarks and we're now happy to take your questions. Operator, please give your instructions and open the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Salveen Richter of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Salveen Richter","Thanks for taking my question. So, with regard to the early uptake and feedback for Jakafi in GVHD, what does that suggest for the trajectory here? And have there been any gating factors?","And then, a follow-up for Herv\u00e9, given the progress of your pipelines in both oncology and IAI, how are you thinking about business development opportunities?","Steven Stein","Sure, Salveen. So, GVHD, as I said, the uptake has been very good since the beginning. We think the opportunity for itacitinib is ultimately where the opportunity is live. Jakafi is giving patients benefit right now. We believe it will give benefit in acute GVHD as we are now and then in the future for chronic GVHD and we await the results of GRAVITAS-301 for itacitinib and a potential worldwide for that drug.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","So, Salveen, on the progress of the late-stage portfolio, obviously, you know our strategic goal of diversification and growth. That's really what we are aiming at. And, obviously, a lot of it is starting to take place with pemigatinib. We spoke a little bit about capmatinib, which is not always the most known of our pipeline products that Novartis \u2013 has been licensed to Novartis. So, we are on a good track to succeed on getting these products to market over the next few years.","At the same time, we're, obviously, looking at BD opportunities that would fit with our portfolio. We're mostly looking at oncology, hematology type of assets. And it's a continuous process where we're reviewing opportunities and we're expecting \u2013 we hope to be able to gain some additional products to fuel the growth of the top line in the next few years.","Salveen Richter","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Marc Frahm of Cowen and Company. Please go ahead. ","Marc Frahm","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe for Barry. In the prepared remarks, you mentioned that the awareness campaign PV, you're having some success. Can you maybe define that a little bit better? Are you already seeing an uptick in sales within those regions or is it more qualitative measures? And then, what type of budget are we talking about, now that you're expanding it nationally and trying to broaden that success? ","Barry Flannelly","Well, the way we measure uptake, it's very early. As we said, we did it in five key markets across the country first. And what we saw there was really the uptake in social media sites. For example, TakeActionPV is what we direct patients to go to or healthcare professionals to go to get more information. There is education materials there, materials they can download to track their symptoms. And we saw spikes in those first five key regions.","Now, as we expanded across the nation, which only started October 1, so we don't really have all that much data yet, but it certainly has grown dramatically on those sites that we're sending patients to.","The budget nationwide is relatively small. This is a 30-second commercial. We're placing it at time periods that we think patients will see it, but at the same time don't cost a fortune. So, it's not going to the Super Bowl, but it is, in fact, we think being very effective as an educational tool for patients and healthcare professionals.","Marc Frahm","Very good. And then, maybe a sort of follow-up on kind of market dynamics for Jakafi. Maybe some comments on what the initial impacts of fedratinib's launch that you may or may not have seen yet.","Barry Flannelly","I think it's early. We haven't really seen much of an impact yet. We know that Celgene is really positioning it as a second line agent just by their pricing strategy that they came out with and then, very particularly, their marketing materials that we have seen are positioning it as a second line drug. Maybe you also are aware that the only two clinical trials that they have ongoing now, a single arm trial and a Phase III trial compared to best available therapy, are both after Jakafi. So, clearly, they're positioning it for a second line drug and we haven't seen the impact yet on Jakafi. And we're fully confident because we have long-term follow-up data, eight years of data, more than 50,000 patients treated in the United States with the drug. So, the safety profile is there. And, of course, an overall survival advantage that I don't think that fedratinib will ever be able to achieve, particularly with their JAKARTA study because it was never followed up on.","Marc Frahm","Right. Great. Thank you. ","Operator","The next question is from Tyler Van Buren of Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead.","Tyler Van Buren","Hey, guys. Good morning. Great to see the sold results on the quarter. Just had a couple follow-up questions to Marc's line of questionings. As you look at Jakafi in MF and PV, can you give us an update on duration of treatment for both of those indications? Also, as we think about long-term in terms of PV, could we see ultimate penetration of the patient population to reach kind of that 50% level that we're seeing with MF? And perhaps, just some updated thoughts on the long-term guidance that you guys gave for last year? I believe it was $2.5 billion to $3 billion by 2027. If we see the continued growth in PV and GVHD, that seems exceedingly achievable. So, I'd be interested to hear your updated thoughts.","Barry Flannelly","Sure, Tyler. This is Barry. We're still confident of the $2.5 billion to $3 billion long-term guidance. So, that's clear.","In terms of persistence, its' what we've said all along, to be honest with you. I think we have to turn to the clinical trials for persistence. When you look at PV, when you look at the response data, you saw 83% of patients were still on therapy at two years. And in the COMFORT trial, you saw that 50% of the patients were still on it three years. So, that's still our touchstone for persistence.","In PV, we continue to grow year-over-year this year. We grew total patients in PV 15% year-over-year and that continues to exceed the continued growth in patients in MF. So, we see that, in PV, we'll catch-up to the MF patients sooner or later and we certainly are confident that the clinical profile of Jakafi and polycythemia vera patients could hit the 50% mark at some point.","Tyler Van Buren","Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Abrahams of RBC. Please go ahead.","Brian Abrahams","Hi there. Thanks so much for taking my questions and congratulations on the strong quarter. On GVHD, can you provide any perspectives on the REACH3 stopping rule at the interim and maybe frame expectations now that that readout has been pushed out to next year?","And related to that, I'm curious your latest views on the potential impact of JAK1 versus pan-JAK inhibition on the potential for efficacy in GVHD and the bar for the itacitinib read-out now that you guys have more clinical and commercial experience in this space. Thanks.","Steven Stein","Yeah. Hi, it's Steven. So, in terms of REACH3, we don't normally guide to interim results, but this time working with our partner, Novartis, we obviously did expect to potentially have some results by the end of 2019.","As you can see, the study at interim made it through the interim analysis by the IDMC and they recommend it to continue the study to completion without modification.","The recruitment itself is about to finish. We literally have only a few patients left. There is always a higher \u2013 by the nature of an interim, there is always a higher bar to achieve at interim analysis to close the study because you have to be very careful that you do it appropriately. So, we're not at all worried. We remain extremely confident in the data set. ","The primary endpoint in the chronic graft-versus-host disease study is an overall response rate at month 6, but there are numerous secondary endpoints that are important here including failure-free survival, symptom improvement, overall survival and others. So, sometime in 2020 we'll get those results. We remain extremely confident in that.","And as I \u2013 just to reiterate, it was a little unusual for us to guide to an interim, but again working with a partner, that's what we did.","In terms of reading through to itacitinib in a more JAK1 agent relatively more \u2013 hits JAK1 more than the other JAKs, we saw our proof-of-concept data for itacitinib. It was strong across the spectrum of disease. But it was even stronger in steroid-na\u00efve acute graft-versus-host disease, which is why \u2013 which led to GRAVITAS-301.","In addition, patients with steroid-na\u00efve acute graft-versus-host-disease are immediately post bone marrow transplant or allogeneic transplant tend to be sicker, tend to have cytopenia, particularly low white cell counts and low platelets. So, to have a relative JAK2 sparing agent that doesn't cause as much cytopenia as the others is potentially beneficial from a therapeutic ratio point of view. But in terms of the biology of the disease, it ameliorates the biology appropriately and again we remain confident in that.","Brian Abrahams","That's really helpful. Thanks, Steven.","Operator","The next question is from Michael Schmidt of Guggenheim. Please go ahead.","Michael Schmidt","Hey, thanks for taking my questions. I just had a follow-up on GVHD as well. I think you said the launch is outpacing your internal expectations. Just wondering if you could help us with a little bit more information around what treatment share do you have at this point and maybe what percentage of top line sales was contributed by GVHD?","Barry Flannelly","Sure, Michael. Well, treatment share, I'm not exactly sure. I think that we're the most used agents maybe already in the second line setting, but I can't be sure of that. Trying to get information on GVHD is a little bit harder than MF and PV since it's all hospital used. So, that's it.","So, I think, last year, I said something like \u2013 with spontaneous use and then with the approval, we'd hit somewhere around $80 million for this year. I think we're ahead of that, but I can't give you an exact \u2013 the number for that. But we're very pleased with the uptake in GVHD. And we think with now the REACH2 data, it will even be stronger in the future.","Michael Schmidt","Great, thanks. And then, maybe a bigger picture question for Herv\u00e9. So, regarding the earlier stage pipeline, I guess you're pursuing both new immuno therapies as well as targeted oncology drugs. And, obviously, there's been some very interesting data generated in the last couple of years, specifically with TKIs going after driving mutations, including pemigatinib, obviously, but there are other targets as well.","On the other hand, I think many would agree that the success rate for new immunooncology drugs has been rather mixed, I guess in that context. I was just wondering how do you see your bigger picture patent strategy evolve longer-term going after both areas.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Thanks for the question. Because as you see, it's very important and it's a field where the effect of the decisions we made over the past two years are always seen with a delay. So, we were \u2013 obviously, with the very heavy share of the research effort in immunooncology and immunity in general, which led to a number of other project beyond oncology, and what has been happening over the past two years is a rebalance where we have now more targeted therapies or targeted \u2013 targeting oncogenic mutation type of projects that are the larger part of our portfolio. At the same time, we're keeping immuno projects today. So, I would say it's a balance and it's probably in the 60-40 or 40-60 kind of ratio where maybe, in the past, it was more heavy on the immune aspect. And, Dash, if you want to speak about it.","Dashyant Dhanak","Yes. Thanks for the question, Michael. Just to sort of echo what Herv\u00e9 was saying, I think you're right, at some level, the promise in immunooncology has been tampered by clinical data. However, we still think there's plenty of opportunities out there in both the targeted and the immunooncology space. You'll remember or you'll know from our sort of access to modalities that we have both for molecule and biologics capability. So, having both of those options open to us does keep the entire area open. And we have a number of programs that we think will enter the clinic in the coming months that target both going after a very sort of traditional targeted therapeutic approach, as well as an immuno approach and then combinations thereof.","Michael Schmidt","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Cory Kasimov of JP Morgan. Please go ahead.","Cory Kasimov","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. First one for you is on expenses. So, SG&A and R&D both came in pretty meaningfully below expectations for the quarter, but guidance was unchanged, which would imply a decent step up in 4Q just to get to the low end of your range. So, is that something we should be anticipating? And maybe to the extent you're willing to qualitatively comment on trends into 2020, do you have any kind of preliminary big picture expense thoughts going forward? And I have one follow up.","Christiana Stamoulis","Hi, Cory. It's Christiana. Thank you for your question. First of all, big picture in terms R&D and SG&A costs, we continue to invest, aggressively invest in our clinic and development portfolio as well as on our commercial operations. What you're seeing with R&D this year and the expenses coming on the lower side is that we were able to reallocate expenses that were previously for epacadostat and baricitinib to our other stage development programs. So, that allowed us to be able to push forward the other development programs without seeing an increase in R&D.","Going forward, however, as we have discussed in the past, we are looking to invest in R&D based on the quality and the progress of the program. So, based on data and merits of the programs, if those programs progress through later-stage of development, you would expect that to drive R&D expenses.","In terms of Q4, we reiterated the guidance that we provided on both R&D and SG&A because there is a timing factor for some of the expenses on both lines that we expect to be more back-end loaded into Q4 of 2019 and, therefore, we continue to be comfortable with the initial guidance that we have provided.","Cory Kasimov","Okay. That's helpful. And then, my follow-up is a quick one for Steven. How much patient follow-up will you wait for in that FIGHT-201 pemi bladder study before potentially top lining that data?","Steven Stein","Hi, Cory. It's Steven. So, typically, across the board, ballpark follow-up in these sort of studies required by regulatory agencies is around 12 months, but that's for your last responder. So, what I'm saying is you complete recruitment if that very last patient to respond to you typically require about 12 months. So, if you think, we've just recently completed recruitment on the study, we're looking that data sometime mid-2020 or beyond to get a complete view of that picture across the board on our bladder data.","Cory Kasimov","Okay, perfect. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","The next question is from Evan Seigerman of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Evan Seigerman","Hi, all. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the progress. So, Christiana, one for you. How would you characterize your capacity to transact? I know Herv\u00e9 mentioned some high level thoughts on BD and then I have a follow-up on that. Just, basically, what are some characteristics of assets that you would consider bringing in house. So, one for, Christiana, and one for you, Herv\u00e9.","Christiana Stamoulis","So, in terms of the capacity, as we have discussed in the past, we have a strong balance sheet. We currently have $2 billion of cash on our balance sheet. That gives us the opportunity to consider bringing in external assets to our internal portfolio.","In terms of the nature of the assets, we are looking at programs that could contribute to revenue diversification and growth in the mid-term timeframe. So, continuing to add to growth as we are getting closer to the Jakafi potential patent expiry period. So, bringing additional growth drivers then, obviously, makes a lot of sense for us.","So, do you want to\u2026?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Yeah. The type of assets is very clear. The first is, obviously, hematology oncology, anything that would be good science, that would be innovative, that would provide a benefit that is unique in the field of cancer treatment could fit with our portfolio where we have a very strong hematology franchise both in Europe and the US and where we have this emerging solid tumor franchise also in the US and a little bit later in Europe. So, that makes sense.","In terms of timing, we're looking at the window between 25 and 30 and it's very obvious why. Because that's where we will need more diversification. So, some of the aspect is to complement our MF and PV franchises where there are new mechanisms that can be complementary to what we have in our portfolio and where obviously our leadership in MF and PV could be reinforced by external assets if any benefit could be shown from this.","And then, we have a little bit of a longer view on the non-oncology aspect. As we said, we will be commercializing our rux cream in the US. We may have partnership, if needed, but we will be leading the commercialization in the US.","We will be partnering our dermatology assets outside of Europe and US and we're still looking at what the best strategy for Europe. So, there, there could be also potential BD aspect to the dermatology franchise. We're very confident in the benefit we are showing both in atopic dermatitis and, as you saw, in vitiligo. It's a fairly striking data with the long term follow-up. And we believe there is a true value in this franchise and complementing it with external assets could be an option. It's not absolutely mandatory because we believe in the US we can build the team to successfully commercialize, but there could be some complement to it.","So, it's very clear. It's hematology oncology for 25 to 30 where \u2013 that's where the contribution to the top line would be the most valuable. It's lifecycle management of MF and PV. And potentially, if we find the right assets in dermatology or somewhere in non-cancer immunology, it could be also another dimension.","Evan Seigerman","Okay. And then, I just follow up there. Are we talking $1 billion, $2 billion or really how would you give color on that in terms of what you'd pay?","Christiana Stamoulis","So the main focus is on what I would characterize as tuck-in type of assets that we can bring in, either through licensing or M&A. So, we're agnostic in terms of the structure, whatever makes sense.","Evan Seigerman","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Jay Olson of Oppenheimer & Co. Please go ahead.","Jay Olson","Hey, guys. Congrats on the quarter and all the progress. I had a couple of questions. Could you comment on what were the best available therapies to Jakafi in REACH2 and is there overlap between those best available therapies in REACH2 and REACH3?","And then, just to follow-up on pemigatinib. Could you provide some additional color on how the enrollment is going in FIGHT-205 and FIGHT-207 and also the bladder cancer continuous dosing cohort?","Steven Stein","Yeah. Hi. Jay, it's Steven. Thank you for your question. So, both REACH2 and REACH3 are randomized studies against best available therapy. Just to mention, REACH2, that we've just said, reported out as positive and will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting.","To our knowledge, it's the first randomized study in graft-versus-host disease that has reported out as positive. So, that's really good news, obviously, for patients and for us. ","The therapies themselves are listed on clinicaltrials.gov, but just to give you a sense, there are slight differences because they are different disease entities. For REACH2, they include things like anti-thymocyte globulin, extracorporeal photopheresis, there is mesenchymal stromal cells, low-dose methotrexate, mycophenolate and even EMTO inhibitors like Everolimus can be used.","For REACH3, there's some overlap, but they also in addition \u2013 because chronic graft-versus-host disease include therapies like rituximab and imatinib as well as ibrutinib which is approved in chronic graft-versus-host disease. The complete list is available on clintrials.gov.","In enrollment, to the second part of your question on the studies you mentioned for the entirety of the pemigatinib program, obviously, includes our completed first part in cholangiocarcinoma and then the ongoing first line study there. Then the large bladder cancer program and then the tumor agnostic as well as smaller entities that we don't speak about much, but very important to patients is an 8p11 myeloproliferative neoplasm.","We don't guide to exact dates in terms of enrollment other than when we start and sometimes when we end the studies. But just to give you a sense that the agnostic study, 207, which you mentioned has started enrollment and we'll be looking at different driver mutations there. And then, we expect to complete, as I just alluded to, the second line bladder study before the end of this year and have data latter part of next year. And then, we're about to start the first line bladder study. So, that gives you a sense of the cadence of enrollment and the entirety of the program.","Jay Olson","Great. Thanks for taking the questions.","Operator","The next question is from Reni Benjamin of JMP Securities. Please go ahead.","Reni Benjamin","Hey, good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the questions. And congratulations on a great quarter. I guess, just as a follow-up regarding the REACH2 data, Steven, is there anything there that kind of increases your confidence in regards to REACH3 or are the two diseases really separate and distinct, acute versus chronic?","Steven Stein","Reni, thank you. It was great to see a randomized study against best available therapy being positive. And again, as I just said, we look forward to sharing those results to you. So, it further does increase our confidence in what we already know, say that ruxolitinib is a really good drug for steroid-refractory acute graft-versus-host disease.","Chronic does have a slightly different pathophysiology as it's more a disease of fibrosis with more skin manifestations as opposed to more apoptotic disease in acute where there's more sort of cell death in the liver and GI tract. But there's enough overlap and our proof-of-concept data was strong enough that we remain confident in chronic graft-versus-host disease.","We do think, although the pathophysiology, there's a little bit of a difference, there's a good read through and we're confident in getting that data next year.","Reni Benjamin","Got it. And then just as a follow-up, the vitiligo studies have started, can you give us any sort of a sense of \u2013 if its enrollment is on track and on schedule and have all the sites open?","Steven Stein","Yeah. So, you're correct. The vitiligo studies have started. As you saw in my formal presentation, we just presented the 52-week data at the EADV with continuing improvement, quite dramatic in patients through one year. The studies have just recently started.","But I will tell you, it's a pleasant surprise to us working in dermatology, these studies accrue really, really well. So, with sites open quickly, we have dictated dermatology centers across the globe who are good at doing clinical research, who put patients on quickly and we're up and going with gusto and very positive about it.","Reni Benjamin","Thank you for taking the questions.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is from Alethia Young of Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.","Alethia Young","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Congrats on the quarter. One, maybe Steve, can you talk a little bit about best supportive care for REACH3 and how it varies across the world? And do you think there's any kind of variability there that you should consider in the trial that is ongoing?","And the second question probably is more for maybe Herv\u00e9. I guess I'm just curious how you think about kind of long-term margins for the business and where we are exactly in kind of the peak cycle for Jakafi. It seems like there's still a lot of room to move and you're building in PV kind of an awareness and there's penetration that could be had, but maybe if you can frame that from a high level perspective, that would be helpful. Thanks.","Steven Stein","Hi, Alethia. It's Steven. So, you do allude to something we see in graft-versus-host disease, not only across the world, but even within the United States and even within cities themselves, there are treatment differences in patterns at bone marrow transplant centers and how people have treated this condition to date and continue to, both in terms of preparative regimens and actual regimens, which is exactly why for best available therapy we have to account for a number of therapies.","So, there's no dramatic differences across the world compared to just, as I said, even within the US itself. We always, as a matter of course, do analyses and look at differences if there are any between different parts of the world to explain response rates, et cetera. So, those analyses will be done. Typically, you do the US, Western Europe and rest of world analyses and we'll look at those. But nothing to be concerned about.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot ","Yeah. Regarding the cycle, the sort of medium to long term cycle of the business, obviously, the growth of Jakafi in the US is very key to the entire P&L of Incyte. As you can see, this quarter, Incyte is growing even faster than the previous one versus last year. And our Q3 last year was a little bit lower maybe than it should have been. So, the ratio of the 25% growth for Jakafi US maybe slightly higher than the true trend. Although the year, I think we are more in the 20%, which is still very, very strong for sort of a seventh, eighth year of commercialization. And we see a lot of potential for continued growth of Jakafi in the US in MF. It is still volume growth. Patient volume is increasing in MF.","And in PV, as we said, there is larger potential for two reasons. It's because treatment rate is still on the low end, below 50%, and the duration of treatment for every patient studied on Jakafi is very much longer than what we have in MF. So, what we see is sort of chronicization of the disease in MF that is leading to this growth potential that is obviously higher.","We are not changing the long-term guidance very frequently, but we have made a lot of progress throughout the number that we gave a few years ago of 2.5 to 3, and that's something we are very confident in.","Regarding the P&L itself and the margin, as Christiana said, we are investing in R&D based on the quality and the required work for the assets that we have. And so, it may be fluctuating, as you have seen. When epacadostat did not work as planned, to say the least, you could see that it has a positive impact on the R&D, which is obviously the paradox of our industry, is that if you stop a project, it will improve margins. But, obviously, our goal is not to manage the margin short-term proactively, but to maximize the value to the company and the shareholders by doing the right clinical development for each of the assets that we have in our hand.","At the same time, you may have seen, from 2014 to today, is that we are in the trend of improving ratios in the P&L where the growth of the top line has been not every single quarter, but on \u2013 if you look at it on a cumulative fourth quarter in a row, that margin has been improving over time. And that's why we're where we're today, the P&L has the shape that it has to today. So, that's something we will continue to look for, but it may include quarters where investment will increase because some of the assets that we have are requiring an increased investment at some point.","So, overall, the way we have been sort of looking at this is, certainly, growth of the top line is driving our ability to invest in R&D and they are the two components to create value that will be sustainable for the long term for Incyte.","Operator","Our next question is from Vikram Purohit of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Vikram Purohit","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. So, I wanted to go back to long-term Jakafi and the tail on that franchise. And I had two questions on Jakafi lifecycle extension program. So, I believe earlier you'd alluded to possibly getting some extended release data in 2020. So, I just wanted to see what the status of that program was, if it's in the clinic yet or not?","And then,. secondly, I believe the last time we saw some Jakafi combination data was at ASH last year in combination with the PI3K molecule. So, I just wanted to see when further data from that combination could be available as well as from other combinations like pem and itacitinib in the MF setting. Thanks.","Steven Stein","Vikram, hi. It's Steven. So, thank you for your question related to ruxolitinib lifecycle management, which we view as something for ruxolitinib itself as well as for myeloproliferative neoplasms in general. There are three pillars to the program and you mentioned all of them.","So, firstly, in terms of formulation work, which you brought up, that's been ongoing this year. It involves an extended release approach in terms of formulation and bioavailability and bioequivalence work. That is underway. It's been going well. As you just said, complete in 2020 at some point. And then, we'll use it to have regulatory discussions probably through the middle of 2021.","We'll find an appropriate meeting to present that. But I'll remind you that we actually presented some ruxolitinib XR data in 2011 with the 25 milligram XR tablet. So, we have already and that work is ongoing and progressing well.","In terms of the second pillar, combinations, we are running, as you said, the PI3-kinase delta combination. That's the most mature of them. We also have a rux plus pim combination and a rux plus itacitinib combination ongoing.","We'll have ourselves \u2013 data inhouse to look at ourselves with rux plus delta approximately end of this year and we'll find an appropriate meeting to present it at in 2020 and make decisions \u2013 go-forward decisions or not in either first or second line on myelofibrosis when we look at the completeness of the data. We'll also \u2013 should have enough data with pim and itacitinib also to present in 2020 at an appropriate meeting.","And then, the third pillar, and very important, is new targets to look at in MF and PV in collaborations with academia and different vendors, including epigenetic screen, to look if there are any new targets there and we haven't announced anything publicly yet. But that's a very, very active endeavor as well.","Vikram Purohit","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from George Farmer of BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","George Farmer","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. I was wondering if you could comment a bit on pemigatinib and how you believe this molecule differentiates from other FGFR inhibitors?","Steven Stein","So, it's Steven. I'll go first. Dash may want to add something to it. We're in FGFR1, 2, 3 specific inhibitor. We know the PK and PD effects of this compound really well. We've done both intermittent dosing as well as continuous dosing. And we've got a very good PD marker, pharmacodynamic marker in hypophosphatemia. So, we can dose to that and, as I said earlier, manage appropriately.","All compounds, obviously, chemically are different. Obviously, the only approved FGFR inhibitor currently is itacitinib, the Janssen compound, and that does hit FGFR 4 as well and may explain some of the difference in safety profile that we see. But we'll wait for the full data sets to bear that out. ","As regards the other compounds, I don't know enough to comment on. I don't know if Dash wants to add anything.","Dashyant Dhanak","Yeah. I think you covered the major points there, Steven. We feel that pemigatinib is probably the most selective FGFR inhibitor out there. We're focused on FGFR 1, 2 and 3. We don't really touch the other isozymes. It varies in biochemical assays or cellular assays, et cetera. We have what we think is a great PK profile clinically. So, overall, we feel it's a balance of optimal selectivity for our target proteins as well as the clinical profile to sort of leverage that selectivity in an optimal way.","George Farmer","Great, that's helpful. And I know it's early days, but do you have any sense for duration of therapy in the steroid refractory acute setting with Jakafi?","Dashyant Dhanak","Well, we can only go on again the REACH1 trial and we believe, in fact, in the duration of response of 173 days that's in our label where therapy isn't changed and the patients don't come off for whatever reason. So, that's what we're going by. ","But we don't really have, from a commercial standpoint, a follow-up yet on what the true nature is, but we do know that it's successful, that patients seem to be staying on it for a long time.","As you know, in graft-versus-host disease in general, but it's particularly in acute graft-versus-host disease, physicians, bone marrow transplant docs, want to taper off drugs like steroids and even like Jakafi over a period of time, but just so they can do it safely and make sure they fully manage the effects of GVHD before they do so.","George Farmer","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question is from Mara Goldstein of Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Mara Goldstein","Great. Thank you very much for taking the question. Just on a couple of questions, one is on the promotional sensitivity on Jakafi and the PV indication, you mentioned that you thought that that category could get 50% penetrated. So, I'm wondering where the resistance is among the prescribing community. And is that something that is subject to also greater promotion?","And then, just secondarily, if you could update us on the status of the commercial organization for pemigatinib as you have NDA filed for cholangiocarcinoma?","Barry Flannelly","Sure. So, Jakafi is actually promotionally sensitive across all indications. It's both MS and PV can sometimes \u2013 most of our treating physicians and healthcare professionals don't see these patients that often. Sometimes, they're often worried about some of their other patients that might have lung cancer or pancreatic cancer. So, they don't pay enough attention to the symptoms, in fact, that these patients are experiencing and other indicators that their disease might be getting worse.","So, we have oncology clinical nurse educators. We have, obviously, our MSLs and we have our sales representatives that are continuing to try to educate healthcare professionals that they need to look more closely at these patients, particularly PV patients who are suffering and that's one of the reasons we do our educational campaign, obviously, to encourage patients themselves to go out and, in fact, advocate for themselves if they don't feel like they're getting the appropriate treatment.","Your second question was \u2013 oh, the commercial footprint for pemigatinib. So, we do plan, in fact, to add a few more people in 2020 to get ready for the pemigatinib launch. So, we're going to keep the full amount of current FTEs against Jakafi for MF and PV. We're going to increase slightly the number of FTEs that we have that are targeting graft-versus-host disease in bone marrow transplant centers and then a few FTEs that will be concentrated on pemigatinib. We also have a couple of oncology clinical nurse educators and, obviously, our market accessing people that are, in fact, fully ready for and fully trained on pemigatinib and cholangiocarcinoma for the launch in 2020.","Operator","Our final question is from Christopher Marai of Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead.","Christopher Marai","Good morning. Thank you for taking the question. Just maybe touching up some of the ruxo lifecycle management plans, if I recall, previously, Incyte had a BET inhibitor in the pipeline or have been looking at that target. And [indiscernible], there was some great data for [indiscernible] in myelofibrosis and had the potential to potentially work in a second line, but also maybe augment [indiscernible] in first line myelofibrosis. And I was wondering if perhaps you could comment on your [indiscernible] how you might be looking at that particular target? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Yeah, Christopher. Hi, it's Steven. So, I'll just remind you, we ourselves had a BET BRD program. So, obviously, we had pre-clinical data that showed that rux plus that target had enhanced or potentially enhanced efficacy in myelofibrosis and we ran into toxicity in terms of \u2013 a non-target toxicity in terms of thrombocytopenia and currently put ourselves the program on clinical hold with the regulators. You alluded to a competitor, BET BRD program which showed, you're right, some interesting data and have an abstract in for future medical meeting that they may show more and we'll follow that closely. We are interested in anything that enhances rux activity and we'll keep looking across that. Our own programs are there for us to use should we need to resurrect them.","Christopher Marai","Okay. [Technical Difficulty] the toxicities I think it sounds like the competitor had, but, as you noted, that was something you're still investigating. Any improvement on the therapeutic index there? Maybe any mechanistic reason why if you think yours might be different from the competitors? Thank you.","Steven Stein","Yeah. So, I won't address them directly, but it's known that that BRD inhibitors have on-target thrombocytopenia that can be profound. So, you have to read the therapeutic ratio carefully in terms of potentially dosing to get there. I can't speak to the competitor compound there.","Operator","There are no additional questions at this time. I'd like to turn the call back over to Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot for closing remarks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Okay. Thank you.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  (Operator instructions.)  As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Pamela Murphy, Vice President of Investor Relations and Communications.  Thank you; you may begin.","Pamela Murphy","Good morning and welcome to Incyte\u2019s Q3 2012 conference call.  It\u2019s been a challenging week for many and we appreciate your participation this morning.  ","On the call today are Paul Friedman, Incyte\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Dave Hastings, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; Rich Levy, Executive Vice President and Chief Drug Development and Medical Officer; and the newest member of the Incyte team, Jim Daly, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer.","Dave will begin with a review of our Q3 financial results and Paul will follow with additional comments regarding the ongoing launch of Jakafi and provide an update on our lead clinical program.  Then Jim, who just started here last week, is going to share a few of his key reasons for joining Incyte.  We\u2019ll then open up the call for Q&A.","Before beginning, we\u2019d like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations for the launch and commercialization of Jakafi, our product revenue guidance as well as our development plans.  These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our Form 10(q) for the quarter ended June 30th, 2012, and from time to time on our other SEC documents.  Dave?","Dave Hastings","Thanks, Pam, good morning everybody.  I\u2019ll start this morning with product revenue, which for the three months ended September 30th, 2012, was $43.7 million.  As expected, this quarter we transitioned to the sell-in method from the sell-through method for revenue recognition.  This means that we are now recognizing revenue when our product is received by the specialty pharmacy.  As a result of this transition, included in net product revenue for the quarter is $9 million of previously deferred revenue from products shipped to our specialty pharmacy customers prior to June 30th, 2012.","In our press release this morning, for comparative purposes we\u2019ve provided a table showing Q3 as if we were still using the sell-through method which as you know is based on dispenses to patients.  As that table shows, using the sell-through method our Q3 net product revenue would have been $34.5 million compared to $29.7 million in Q2.  This 16% sequential growth in Jakafi dispensed to patients in Q3 supports our expectation of a steady and consistent launch.  Our net product revenues for the nine months ended September 30, 2012, were $92.7 million and we have tightened our guidance for 2012 to a range of $130 million to $135 million, which represents the upper end of the guidance we provided last quarter.  ","Our gross-to-net adjustment for product revenue recognized for Q3 was approximately $3.4 million or about 7.3%.  As a reminder, this percentage will vary from quarter to quarter depending on our (inaudible) but it has been relatively consistent over the past few quarters.  Our gross-to-net adjustment includes the following: fees to our specialty pharmacies, rebates to governmental payers, our share of the doughnut hole for Medicare Part B patients, copay assistance to eligible privately-insured patients, and any product returns.","Our cost of goods sold was immaterial as our initial finished goods inventory was previously expensed as R&D prior to FDA approval.  And in terms of operating expenses, both R&D and SG&A were within our expectations.  In terms of cash we ended the quarter in a strong position with $244 million in cash and investments; that excludes $9.5 million in restricted cash held in escrow for interest payments through October, 2012, on our 4.75% convertible senior notes.","To conclude, with the Jakafi launch going well and our expectation of future milestone royalty payments from our strategic partners, we are in a strong financial position.  So with that, Paul, I\u2019ll turn the call over to you.","Paul Friedman","Okay, thank you.  As Dave said we are seeing steady and consistent growth as evidenced by the 16% sequential increase in underlying demand, and we\u2019re building a strong foundation for long-term growth of Jakafi.  ","We saw a consistent rate of new patients initiating Jakafi during Q2 and Q3, and here it\u2019s important to note that new patients are generated from both new prescribers as well as from existing prescribers who continue to treat an increasing number of patients.  And in that regard, approximately 30% of our target customers are now prescribed Jakafi.  Overall, this means that we\u2019re growing the base of prescriber experience with Jakafi and increasing the depth of experience which reflects physicians\u2019 desire to identify more patients within their practices who are appropriate for Jakafi treatment.  ","And we continue to be focused on improving persistency for patients who initiate treatment with Jakafi.  As we discussed on the Q2 call, the primary reasons for patients either coming off therapy or being placed on a dose hold include thrombocytopenia, anemia, and death.  The data suggests we are starting to see improvement in persistency which reflect two ongoing developments.  First, we\u2019re seeing a gradual shift to less-advanced patients taking Jakafi; and second, physicians are becoming better informed on how to manage Jakafi dose titration through increased experience and an expanded educational campaign on what to expect when initiating and maintaining use of Jakafi over time.","Our goal is to reach every new patient and prescriber to ensure that they can achieve the best possible outcome with Jakafi.  One important message is to reinforce proactive dose modifications by physicians consistent with Jakafi\u2019s label since we\u2019ve seen in our pharmacy data that physicians who modify dosing have better persistency rates than those that don\u2019t.  Educating physicians on the appropriate use of Jakafi is the primary focus of our field force.  As part of our educational efforts we\u2019ve also focused on helping physicians identify patients who can restart Jakafi, and we\u2019ve seen an increasing number of patients who were taken off therapy restart Jakafi over the past few months.  ","In addition to these factors, our regulatory team has been focused on working with FDA to help ensure that the label for Jakafi optimally reflects current information available from clinical studies of Jakafi for as broad a group of patients suffering from Myelofibrosis as possible.  And you\u2019ll recall because we didn\u2019t initially include patients with platelet counts less than 100,000 in our Phase III trials, we initiated a separate study in these patients to find appropriate dosing.  Interim results from this study presented at ASCO and EHA show that the majority of patients who started at a dose of 5mg twice a day and optimized their dose to 10mg twice daily or higher experienced reductions in spleen size and improvements in Myelofibrosis-related symptoms.","We\u2019re confident that we can continue to translate the scientific advancement that Jakafi represents into tangible patient benefits and long-term growth.  Some of these advancements will be highlighted at the upcoming ASH meeting where we and our partner Novartis have twelve presentations, six of which will be oral.  Two of the oral presentations describe the long-term results from both COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II,  While these abstracts aren\u2019t yet available and I can\u2019t be specific in advance of the presentations, these results from COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II build on the previously disclosed data suggesting that Jakafi may provide an overall survival advantage to patients who initiate therapy.","Now I\u2019m going to briefly discuss some of the other programs in our pipeline, starting with the further clinical development of Jakafi.  The RESPONSE trial in polycythemia vera in partnership with Novartis is on track to complete enrollment around year-end, with a supplemental NDA submission expected in 2014.  The FDA has granted fast-track designation for PV, specifically for the treatment of patients who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea.","The second study in PV patients called RELIEF, evaluating the symptomatic benefit, is ongoing.  The study is not required for FDA approval but we do intend to submit results to support labeling claims on symptomatic benefit on PV in our initial FDA application for the treatment of patients with PV in 2014.","The Phase II trial of Jakafi in pancreatic cancer is on track to complete enrollment by the end of the year, and we anticipate final results of this double-blind study by the second half of 2013.","Now, for Baricitinib, our JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor partnered with Lilly, we look forward to the presentation at ACR later this month of six-month data from the Phase IIb trial in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.  Screening has begun for the Phase III clinical program in RA.  Lilly is also conducting Phase II trials of Baricitinib in psoriasis and in diabetic nephropathy.  We look forward to updating you further on the plans for Baricitinib together with our partner Lilly at a meeting for the analyst community at ACR.","Our earlier-stage oncology programs for c-MET and Indoleamine Dioxygenase or IDO are progressing and we can address any questions you might have about them during Q&A; and we have other ongoing clinical development programs in oncology and inflammation.  For example, with regard to our compound INCYTE 39110 we posted clinical trials in Myelofibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis to www.clinicaltrials.gov.","Before beginning Q&A I\u2019d like to welcome Jim Daly who has assumed responsibility for our commercial organization, including sales, marketing, and business development.  Jim has extensive industry experience and has successfully launched and commercialized multiple oncology products.  He joins us from Amgen where he most recently served as Senior Vice President of North America Commercial Operations.  We at Incyte feel very fortunate to have attracted someone of Jim\u2019s caliber and experience.  Jim?","Jim Daly","Thank you very much, Paul, and good morning everyone.  I am really excited to be a part of this Incyte team.  As you can imagine, I did my homework before joining, and based upon the learnings I\u2019m convinced that Jakafi represents an extraordinary opportunity to make a meaningful difference for patients with Myelofibrosis.  ","Not only is it first-in-class and the only FDA-approved treatment for a true unmet need, Jakafi simply provides remarkable clinical efficacy for patients.  That said, there are always challenges in educating physicians and patients on the optimal initiation and maintenance of most truly novel therapies; and in my past experience with GSK and Amgen in launching such products in oncology and other specialty areas, when the efficacy benefits are strikingly perceptible to patients and physicians most other issues are highly, highly, highly manageable.","In my short time at Incyte I have been greatly impressed by the level of talent and energy within the organization and the deep commitment to make a positive impact for patients.  I look forward to working with my colleagues to continue to grow Jakafi and to develop and commercialize our future products.  Back to Paul.","Paul Friedman","Thanks, Jim, and welcome to the team.  We look forward to your contributions to our continued success.  And with that, Operator, let\u2019s open the call for Q&A please.","","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  (Operator instructions.)   Our first question comes from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies & Company.  Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Just wanted to see if you could provide a little bit more detail on things like the discontinuation rates of persistency that you\u2019re talking about; and also compliance rates.  On a quarter-over-quarter basis, how do those look?  Are we starting to see improvements in either discontinuation or compliance?","Jim Daly","Hi Thomas, this is Jim.  Thanks for your question.  Let me give you just a really brief preamble and then we\u2019ll get right to the heart of your question.  First, I just wanted to reinforce that we are fully committed to sharing with your our best understanding of what\u2019s going on with the Jakafi launch.  From our perspective, dispenses to patients or what we\u2019re referring to as \u201csell-through,\u201d that is our best and most reliable measure of true underlying demand, and that\u2019s why we highlighted it so prominently in the press release, in the black box there.  And that trend underpins our guidance of $130 million to $135 million for this year.","Now with respect to secondary drivers of demand, such as persistency or what you refer to as compliance rates, or new patient starts, at this point we really don\u2019t think it\u2019s constructive to get into specific numbers at a very detailed level because we think it could be potentially misleading without providing the appropriate context and caveats to go with these numbers.  For instance, as you talk about persistency, there really isn\u2019t a single persistency number; it\u2019s really a curve over time in which you have to follow various cohorts of patients since the month in which they were initiated on therapy.  ","And we\u2019re doing that very diligently, but as you can imagine at the end of six months or nine months, some of those cohorts become increasingly small.  It\u2019s also compounded by the fact that we have begun to see an increase in the number of patients who are restarting therapy, which is also a very important consideration in the dynamic.","Having said that, we\u2019re more than open to provide you with as much directional, qualitative feedback as we can on issues like persistency and new patient starts.  So with respect to the persistency, in direct response to your question, Thomas, over the last two to three months we are seeing an improvement in the one-month persistency in patients.  And as Paul indicated in the formal remarks, that\u2019s not unexpected.  We\u2019re seeing a shift to a healthier patient population as measured by their baseline thrombocytopenia and\/or anemia, and we\u2019re also seeing physicians who are becoming much more facile with the dose titration.  ","I hope that answers your question, Thomas.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","It does.  Maybe just to follow up and then I\u2019ll jump back in the queue:  I guess I\u2019m having a little bit of a hard time reconciling\u2026  If you had about the same number of new patient starts I would actually be calculating that the sales should have been higher than what you reported given the gross-to-net.  And so the kind of missing factors here are the persistence and the compliance, but you\u2019re saying that directionally those numbers improved on a quarter-over-quarter basis?","Jim Daly","Let me qualify that a little bit more for you, Thomas.  First, we\u2019re very pleased with the rate of new patient adds.  As Paul indicated again in the formal remarks, we\u2019ve seen a consistent number of patients added month-on-month in Q3 relative to Q2.  So that\u2019s encouraging.  Physicians are having very little difficulty identifying new patients who are appropriate for Jakafi treatment.  Now, just assuming that persistency is a plug, which you\u2019re going to back in to persistency \u2013 that is the single most important lever from our perspective going forward in order to increase overall demand.  And we\u2019re focused on that very diligently and we are seeing early indications of improvement, but again, I think it\u2019s too early to try and quantify those trends.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Roden with UBS.  Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks for taking my question.  Congrats to Jim and to the company for finding each other \u2013 it seems like a good fit.  So maybe, Jim, a question for you.  We appreciate your take from an outsider\u2019s perspective on the organization, but I\u2019d be curious to understand what you like about the operations that you see and where you see opportunities to do things a little bit differently.  How would you put your stamp on the organization?","Jim Daly","Hi, Matt.  First of all, Matt ,thanks very much for the question, and I fully agree with you that it really is a match made in heaven.  And I\u2019m thrilled to be here, both for the nature of the business opportunity but also because of the culture that I\u2019ve found in the past couple weeks.  In terms of what\u2019s most important to me in terms of adding value to the organization, three things: Jakafi, Jakafi, Jakafi.  ","We really feel a sense of urgency to make sure that this product is made available to the patients who will experience profound benefit.  So I\u2019m looking forward to working very closely with the sales and marketing organization, spending a lot of time out in the field with our representatives and with key customers to get a firsthand understanding of the market, a firsthand appreciation for the opportunities as well as the barriers; and making sure that we\u2019re doing everything we can to optimize successful trial so that we get the right dose, the right patient with the right expectation, and thereby earn the right to come back to physicians and ask them to put more patients on the product.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And then just one follow-up if I may for Paul or Rich, I\u2019m intrigued by the title in the ASH abstracts here on long-term follow up, because when we talk to community oncologists anecdotally what they say is that longer-term follow up on survival is important for expanding utilization into less severe patients.  So maybe, guys, just to manage our expectations a little bit, do you think that the data forthcoming are going to be supportive of increased use or not supportive?  How should we think about that?","Paul Friedman","Well, we would probably not have highlighted both COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II in that way if the data was in our opinion not going to be supportive of a survival benefit in both studies.  But what would you say, Rich?  We\u2019re kind of limited because of the abstracts haven\u2019t come out yet.","Rich Levy","I think the abstracts are scheduled to come out on November 5th so it\u2019s a short period of time before the level of clarity from the abstracts themselves and then maybe a little bit more details at the actual presentations.  But we really look forward to that data because we totally agree that the more people are convinced that there is a survival advantage the more likely they will not only start less severe patients but the harder they will work to titrate the doses to keep patients on drug.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Okay, thanks for your perspective.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter with Canaccord Genuity.  Please proceed with your question.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Thanks for taking my questions.  Just in terms of the education to restart Jakafi, I\u2019m just wondering if you can remind us the reasons for why patients drop off and then which of the patients who dropped off would be candidates to restart therapy?  And then you also mentioned about 30% of your target physicians now prescribe Jakafi \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to understand what\u2019s playing out with the other 70% as to why they\u2019re not prescribing yet.  Thank you.","Paul Friedman","Okay, I\u2019ll start and then pass the baton to Jim.  The major reasons for a dose hold: either your platelet counts go too low or your red count goes lower than the physician or the patient is comfortable with.  You can then have a dose hold which is what we did in the clinical studies until the counts rebound, and then you start again at a lower dose and you work up to an optimal dose.  ","It\u2019s a joint effort between the patient and the physician to titrate to a proper dose.  If you work at it, the vast majority of patients can find a tolerable and very effective dose.  And as we\u2019ve gone out and provided further education to physicians, there is a greater and greater willingness \u2013 as evidenced by the numbers \u2013 to restart patients that they have stopped for cytopenia.  And we\u2019re anticipating that over time that number will continue to increase.  Jim?","Jim Daly","Paul, I think from a sales force perspective, our responsibility is to remind physicians that this is not a one-size-fits-all product and that the benefits of titrating patients to the optimal dose are certainly worth the upfront investment of time on the part of physicians and patients.  So I think that\u2019s a fairly straightforward exercise and we\u2019re committed to implementing it extremely well.","Now, to the second part of your question which is a third of our prescribing audience, of our target audience have prescribed Jakafi \u2013 what\u2019s going on with the others?  Our market research indicates that the single most common reason for not having prescribed the product is they simply haven\u2019t encountered an appropriate patient yet.  So we\u2019re confident that with continued effort we\u2019ll be able to increase their adoption of Jakafi.  Intent to prescribe it is extremely high.  When we talk to these physicians and ask them about their intent to prescribe going forward, that\u2019s a very encouraging metric for us.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Great.  If I could just follow up on the patients that discontinued and you\u2019re trying to get to restart, is there a pool of patients that you don\u2019t see capable of restarting, I mean apart from patients that have stopped treatment due to death?  Is there any other group?","Rich Levy","This is Rich.  You know, it\u2019s hard to say in every single case but for the most part why patients have stopped is because they have not necessarily titrated to the right dose.  And so I think the key is to educate those physicians as to the data that we now have suggesting, for example, the 10 mg BID dose is a very effective dose that doesn\u2019t cause cytopenias for the vast majority of patients; and to try to get back to those sorts of things.  But I mean to speak to every single patient without knowing the details, I can\u2019t be sure.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan Chase.  Please proceed with your question.","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Great, good morning to all and thanks for taking the questions.  I have two of them for you.  I wanted to follow up first on the survival question because we\u2019re also finding that docs are largely unaware of the initial survival data presented at ASH or what was published in Blood which is what\u2019s preventing them from putting their less symptomatic patients on therapy.  So do you expect you can ultimately try to get this longer-term follow-up data that\u2019s to be presented at ASH added to the product\u2019s label?  And then the second question is another one on persistency, and you mentioned that it\u2019s improving partly because physicians have become better informed on implementing dose titration.  Can you just talk a little bit about the educational efforts that are necessary there and how complicated this titration is?  Thanks.","Rich Levy","This is Rich.  So I think part of the reason that the message may not have gotten through as well as we would have ideally hoped in the past around survival is that there were naysayers out there who were saying \u201cWell, you only have an advantage over placebo in COMFORT-I but you don\u2019t have an advantage over the vast available therapy in terms of survival in COMFORT-II.\u201d  ","And so with people speaking against this at the same time that people were speaking for it, I think the message got diluted.  I think that there\u2019s a reasonable chance that if the COMFORT-II data were to show a survival difference that there would be much more of a consensus among thought leaders that this really is true, and that will then get down to the level of the community physician who is treating the majority of these patients.","With respect to adding this to labeling, I think that\u2019s still going to be very difficult given that the studies really weren\u2019t planned.  We didn\u2019t think that we had the opportunity within these relatively small, short-term studies during the control period to be able to demonstrate this.  And so at some point we will provide the data to FDA in a package and let them evaluate it, but I think the chances that this would actually lead to a true labeling claim at this point are small.  ","And I will point out that there\u2019s histories of drugs that have done very well based on the type of data that gets out into the literature on survival without actually getting the claim.  Was there a second part to your question that I missed?","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Just on the persistency, the education around the dose titration.","Rich Levy","The titration\u2026 Our labeling does indicate that titration is an appropriate approach but doesn\u2019t get into a great deal of specifics other than titrating for thrombocytopenia.  And so we think it\u2019s also important for those who are more concerned about dropping hemoglobin levels to know what they can do in the shorter term to get those hemoglobin levels up without the necessity for holding dose or transfusing.  So we have data out there in the scientific community; we continue to talk about that at scientific exchanges and in response to requests for information, but the sales force can actually go out and talk quite a bit about the need for titration which is on-label information.","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.  Please proceed with your question.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah, thanks very much.  I wanted to go back to the discontinuation question but ask it a little bit differently.  It sounds like there\u2019s two basic discontinuations, right, where you have patients who are very ill and drop off because they\u2019re so sick and they\u2019re dying; but then you have this other cohort of patients who are discontinuing because physicians just don\u2019t know how to titrate properly.  And just qualitatively, if you can give us a sense of is that kind of half and half or is it predominantly one versus the other?  And then I also wanted to ask Jim, since you\u2019re here and you had it sounds like some chance to really dig in here, what do you think needs to be done differently?  If you can kind of speak to getting these patients more urgently on drug, what other programs or messaging needs to be done to be more effective in the sales force?  Thanks.","Paul Friedman","Okay, so I\u2019ll start and then Jim can answer the second part of the question or elaborate on the first part as well.  Early on, as we\u2019ve said on multiple occasions the patient mix was much more heavily weighted toward patients with platelet counts less than 100,000.  They also were early on being dosed with 15 mgs and 20 mgs twice a day, which was too high a dose for people with less than 100,000 platelets.","So there are two things that have happened with respect to the overall population.  One is the week-over-week mix of patients with platelet counts below 100,000 versus those above 100,000 now has significantly fewer patients who are coming in below 100,000.  But beyond that, the message that we\u2019ve taken out into the field from our presentations at ASCO and EHA as to how to dose people who come on Jakafi with an initial platelet count of less than 100,000 is getting out, because we\u2019re finding in discussions with physicians who start such patients that they are now beginning the patients almost always \u2013 certainly in a majority of cases \u2013 at 5mgs BID and working their way up to 10 mgs.  ","So you have a change in the percentage of the really fragile patients in the mix every week, and for those fragile patients, they are being dosed more appropriately with a lower starting dose.  So in both instances what you would predict and what we are beginning to see are improvements in persistency.  Jim?","Jim Daly","Rachel, to your question about the adjustments we would make going forward, let me first say that I have been extremely impressed by the professionalism and the sophistication of the launch plan for Jakafi as well as the execution.  I think the team has done a first-class job in preparing this product for launch and executing extremely well in the first nearly year after launch.","As I look at the biographies of our sales force, we\u2019ve been very fortunate to recruit the brightest and the best people with deep, deep oncology experience.  So beyond that, I think it\u2019s premature to say what are the changes that we would be looking at making other than the fact that I have never seen a launch where you haven\u2019t had three months, six months after launch to go back and make some adjustments in terms of your key launch assumptions.  There is always a gap between theory and reality.  You go back, you make the adjustments, you fine tune the plan and you go forward, and I think we\u2019re in the process of doing that right now.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great.  And then just one quick follow up for Paul or Rich: on your JAK1 program, I\u2019m just curious if you have any more comments in regards to inflammation versus Myelofibrosis.  I would expect something with very limited JAK2 selectivity to not work in MF but clearly you feel differently because you\u2019re running a study there, so what are appropriate expectations in that setting?  Thanks.","Rich Levy","So first of all, 39110, a JAK inhibitor with a different profile than ruxolitinib \u2013 we\u2019re putting it into studies for which we already have data from our JAK1\/JAK2 programs to be able to compare how that profile differs in diseases that we understand, and in where we can get data in a relatively short period of time.  And those results will then determine whether or not we proceed further with those studies or go into different types of indications.  And beyond that, in the absence of data I don\u2019t really have further comments.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen and Company.  Please proceed with your question.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks for taking my questions.  Just first I\u2019d like to confirm or hope to confirm that you\u2019ve all weathered Hurricane Sandy well enough down there and there haven\u2019t been any supply chain disruptions of any sort?","Paul Friedman","No Eric, we\u2019re fine.  Thanks for asking.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Great.  Maybe a follow-up to Jim\u2019s statement: he mentioned that he\u2019s fully committed to sharing with us all aspects of Jakafi\u2019s launch that you can.  Does that mean that he has a different view towards unblocking the third party prescription data?","Jim Daly","Eric, most likely not.  I mean we\u2019re being 100% transparent in terms of dispenses to patients and we think that really is the key metric going forward.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay, and then maybe a follow up for Paul.  It\u2019s a little unclear to me on what impact you think this FDA label change might have that you sought in terms of low platelet count patients.  I now you filed for getting the new dosing data on the label, but it also sounded to me like you think you might have everything you need already.  So I guess the question would be one, what timing should we look forward to in terms of an FDA labeling update; and two, is this critical or as you\u2019ve kind of insinuated, do you pretty much have what you need to make headway with these low platelet count patients today?","Paul Friedman","Well, I think that\u2019s good insight into what I was saying because we\u2019ve made a lot of inroads into educating appropriately.  I\u2019ll let Rich answer about the label.  I think it\u2019s always better to ultimately have something in the label but in the meantime we\u2019ve made great strides in getting these patients on the right dose.","Rich Levy","Yeah, so I\u2019ll just reiterate that I think it is better to have it in the label.  It creates more opportunities to reach physicians who don\u2019t take part in educational exercises, don\u2019t ask additional questions, that sort of thing.  In terms of the timing, we submitted it in August and we\u2019re still waiting for a definitive [TOFA].  FDA has indicated in the past that they would continue to work with us to do this as soon as reasonably possible.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities.  Please proceed with your question.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, thanks very much for taking my question, and Jim, welcome to the team.  I want to shift gears to Baricitinib.  With the Phase III\u2019s now getting going [and then posting into] clinical trials, I was wondering if you can give a little bit more detail about the designs overall ,the powering of the studies, really what you\u2019re aiming to do maybe similarly versus differently from other RA programs?  Might there be more studies that we should be looking for and if you can give us maybe any sense of the timelines there?  Thanks.","Rich Levy","So I really can\u2019t get into specifics until the analysts meeting, the joint analysts meeting that will take place at ACR.  I think those invitations have gone out; I can\u2019t remember the exact day but it\u2019s the evening of the actual presentation of the Phase II study.  Just in general terms I would say that the studies will cover a range of patients, from those that are [Team F] for biologic experienced to [DMR] to methotrexate experienced to na\u00efve patients with the attempt to get a broad label in RA.","I\u2019d also say that as we said before that certainly the program was tweaked based on the findings at the advisory committee for tofacitinib, particularly around their findings around structure to make sure that we had adequately powered studies there.  And I think the nuances are key and hopefully we\u2019ll have more information around that and an opportunity to ask more detailed questions around this.  And Pam just showed me that that date is November 13th. ","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Great, and then maybe just a quick follow-up.  Can you speak to the role of JAK inhibitors in diabetic nephropathy, what you see as the market opportunity there and maybe if there are any differences in the economics within the partnership for that indication?  Thanks.","Rich Levy","Sure.  Paul, should I take that?  So first of all, it\u2019s quite clear that there is inflammation in the kidney and that there is elevated JAK levels in the kidney in diabetic nephropathy, and so a drug that can treat this potentially can have real beneficial effects in terms of maintaining renal function in patients with diabetic nephropathy.  And if that actually works then that is a massive opportunity that makes things like RA pale in comparison according to the information that we\u2019ve been given from Lilly, which I can\u2019t get into any more detail than that.","In terms of the economics, the deals are the same regardless of what we do which is we get to see Phase II data before we have to make a buy-in decision.  They\u2019re doing this trial now which I believe is posted on www.clinicaltrials.gov, and we will see results from that study before we decide whether we\u2019re going to pay 30% of the going forward costs for that study.  And so that\u2019s one of the reasons we did the deal with Lilly, is because we get to pick and choose where we put our money based on actual proof of concept results.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Friedman with Morgan Stanley.  Please proceed with your question.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks for taking the questions; just two quick ones.  Number one is in terms of the patient adds this quarter, can you give some sense of the breakdown of what were truly new to drug patients versus patients who had dropped off previously and restarted?  And then the second question is if you can just describe maybe what the difference is between what the FDA\u2019s threshold is for recognizing data and what you think the clinical community has a threshold for; if you think that these survival data could potentially have a clinical impact but not necessarily meet the threshold of either quality or whatever for the FDA to put it on a label?","Jim Daly","Hi David, this is Jim.  David, I don\u2019t want to get into a quantitative description of the components of total patients in the past quarter.  I think it\u2019s fair to say that the bulk of the patients in the past quarter were repeat patients.  We had a fairly significant proportion that were new and the smallest proportion would have been restarted patients.","Rich Levy","So in terms of survival data in the package insert, I mean the traditional approach is you design a study or studies for survival.  You define exactly when you\u2019re going to look at the data and [spend your] alpha, so to speak; so if you do more than one analysis you have to describe in advance \u201chow I\u2019m going to spend\u2026\u201d  Let\u2019s say you start out with a target, a P value of .05 \u2013 if you look more than one time you have to distribute that.","In this case we did not envision that within a six-month trial for COMFORT-I or within a one-year trial for COMFORT-II, with allowance for crossovers \u2013 even within those studies for patients that were doing poorly \u2013 that we really had any chance of showing survival.  And so in terms of alpha spend, so to speak, we haven\u2019t left alpha to continue to spend for these new analyses and I think it\u2019s for that reason that there\u2019s a low likelihood that FDA would say \u201cOkay, you\u2019ve demonstrated a survival benefit.\u201d","But if you consider the hurdles that we were up against here \u2013 designing studies that were too small ,we thought were too small for survival; allowing for crossover, which will tend to make things equal, not different over time; and also the fact that within COMFORT-II there were patients who were lost to follow-up and we were never able to find out if they were alive or dead early on because the protocol didn\u2019t allow those patients to be followed, and the clear majority of those patients were patients who were on [back], who we could never say die sooner \u2013 all of those were hurdles.  And despite that, we\u2019re seeing the data that we haven\u2019t actually shown you yet updated, but as you can obviously surmise positive data despite that.","And I think as we get all of those things across to the community, including that it\u2019s better than the best available therapy, I think that it will have a significant impact but perhaps not as great as if it were in the label and we could actively promote it.  And that\u2019s just it\u2019s better than where we were, that\u2019s for sure.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks.  And just to be clear on the first question answered, you said the majority are new to drug or the majority are restarts?","Jim Daly","If you take a look at our total base of patients in Q3 the majority are repeat patients.  There is a significant component that are new and finally there\u2019s a smaller component which is patients which are restarting the therapy.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.  Please proceed with your question.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks, I had a couple of them.  First, just starting off with the severely ill patients which you\u2019ve previously identified as a source of increased rate of dropouts this year versus potentially next year, can you just share with us where we are in the process of potentially seeing these patients, whether they\u2019re still on therapy or if a vast majority of them are close to coming off therapy?  And then I had a few follow-ons.","Paul Friedman","Sure.  Certainly some of them are on therapy and we\u2019re hoping that now that they\u2019ve been titrated to appropriate doses that they\u2019ll be able to stay on for extended periods of time.  So it\u2019s kind of a spectrum that again, where I can\u2019t give you a specific number.  Jim, do you want to add anything to that?","Jim Daly","No, I agree with that.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay.  And then second on the Baricitinib Phase III program in RA, just to get into the comments you made related to the [TOFA] panel, should we assume the size of the Phase III trial is comparative to tofacitinib or is it larger?","Rich Levy","I think what I was implying is that the structure study is now powered based on their very slow rate of progression in the control group, and so that study may be larger.  But I\u2019m not commenting on the overall size of the program including all the other studies.  I think you\u2019ll get a much better sense of that when Lilly talks about it, and we\u2019ll be there on November 13th.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay.  And just the last question was just on the survival data.  Is there any sense of urgency, either at Incyte or Novartis, to run a study to confirm the overall survival benefit prospectively on the study and try to get that on the label?","Rich Levy","It would be extraordinarily hard to do that these days.  You know, I think with the data out there that there is almost certainly a survival benefit.  To randomize patients and not let them cross over would be perhaps unethical; my view is that it would be, but also impractical.  So it\u2019s kind of a double-edged sword, but we\u2019re happy to see that even within studies that would have a very difficult time demonstrating this that it really would be in my mind unethical to randomize patients to have to stay on therapy other than ruxolitinib.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","That\u2019s a challenge I should think that\u2019s true for you as well as your competitors.","Rich Levy","Absolutely.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Josh Schimmer with Lazard Capital Markets.  Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Schimmer \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Hey, thanks for taking the question.  I guess coming back to diabetic nephropathy, it might be a large commercial opportunity but I\u2019m wondering why this indication would be prioritized given that the development path to maybe even prospects for success seem rather cloudy at least in comparison to other Phase II inflammatory indications you could have chosen to advance further or faster.","Paul Friedman","Yes, I don\u2019t think it is to the exclusion of those other indications.  There\u2019s obviously particular interest that Lilly had in diabetes and we\u2019ve kind of, I think Rich outlined briefly the rationale; I think the Lilly people could get into it in significantly more depth if you wanted to pursue it with them, Josh.  It does not preclude studying what you\u2019re referring to as the more obvious inflammatory diseases.","Joshua Schimmer \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Any thoughts to when we might see those other Phase II indications advance or be advanced?","Paul Friedman","I think you\u2019d have to talk to Lilly about that.","Joshua Schimmer \u2013 Lazard Capital Markets","Got it, okay.  Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of [David Krempler] with Morningstar.  Please proceed with your question.","[David Krempler] \u2013 Morningstar ","Hey guys, thanks for taking the question.  Can you give an update on the payer environment?  I think last quarter you said you had pretty broad coverage but two-thirds of patients were requiring prior approval and it was causing a slight slowdown in the uptake rates?","Jim Daly","Hi, this is Jim.  Actually the reimbursement situation is remarkably positive for this product.  Right now we really don\u2019t see reimbursement as being rate limiting to putting new patients on the product.  If you want to break it down by payer we have 50% Medicare, 30% commercial and 10% will be kind of your VA, etc.  So we have a very favorable reimbursement environment right now with Jakafi.","[David Krempler] \u2013 Morningstar ","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang with Barclays.  Please proceed with your question.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays ","Morning, thanks for taking my questions.  I have one question on, can you give us a little bit more color on the breakdown between patients with high risk versus intermediate risk who are on therapy of Jakafi?  And then I have a financial question as well.  Obviously Lilly has already started to enroll the patients in October for Baricitinib.  Can you guys give us an estimated cost for the Phase III and your share?  I mean I think you have to shoulder 30% - how should we think about R&D costs in the next two, three years?  Thank you.","Dave Hastings","I\u2019ll deal with the R&D question.  Yeah, we can\u2019t get into specifics about what the investments will be over the next two or three years with Lilly.  What I can say is that they\u2019ve been thoroughly consistent in terms of the budgeting process, what those numbers look like when we first even negotiated the deal.  We would expect R&D to go higher next year primarily driven by that investment.  You\u2019ll see that increase in \u201913 and \u201914 and then start to reduce in \u201915.","Rich Levy","If I can just add to that, I think that the money that we\u2019re spending as our 30% in [RA] with Lilly is money very well spent.  The drug looks really, really good.  We\u2019re very excited about this and we can afford to do it.","Paul Friedman","With respect to your first question, we have a nice mix of intermediate II and higher-risk patients.  I don\u2019t have the breakdown in front of me here but the majority of the patients who have been put on Jakafi would be categorized as either intermediate II or high risk but we are seeing a proportion of patients in the intermediate I category which I think is encouraging.","Jim Daly","Before we close off I do want to clarify my answer to the previous question, and the question was \u201cHow does your payer environment look and what\u2019s your reimbursement mix?\u201d  So let me clarify that.  50% of our patients are commercial, and right now commercial payers are somewhat reluctant to create barriers for an orphan indication like Myelofibrosis.  30% of our patients are Medicare, and the issue there, because most of our patients there are on Part D is the doughnut hole; and we\u2019ve been very successful in helping patients navigate through the doughnut hole.  And then finally the remaining patients are a mix of VA, military, etc.  So I hope that clarifies the earlier response.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Boris Peaker with Oppenheimer.  Please proceed with your question.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer ","Hi, I have one quick clarification.  The numbers you just mentioned on Medicare versus commercial, could you clarify \u2013 is it 50% Medicare or 30% Medicare?","Jim Daly","It\u2019s 30% Medicare.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer ","30%, okay great.  And the other question is a general question: we talked about a number of data pieces that are going to be coming out that may help Jakafi in the market.  Could you comment on how long do you think it takes to communicate the details, let\u2019s say from the [ACRF starts] to the physicians; and then what your expectation is for that data in terms of time to be incorporated into actual prescribing behavior?","Jim Daly","Well, I can speak to the question in respect to oncology and hematology.  We\u2019ll have the ASH meeting in December and there are typically ASH reviews that follow immediately thereafter, and this community is very quick to pick up on new data.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer ","So can you give a quantitative time period, let\u2019s say after the ASH abstracts are available and your sales guys could start marketing the information?  Is it one quarter that you anticipate to see some impact; is it six months, a year?  Just some kind of a quantitative ballpark.","Jim Daly","I would be careful about false precision, but generally if you take a look at an ASCO meeting or an ASH meeting you will start to see a change of prescribing within one or two quarters after the meeting.  Again, it takes time.  It takes time for physicians, particularly when you\u2019re dealing with a condition like Myelofibrosis.  What\u2019s very limiting is the next time the physician happens to see an MF patient.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer ","Got it.  And my last question is, in terms of support groups there are at least two major support groups for Myelofibrosis.  Are you working or how are you working with these support groups and how do you see that helping in identifying new patients as well as maintaining current patients on drug?","Jim Daly","We\u2019re working very intensely with the patient advocacy groups.  There\u2019s no better catalyst for a patient request than an MF patient hearing about a positive response in another patient.  As a matter of fact, recent market research we\u2019ve conducted have indicated almost 40% of patient trials are as a result of a patient request for the product, so clearly these patients are talking to each other and sharing the experience.  And we\u2019re trying to support that as much as possible.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer ","Thank you for taking my questions.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of David Friedman with Morgan Stanley.  Pleas proceed with your question.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Thanks, it\u2019s been answered.  Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Lisa Bayko with JMP Securities.  Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Hi, good morning.  A question for Jim: as you look at the profile of Baricitinib and Tofacitinib, can you talk about maybe the key attributes of Baricitinib that you think are really going to stand out and how from a marketing perspective you\u2019d really use those to differentiate the two products?  Thanks.","Jim Daly","Thank you for the question.  I\u2019m going to pass it over to my colleague Rich, but what I can say very early is there is an X factor for oral.  If you look at the RA market, there\u2019s at least 10% to 20% of patients who refuse therapy with the [TNF] because it is injectable, so clearly there\u2019s an X factor for oral.  And then depending on the clinical studies, the label and the price, I think that will determine the point of entry of JAKs into the market.","Rich Levy","Lisa, I think also Lilly may comment on this in a couple weeks, but I think the things that are clear already are once a day versus twice a day and reduced number of drug interactions, because this drug doesn\u2019t have\u2026 [The factor they\u2019re delivering] doesn\u2019t have the same enzyme inhibitions and interactions that tofacitinib does.  I think the potential which needs to be proven in large Phase III trials is that it may have a better safety profile in terms of infections because it\u2019s not a JAK3 inhibitor; and some of our data suggests that we may have actually a more profound response in Phase II than they did, but it\u2019s really unfair to say that we know that\u2019s going to hold up based on trials that were one, not comparative and were only a few hundred patients.","But I think we have enough there that there will be a substantial market for Baricitinib, and the potential that it could actually be the number one JAK inhibitor for RA and potentially others if some of those potentials for the data come true despite a launch a few years later.","Lisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And then just maybe a follow-up to the broader oral market.  As you see the orals come to the market and you look at tofacitinib, do you think this will move up to kind of front line?  I mean it makes sense that you\u2019d use oral ahead of [TNF] but obviously there\u2019s more experience. ","Rich Levy","So front line is largely methotrexate but the question, and I think it\u2019s likely to stay that way in part because of payer preferences to start with something cheap; and also the fact that physicians are comfortable with the toxicities of methotrexate, although there\u2019s certainly people who can\u2019t take it and there\u2019ll be some use in first line.  I think the key is using this before anti TNF\u2019s or other biologics.  ","My expectation is that Pfizer will blaze that path to a certain extent for the class, and so they may start off being used primarily, after at least the first if not more than one TNF.  But as the safety of the class becomes more clear and as people become more convinced of the efficacy by using it themselves, the fact that it is an oral drug and some of the other advantages that it has that we kind of talked about, I think the real goal is to be able to say this would be after failure of DMRs or methotrexate for the most part; but would still then be used and will have clinical data that it can be used after failures of TNFs.","Lisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Thank you.","Operator","Our last question comes from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.  Please proceed with your question.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","So just a question on Baricitinib versus your follow-on JAK inhibitor: can you just give us a sense of how different you need the follow-on JAK to be for you to pursue development in RA and psoriasis?","Paul Friedman","I\u2019ll start and Rich can add to that.  I don\u2019t think we can give you parameters at this point until we gather some data on this JAK inhibitor with a different profile.","Rich Levy","But if you look at things like the anti-TNF market, and there are a number of anti-TNFs.  Certainly the first one is no longer\u2026 Maybe it still is \u2013 I\u2019m not sure which sells more, [Numera or Embrel].  ","Jim Daly","I\u2019m totally biased in this answer but it is Embrel.","Rich Levy","But still you wouldn\u2019t sneeze at the market that a drug like Numera has, and I think those differences in the anti-TNFs are not enormous in my mind.  So I personally don\u2019t think you need huge differences to do really well in this area, but as I said in answer to Lisa\u2019s question I think there is the potential for substantial differentiation and a clear expectation of enough differentiation.","","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Just two parameters to the question: one is obviously I think we all appreciate the magnitude of the opportunity but also we\u2019re mindful of just the costs associated with bringing another RA drug to the market; and whether, to put it in your words, if you can afford to run or support a Baricitinib program as well as pursue development independently in RA.  Is it an either\/or decision from a financial perspective or do you think you can comfortably pursue both?","Dave Hastings","Well, I think we have optionality and we\u2019re at the point now where the earlier stage program, we certainly have the capital to continue to progress that; and then as the data becomes more apparent we can make strategic decisions at that point.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","There are no further questions at this time.  I\u2019d like to hand the floor back over to management for closing comments.","Paul Friedman","Okay, thanks very much.

Thank you Ms. Murphy, you may now begin.","Pamela M. Murphy","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Incyte\u2019s third quarter 2013 conference call. On the call today are Paul Friedman, Incyte\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, Jim Daly, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, Dave Hastings, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer and Rich Levy, Executive Vice President and Chief Drug Development and Medical Officer.","Paul will begin with a brief overview of the quarter, Jim will follow with an update on the ongoing commercialization of Jakafi, Rich will then highlight progress made in our lead clinical programs and Dave will describe our third quarter financial results. Paul will then open the call up for Q&A.","Before beginning, we would like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations for the commercialization of Jakafi, our development program for Jakafi and other indications and for other compounds in our pipeline and our expectations for net product revenue. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risk and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2013 and from time to time in our SEC documents. Paul?","Paul A. Friedman","Good morning, everyone. Incyte\u2019s third quarter was a highly productive one. As expected with Jakafi we\u2019re continuing to establish a strong commercial foundation in myelofibrosis. In the third quarter Jakafi experienced solid, consistent growth with steady new patient adds and new prescribers and we\u2019re starting to see physicians become more appreciative of the need to treat patients earlier in the course of the disease.","We also continue to see a modest, yet meaningful increase in persistency rates and we believe physicians are hearing and understanding the message that dosing should be individualized for each patient and they\u2019re changing their behavior accordingly. We\u2019re confident that we will reach the high end of our 2013 guidance for net product revenues which we increased last quarter to a range of $220 million to $230 million.","In his remarks Jim will provide more color around Jakafi and myelofibrosis as well as the anticipated launch of Jakafi and Polycythemia Vera. With a potential approval in PV on track for late 2014 we see a significant opportunity and continue to grow revenues and to position Jakafi as best in class among emerging MPN treatments.","Jakafi shows potential beyond MPNs, recent data from the Phase II RECAP trial in second line pancreatic cancer suggest a significant growth opportunity for Jakafi and pancreatic cancer among a well defined patient subgroup and provide a strong rationale for use in other solid tumors. The growing potential of Jakafi is just one part of our story however.","Our core competency in medicinal chemistry tightly integrated with biology has been a primary driver of productivity in drug discovery and we now have a growing robust pipeline that extends far behind one product.","In his remarks Rich will discuss several of these clinical programs, but there are few I\u2019ll highlight briefly now. The strong alliance with Lilly provides optimal potential value for our second JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor baricitinib. Lilly is evaluating baricitinib and rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis and diabetic nephropathy and we believe the compound has the potential to be best in class.","We\u2019ve a broad portfolio of JAK1 inhibitors that gives us the option to pursue oncology and chronic inflammatory conditions with distinct compounds, an approach that has worked well for us with the JAK1 and JAK2 program. With our lead JAK1 inhibitor INCB39110 we recently presented very positive data from our proof of concept trials in psoriasis and in rheumatoid arthritis. You will see additional proof of concept data in myelofibrosis at ASH; we\u2019re also evaluating the compound in other malignancies in combination with established chemotherapeutic agents in particular those that are more highly myelosuppressive.","The second JAK1 inhibitor has entered clinical trials and the data from these studies and other trails that we\u2019re planning will help us determine which compounds to pursue and in which indications. Beyond our JAK programs we have other compounds in the clinic including our Indoleamine Dioxygenase or IDO inhibitor INCB24360 which is a novel oral compound being evaluated for its potential to enhance immune responses to tumors. We\u2019re evaluating 24360 both as monotherapy and in combination with four multiple oncologic indications.","We\u2019ve also advanced our first PI3K delta inhibitor INCB40093 in the clinical development. With the PI3K delta inhibitor and our portfolio of JAK inhibitors we believe we\u2019re particularly well positioned to leverage both classes of molecules in areas of high unmet medical need to potentially improve treatment outcomes for patients.","With that I\u2019ll turn the session over to Jim.","Jim Daly","Thank you, Paul and good morning everyone. Our third quarter results reflect continued solid progress in executing our strategy to grow Jakafi in patients with intermediate or high risk MF.","In terms of quarter-over-quarter growth net sales grew 11% with the following components of growth. Underlying demand as measured by bottles dispensed to patients grew by 8%. Net price accounted for 3% of growth, inventory levels remained relatively constant and third quarter inventory remains within the normal range of three to three and a half weeks.","Our third quarter performance is consistent with our expectations for steady growth in underlying demand. Based upon the trends we are seeing in new patient starts and persistency, we expect to see continued solid growth in the fourth quarter and as Paul indicated to achieve the high end of our current net product revenue guidance of $220 million to $230 million.","New patient starts remain consistent with previous quarters and the number of prescribers continues to increase. Through the third quarter more than half of our target prescribers have prescribed Jakafi at least once. We believe these dynamics are driven by a growing recognition of the disease modifying effects of Jakafi in MF as evidenced by survival data and fibrosis data. Physicians are becoming increasingly aware of the medical imperative to treat patients earlier in the disease.","With respect to persistency, the expanded dosing guidance in the label for patients with low platelet counts approved by the FDA in June has been well received by physicians and we continue to see 5 milligrams and 10 milligrams strengths representing a growing percentage, nearly 50% of dispensed bottles.","While we originally expected to expand our oncology sales force for the PV launch, we\u2019ve accelerated our plans to capitalize on what we see as sustainable longer term growth remaining in MF. We\u2019re currently recruiting for 20 new positions which will bring our total number of sales representatives to 80. We\u2019re encouraged by the tremendous volume of qualified applicants we\u2019re receiving for these openings and expect to have most of these positions filled and trained by January 1.","Novartis is also experiencing solid growth for Jakavi in Europe and rest of world. They reported third quarter sales of $48 million as compared to the $33 million sold in the second quarter. Novartis also reported reimbursement approval in a second major European country Germany in the third quarter and we continue to expect a third approval which triggers a $60 million milestone payment in the first half of 2014.","And while the MF market continues to grow at a healthy rate, we\u2019ve an exciting opportunity to build on that growth with a potential new indication in PV next year. We believe the addressable PV population is substantially larger than the addressable MF population.","When Hematologists, Oncologists are surveyed about their PV patients, they typically think about the 70% to 80% of their patients who are generally well controlled with phlebotomy or HU treatment and report relatively high satisfaction with current treatments.","However, when reviewing patient charts these same physicians readily recognize the 20% to 30% of patients in their practice who suffer with uncontrolled PV while on best available therapies. Uncontrolled PV includes elevated hematocrit and debilitating symptoms. These patients represent the unmet need and a major commercial opportunity for Jakafi.","We\u2019ve always said, MPNs are just the beginning. As Rich will describe, we\u2019ve a number of potential opportunities in solid tumors that could significantly increase the number of patients who benefit from Jakafi. We\u2019ve a stable of JAK1 selected compounds with potential applications in oncology and inflammation. And finally, we\u2019ve a broader pipeline of innovative molecules in the clinic that together represent an outstanding opportunity for Incyte to make a meaningful difference for patients.","I\u2019ll turn it over to Rich.","Richard S. Levy","Thanks, Jim. As Paul said earlier, we\u2019ve made considerable progress with our compounds in development [technical difficulty] The emerging results show great potential for our portfolio in oncology and inflammation. First, with respect to our development in myeloproliferative neoplasms we submitted a number of abstracts for ASH which we expect to reinforce Jakafi\u2019s position as what we believe is the best in class treatment for patients with intermediate or high risk myelofibrosis.","Earlier this month we submitted an sNDA for inclusion of survival data into Jakafi\u2019s labeling for myelofibrosis. Based on prior discussions with FDA, I continue to believe the agency is amenable to some display of these data. For our Phase III registration study for Polycythemia Vera, it's being conducted under an SPA. We expect to release top line data in the middle of the first half of 2014 and to submit the sNDA in June. Assuming a six month review we would have potential approval before the end of 2014.","The companion study in PV and piled RELIEF is a double-blind study focused on symptomatic improvements. While the study is nearly full year accreted, the results of this 16 week study won\u2019t be included in the original submission for the PV indication, but we expect to submit an sNDA for inclusion of the symptom data into the package insert shortly after the anticipated original approval for PV. Our goal is to present data from both RESPONSE and RELIEF at a scientific session in the second half of 2014.","Moving to our other oncology indications for JAK inhibitors, in August we released top line results from our Phase II study of ruxolitinib in combination with capecitabine and second line pancreatic cancer. It was the hazard ratio for overall survival of 0.47 in a prospectively defined sub set of patients pre-selected as most likely to benefit from JAK pathway inhibition.","Based on our confidence in these data, we are moving forward aggressively in pancreatic cancer and other solid tumors. We submitted a Phase III registration study for pancreatic cancer to FDA for review and anticipate that we will begin randomizing in dosing patients in the first half of 2014. We are also planning to initiate three additional randomized Phase II trials to evaluate ruxolitinib in non-small-cell lung cancer, colon cancer and breast cancer starting in the first half of next year.","Each study will focus on the selected sub group identified from the study in pancreatic cancer and will combine ruxolitinib with therapies with low to moderate myelosuppressive effects. While powered as pilot studies each will have overall survival as a primary end point.","As Paul mentioned we are also evaluating our JAK1 inhibitors in oncology focusing initially in combination that may not be as well tolerated with ruxolitinib as a result of the myelosuppressive potential of JAK2 inhibition. We have an ongoing study in advanced cancer patients evaluating our lead JAK1 inhibitor 39110 in combination with the highly myelosuppressive regimens of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel.","Additionally, we plan to initiate two randomized Phase II studies with 39110 in solid tumors, also starting in the first half of 2014. The first of these is expected to be similar to the Phase II pancreatic study with ruxolitinib to confirm our hypothesis that similar survival benefits can be seen with a selective JAK1 inhibitor.","The second study is expected to include patients with non- small-cell lung cancer in combination with a more myelosuppressive regimen. Results of these three studies will help guide our future plans for use to JAK1 inhibitors in solid tumors. We believe our JAK1 inhibitors also have a role, an additional hematological tumors in combination with established and investigational therapies.","For example, we advanced our after first PI3K delta inhibitor insight 40093 into a Phase I monotherapy dose escalation study. Upon completion of this study we plan to initiate a safety and efficacy study of 40093 in combination with a selective JAK1 inhibitor and this is expected to start around the end of this year and will focus on patients with B cell lymphoma. These two distinct mechanisms exhibit synergy and preclinical study. In this early development program exemplifies are interested in exploring novel crossed portfolio combinations in areas of unmet medical need.","I will now turn to the progress made with our JAK1 inhibitors for inflammatory indications. During the last four weeks, we presented results for our first proprietary JAK1 selective inhibitor, 39110 in psoriasis at EADV and in rheumatoid arthritis at ACR. For psoriasis after four weeks of treatment with the top dose of 600 milligrams once daily, 46% of patients had cleared or almost cleared their psoriatic lesion. And the three months study in rheumatoid arthritis presented three days ago at ACR, the top dose also of 600 milligrams once daily showed an ACR20 response rate of 91% and ACR50 of 64% and ACR70 of 55%.","Well, these studies are small and it's difficult to compare the results of other established in investigational therapies. I believe the magnitude of effect in both psoriasis and RA studies of 39110 would compare very favorably. In both studies, all those levels are generally well tolerated out of myelosuppressive effect. The results are promised for 39110 are possibly one of our other orally administered JAK1 inhibitors in inflammatory diseases.","Well, it remains our intent to develop a JAK1 inhibitor for select inflammatory disorders, possibly with a partner, our top priority for a JAK1 inhibitors is in hematology and oncology. Data from ongoing and plan study should help us to decide which of our portfolio of JAK1 inhibitors are best suited to combination with myelosuppressive chemotherapy and which are best suited for years in inflammatory indications.","We are also excited about the potential opportunities with insight 24360 or IDO1 inhibitor in oncology. Like CTLA4, PD1 and PDL1, IDO1 is emerging as a novel checkpoint mechanism which may allow cancers to escape the host immune response. We have a combination study with ipilimumab in melanoma ongoing. We\u2019re encouraged by the early data and look forward to presenting the results of the open label, dose finding running portion of the study probably at ASH call next year.","Combined checkpoint inhibition looks to be an important to new treatment option, new treatment approach for solid tumors. Based on the emerging data for 24360, we believe it may offer an exciting advance in the immuno oncology space and we are in discussions to collaboratively explore relevant combination regimens. We also have ongoing studies of 24360 monotherapy in ovarian cancer and are supporting an ongoing investigator sponsored study of 24360 again with monotherapy in myelodysplastic syndrome, as well as a collaborative study in combination with a melanoma polyvalent peptide vaccine.","And while we have a very robust development stage portfolios with JAK inhibitors, our PI3K delta inhibitor and an IDO inhibitor, we also have several active programs directed at new oncology targets which we look forward to describing to you after these programs reach the clinical stages of development.","With that I will turn it over to Dave.","David C. Hastings","Thanks Rich. Good morning everybody. Let's start with product revenue. We recorded $60.2 million of Jakafi net product revenue in the third quarter. Our gross to net adjustment for product revenue recognized was approximately $5.6 million or about 8.5% for the third quarter. We still expect that our full-year growth in net adjustment will range from 8% to 9%. In addition, we recorded $8.2 million in product royalties from Novartis for sales of Jakavi outside the United States. ","Now moving to operating expenses, our cost of goods sold for the third quarter was immaterial. As our [starting] [ph] finished goods inventory was previously expensed as R&D prior to FDA approval. Both R&D and SG&A expenses were within our expectations.","Now, moving to the balance sheet, in terms of cash, we ended the third quarter with $291 million of cash and equivalents. In addition, during the third quarter, the company entered into separately negotiated agreements with certain holders of 4.75% convertible senior notes in which such holders agreed to exchange approximately $37 million in aggregate principal amount of the notes for the 4.2 million shares of the company\u2019s stock and to which the notes were convertible.","The holders also received $1.5 million, which are recorded debt exchange expense in the third quarter. Now importantly, this amount is significantly less than what we owed in future interest expense on the exchange bonds had those notes remained outstanding. In total of the original $400 million principal balance of these notes, we have now completed separately negotiated exchanges of approximately $181 million of the notes in 2013.","So in conclusion, we continue to make solid progress on multiple fronts and I believe we are in a strong financial position. So with that Paul, I\u2019ll turn it back to you. ","Paul A. Friedman","Operator, let's please go straight to Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, we will now be conducting question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Thomas Wei of Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. ","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Hi, thanks. I have a couple of questions on slightly different topics, the first just wanted to find out if you are able to provide any more granular detail on persistence rates and new patient starts on Jakafi? And then, on the solid tumor program that you are expanding into, can you give us a little bit more detail on what percent of non-small-cell lung cancer, colon and breast cancer would qualify for the study based on the criteria from the pancreatic subgroup that would be helpful in terms of sizing those opportunities. And based on the pancreatic press release that you had put out where there is mention of durable tumor responses, I guess I wanted to understand do you think that Jakafi is working predominantly through a direct antitumor effect and would there be actually a potentially big difference between JAK1 and JAK2 in that way? Thanks.","Jim Daly","Hi Thomas, this is Jim. I will take the first part of your question. Regarding new patient starts, they have been remarkably consistent quarter-over-quarter. So we have not seen a deceleration in the absolute number of new patients starts quarter-over-quarter. With respect to persistency, we really don't want to get into specific metrics around how long patients are staying on a product, only because it's a moving target. Our best indicator of improved persistency is really looking at the dosing practice of physicians starting at lower doses and titrating as appropriate. So we are using 5 milligram and 10 milligram tablets as an indicator of physicians individualizing dosing and we continue to see that move very nicely upward quarter-over-quarter.","So with respect to the specific metrics of persistency, there is a number of different ways you can measure that, you can look at the number of patients who stay on 12 months after initiation. You can look at the number of patients who drop off in a given month. We do have some variability in the data sources particularly as patients switch from plan to plan.","So we would prefer to really look at underlying demand as measured by total dispensed bottles and then really let you triangulate between new patients starts and total patients in order to back into the persistency.","Richard S. Levy","So with respect to the clinical questions that you asked, first solid tumors in terms of what percent would qualify, I mean based on what we saw in the pancreatic cancer where we said it would be approximately 50% of patients. We believe that's also true in these other solid tumors, you know within a ballpark.","Now the other thing you have to consider in terms of looking at the size of the opportunities there is line of therapy. We haven\u2019t really disclosed where we are looking but it's pretty \u2013 it should be pretty clear that we are not focusing initially on first line therapy and so when we talk about the approximately 50% of patients that applies often to the lines of therapy that we are going be focusing on initially and as we move towards first line those numbers could come down a little bit.","With respect to the effects within pancreatic cancer, we are seeing survival benefits that I think are beyond what you might expect based simply on response rates even though there were durable responses seen only in the patients that received ruxolitinib in addition to capecitabine. And in terms of the differences between JAK1 and JAK2, our hypothesis is based on everything that we know that the mechanism should be equally applicable to both JAK1 selective inhibitors as well JAK1\/2 inhibitors. However, the proof of concept that we have right now is with ruxolitinib which inhibits both JAK1 and JAK2 and that is part of the reason why one of the studies that we are planning to start in the first half of next year is looking at one of our selective JAK1 inhibitors to make sure we can reproduce those results before we make an even larger investment for our JAK1 selective inhibitors in other solid tumors.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Salveen Richter of Canaccord, please proceed with your question.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Thanks for taking my questions. I am just wondering what the, if you could just maybe elaborate on the overall strategy with the JAK1, how do we think about that strategy in inflammatory space and then how is it de-prioritized relative to the heme-oncology opportunity and how we should think about solid tumors versus heme opportunities especially with 110? And then, just a competitive question, Gilead just started their Phase III trial with their JAK versus [Rux] [ph], I mean, what are your expectations there and how do you think, if this drug should come to market, it will play out in the marketplace?","Paul A. Friedman","Why don\u2019t you take the first part.","Richard S. Levy","Okay. So with respect to our overall strategy for JAK1 we believe that the strongest most, the strongest opportunity and those that we have a clear competitive advantage and lead on are in oncology for both solid and liquid tumors. But we have multiple JAK1 selective inhibitors two of which are already in the clinic and our first goal is to figure out which of the drugs is best suited for use with more highly myelosuppressive chemotherapies and once that decision has been made then pursue the inflammatory indications with the one that is best suited to inflammation either alone or possibly with a partner. And was the next question simply the question on the competition or was there another question in between?","Paul A. Friedman","Solid versus \u2013","Richard S. Levy","Solid versus liquid. So I think the opportunities are excellent in both places with the data that we have besides myelofibrosis right now is in pancreatic cancer with ruxolitinib which happens to be a solid tumor. So we are certainly planning to pursue solid tumors with both ruxolitinib and in other cases with a JAK1 selective inhibitor, but as we said we are starting a combination study with a JAK1 inhibitor with 40093 \u2013 a PI3K delta Inhibitor because we believe that there will be synergy in the clinic there and there is no reason why the same drug can't be approved, developed and then approved for both solid tumors and liquid tumors so we don\u2019t feel that there is a need to have separate molecules for those and we plan to pursue both.","Jim Daly","Salveen, with respect to competition our \u2013 we have always expected competition, our view is that competition is good for patients, is good for the market, ultimately more patients will be treated with the JAK inhibitor, so the question really comes down to which product will they be treated with that's the function of product profile, we are absolutely convinced we have a best in class profile with Jakafi. With respect to Gilead having just started their Phase III they\u2019re a long way off from the market. If you look at their study design, they seem to be with a secondary endpoint looking at transfusion independence. From our point of view, cytopenias is an on-target effect with JAK1, JAK2 inhibition, it's predictable, it's manageable and we think between now and when Gilead were to come to the market, cytopenias will be an issue that physicians are very comfortable dealing with through individualized dosing with Jakafi. ","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from Rachel McMinn of Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. ","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America","Yes. Thanks very much, a couple of questions. One, Rich, I was hoping you could flash out a little bit more helping to set expectations for your IDO inhibitor at ASCO. Are we looking for just a responses there, would we have any PHS for overall survival data that we could begin to look at and then I don't know either Rich or Paul, if you could talk about the PV read through from Sanofi discontinuing their Phase II monotherapy study, I think that kind of spooked some people. I don't know if you have any futility analysis that was already built into your Phase III that you could speak to that gives you confidence beyond just to be obviously the strong data you have in the Phase I, II study?","And then, lastly, how do we think about all of these studies with regards to 2014 R&D. It sounds like you are making a really big push and solid tumor is not surprisingly, but I just want to make sure that we\u2019re kind of well prepared to think about how to model expensive next year? Thanks.","Richard S. Levy","Okay, so with respect to IDO, what we are going to likely present in 2014 are the results of an open label running where everyone is getting both IDO inhibitor 24360 and ipilimumab. And this is a dose escalation to find the proper dosage for the randomized study that will be definitive. What we would expect to be able to show based on what we are seeing now are our response rates. The duration of maintaining therapy before they have to change to something else likely as a result of progression and how long those individuals are living and we are fairly confident based on data that we have right now that, that will compare favorably to historical controls with ipilimumab alone and that is the basis of our level of excitement right now.","But in terms of actually having robust data and comparison to ipilimumab alone that will be coming in later years after we really get into the randomized portion of the study. Now, with respect to PV, we have only read the restatement in the Sanofi press release from yesterday saying that they, you know, halted that study and plan on looking a combination therapy. We have no idea and we would be interested in finding out others as well. ","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America","They said it does that -- Yes, they said it doesn't live up to their internal expectation was the comment that I understand. So, I am assuming that's just a failure to have robust efficacy.","Richard S. Levy","Yes. So I don't know exactly what they \u2013 I don't know exactly what their issue is and we still try to find out more about that. But let me just talk about our place. So, first of all the PV data from this Phase II study 256 was just published online yesterday in cancer, so that is out there for people to look at. Secondly, that our registrations study, the response study, not only has been fully enrolled for almost a year, but all of the patient surpassed the primary endpoint now we just need to wait for all, which is basically at 32 weeks, all patients need to have four to eight week data before we have last patient, last visit and look at the data.","But we know from a vigilance perspective that there are no issues with the study in terms of safety and we have no indication from the study that there will be a lack of efficacy. I can't imagine why the results would be particularly different from what we saw in Phase II, where we have like 97% of the patients become phlebotomy independent, patients had profound reductions in spleen size at least as measured by palpation, patients demonstrated symptomatic improvement in that study. So, we remain confident in our study and are curious when eventually the data comes out from the Sanofi as to where they ran into problems with their drug. And with respect to R&D expense in \u201914, I will turn that over to Dave.","David C. Hastings","Thanks, Rich. Yes, Rachel, I think you are right, it is an aggressive plan, and rightly so. I mean, we are very confident and optimistic about our portfolio. Like it's pretty consistent with what we\u2019ve said in the past that the return on investment as we invest in our R&D, pipeline is very strong, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we\u2019re in a strong financial position, we continue to focus on optimize in the capital structure of the company as evidenced by the recent exchanges we perform. So I think we are in a good position to fund an increased R&D investment next year.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes in the line of Matt Roden of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks for taking my question as well and Happy Halloween. On the IDO program, can you talk about the evidence that suggested this should be additive or synergistic with the checkpoint inhibitor? Just try to give us a sense for why you think this approach should work and then, related, we all know that Charlie Sawyer has been pushing this idea, the combinations of investigational agency in cancer should be pursued but operationally, can you talk about the password and combining idea, with PD1 or PDL1 inhibitors and then, if I may a follow up?","Richard S. Levy","Okay. So first as I mentioned in response to an earlier question. Just with respect to our drug and checkpoint inhibitor, if you let me map, which is a CTLA4 inhibitor. We are seeing response rates, we are seeing how long patients are taking to progress and we\u2019re seeing survival data that is early and small numbers, but looks to us quite different than the early data with ipilimumab monotherapy and similar patient population. There is also, animal models in vitro data that suggests synergy between our drug and PD1 inhibitors in PDL1 inhibitors, but there is no clinical data there.","With respect to the logistics of how this can work, I think companies, in several areas have now become much more amenable to working together at the investigational stage prior to the approval of the either of the drugs. FDA is making that easier, recognize the benefits in cancer as well. And so we have started discussions with other companies, not to partner our program or to sell it to them, but to maintain the program ourselves while looking at combination therapies and I don't want to get into any specifics about that until things have matured, but right now we are reasonably optimistic to that one or more studies might start next year in combination.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Okay and then from the regulatory perspective, are they on board with a combinations as well?","Richard S. Levy","So we have had experience with FDA in terms of combinations of investigational drugs. At this stage where we have no specific agreements with any company, no protocols have actually been submitted to FDA or other health authorities to say that those studies can go forward other than the fact that we \u2013 I mean, not that ipilimumab isn't an approved drug, but they had no issues with combining those and that data will help us justify those selection and other things for combinations with PD1s and PDL1s or whatever we end up doing. So I don't have specific FDA or other health authority feedback, but I don't think it's going to be a major problem.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Okay and then Rich, you also mentioned the JAK1 PI3 Kinase combinations and I think you said B Cell lymphoma, quite a heterogeneous group here. Can you help us where you think this combination might be best applied into rationale for addressing those particular subsets?","Richard S. Levy","So, I mean, the first part of the study will look at a range of B cell lymphoma's, as we try to establish the doses of the two drugs in combination and establish what safe combination can be looked at that study may also give us further hints as to where we would likely focus in the future. Certainly with respect to either the stat more established or further along in development PI3K deltas or BTK inhibitors. There are places where those drugs are active, but we think there's a lot of room for improvement, either in terms of the number of responses or the duration of those responses. And so that need for increased benefit is the key driver now and I can tell you that in vitro synergy studies suggest the potential for benefit in those same indications where you are seeing suboptimal benefit with either BTK or another PI3K delta inhibitor. ","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on the pipeline success.","Richard S. Levy","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on all the progress on multiple fronts. Question on the pancreatic study, I realize lot of the data, you are going to preserve for ASCO but, I was just wondering if you give us any sense to the number of pre-specified subgroups that you looked at and maybe how the hypotheses that these are testing differed or perhaps overlapped? And then, can you give us on any sense on in terms of the bar for label expansion potentially based on those three, Phase II solid tumors studies that you are going to be running for ruxolitinib given the overall survival and point there? Thanks.","Richard S. Levy","Okay. So with respect to the number of subgroup analysis, we actually had, as we\u2019ve said in the past, more than one and less than five, pre-specified analyses based on the potential mechanism of action. There were other subgroup analysis that were kind of routine, like age, gender, things like that, that were not including in the mix because those are just always, always there.","And with respect to how those differed, I really would rather not go into what the other two or three or one additional subgroup analysis was, until such time as we actually present the data. Now with respect to, I think your next question is about the Phase II and the expectations from that. So, the studies are really designed not to be registration studies, but if the results are robust and this time, already backing up the same group that, you know, with identified in pancreatic cancer, I can't say that there's no possibility we couldn't go directly to a label expansion, but I think the expectation from the most part should be that these are Phase II which would then lead to larger Phase III registration studies in any of the number of these indications.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Thanks Rich and congrats again. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from the line of Navdeep Singh of Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question.","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, good morning and thanks for taking my question. I understand that you can't provide much color on the biomarker for Jakafi and solid tumors given competition, but when you plan to release that information and if I can, how confident are you that biomarker will resonate with the scientific community?","Richard S. Levy","So, in terms of release of the information I mean, it would certainly be no later than when we expect to present the data at ASCO, but we recognize that, that holding it out for that long may not either be possible or appropriate. Depending upon what information seems to be leaking, various other things that could come about where we just feel obligated to do something. So I am not going to put a specific timeline on it. With respect to how well it's going to resonate, I think it's going to resonate, but I think that there are so few people out there that we have actually, community type oncologist that sort of thing that are aware of what's going on that don't have any data to support it one way or the other. Other than to say that it is consistent with the mechanism of action of JAK1 or JAK1 or 2 inhibition and therefore it should not come across in any way as, oh, they just got lucky, they just found some random thing and I think that's the best I can put it at this point in time. ","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay and just a quick follow up on your JAK1 inhibitor, I know that they are evaluating JAK1 inhibitor in a Phase I trial on solid humors. And I think that trial was initiated in June. When do you think, you can get some data on that, is ASCO [indiscernible] thanks.","Richard S. Levy","So, you know, it's hard to say exactly when we are going to present data from dose escalation Phase I studies because you never know exactly how many cohorts you are going end up doing before you reach the maximal tolerated dose, they are largely safety studies and so yes certainly it's possible that there will data out there and there is more than one study going on with JAK1 inhibitors right now in solid tumors. There is the combination with gem and paclitaxel as well as just a general solid tumor dose escalation study. And so it's reasonable to expect that you will see something in 2014, but for example, if that was to be submitted to ASCO that means submitting the data in the first quarter of 2014 and we are just not sure yet how robust that data set will be. So we don\u2019t want to make specific predictions and then not follow through on them. ","Navdeep Singh \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay thanks Rich and congrats on the progress. ","Richard S. Levy","Great, thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Ying Huang of Barclays. Please proceed with your question.","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays","Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Related to the -- on pancreatic cancer. So the first one is when you conducted the subgroup analysis did you spend any offer [ph] in conducting the analysis and then secondly I am sure Novartis has that done a lot of looks into the data here. When do you think Novartis would adopt in and when is the \u2013 I guess the latest time frame they could do that. And then on INCB39110 which is solid data from ACR which looks pretty encouraging, but I am not sure whether we see clear doses, among the three lower doses and we did see living lipids elevation at 600 QD dose. I was wondering what your thought is in terms of taking this count forward? Which dose would you likely select? Thank you.","Richard S. Levy","Okay. So thanks. So first of all, in terms of prospective planning of this study which was 120 patients approximately, there was no pre-specified alpha control for subgroup analysis. However, if you do Bonferroni correction which is most aggressive correction for multiple looks at subgroups. Based on those two to four other groups, the statistics of the subgroup does held up with the feedback, corrected value still less than 0.5. So again, we don\u2019t see this as an issue of chance. We see this as a pretty clear finding that's also supported by the mechanism action make sense as opposed to just statistical rigger. With respect to Novartis, they have no limitations as to when they can decide to opt into a program. So we cannot speak to when they may or may not decide to do that. And with respect to the Phase II data of 39110 in RA, we agree that there wasn\u2019t much of a dose response seen other than with the 600 milligram dose that was clearly, I shouldn\u2019t say clearly, in this study it was clearly better than the 100 BID, 200 BID and 300 QD. I think that you just would need larger numbers of patients to really be able to see that as well as potentially studying a lower dose than either 100 BID or 301 today to really see the full view of that dose response.","With respect to lipids, I mean all of the drugs that are being developed in the IR6 space, the JAK space, as well as to a lesser extend other anti-inflammatories increase LDL and HDL and so far this has not been a problem for any of them. We are aware that the (indiscernible) has put out data saying that they don\u2019t increase lipids, they actually do at their 300 milligram QD dose which is one that they have said they are not planning to take forward into Phase II. But clearly the effect is still there when you reach levels of the inhibition of the JAK1 target which is related to then inhibiting the signaling of IR6. So I don\u2019t think there are any exceptions to this mechanistic rule. ","Ying Huang \u2013 Barclays","That's fair. Thanks for the color. Very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov from JP Morgan. Please proceed with your question.","Matt Lowe \u2013 JP Morgan","Hi there, it's actually Matt Lowe in for Cory today. You mentioned, you are in ties with the early data in open label study for IDO, I am just wondering if you would characterize that at all and what you are looking at in the study? And then, also at ASH, I believe you\u2019re going to present the three years survival data for Jakafi. I was just wondering is there still a meaningful number of physicians who need to be convinced of the overall survival data. If you can comment on that that would be great? Thanks.","Richard S. Levy","Okay. So I don\u2019t really have much more to say on the IDO plus similar that I have said before but let me just reiterate the bottom line. So the things that we are looking at now in this small dose escalation open label study is comparison to historical controls and what we are seeing are response rates, the duration before someone has a progression event and the duration that those patients are living which we believe compared to published data on ipilimumab monotherapy in melanoma are better. But it's not a statistical comparison, not even a head-to-head comparison, yet it's a comparison to historical controls based on a relatively small number of our patients compared to a large number of patients in the Phase II and III studies with any ipilimumab but this along with some of the pre-clinical data that suggest synergy between these things gives us confidence that this is a real effect and gives us interest not only in following the study with ipilimumab but with other checkpoint inhibitors and putting PD1 and PDL1. With respect to the impact of three year survival data, I will turn that over to Jim. ","Jim Daly","Yes, there is still a significant proportion of the physicians who are not aware of the survival data with Jakafi so certainly publication and scientific meetings is incrementally helpful, but ultimately we think the major catalyst would be inclusion of the data in the package insert and again we are hopeful for that sometime next year.","Matt Lowe \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question. ","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks. Three questions maybe first for Jim, I am having a little trouble reconciling the unit volume growth 8% in the quarter down from 15% last quarter given the comments you made about studying these darts and maybe the increasing persistence, maybe you could clarify that? And for Rich, I think you indicated earlier that the initial focus here with the JAKs in solid tumors is later lines of therapy. Is that based on some mechanistic rationale or it's just because that\u2019s where you fortunate enough to get the first early read? And then lastly for Dave, just wondering if you have tax planning strategies in place for some of these newer assets I guess the JAK1s in particular that you are on worldwide rights to? ","Jim Daly","Hi Eric this is Jim. Here is an actual rhythm to the business in terms of our demand pattern, if you remember we did 7% dispense bottles in the first quarter and we did 15% the second quarter, 8% in the third quarter and what you will find is typically the first quarter in oncology particularly for orals tends to be one in which you got kind of the win your face with respect to deductibles, donate etcetera. there is also an issue of the number of shipping days and we had fewer shipping days first quarter, more shipping days second quarter. And the third quarter tends to be impacted more by quite frankly vacations whether it be patients or physicians there is reluctance to put patients on new products during the summer period. And typically we see a relatively strong fourth quarter. So that's the natural rhythm of the business. We were expected to repeat this year. So that really is the explanation for the 7%, the 15% and the 8%.","Richard S. Levy","With respect to lines of therapy, I mean with respect to ruxolitinib, we particularly looked for lines of therapy where the current treatment could include an option that was not very highly myelosuppressive and that was the lead basis for making those decisions. With respect to the JAK1s that\u2019s been less of an issue but it's still very hard to get directly into first line therapy. So we are not saying that we are starting each of our studies in last line by any means. I am saying that first line is hard to get to initially. And it just happens that there are in some of these diseases at least, the percentage of patients who would fit into the category where we worked very well in pancreatic cancer is a little bit higher in later lines maybe because their prognosis is not that good in the first place. But there is a number of patients who exists in first line is larger. So the total number of patients that might be available for treatment in the end can still be as larger and larger and they end in first line even if the percentages are little bit lower. So that was not really a key decision make on how we selected our Phase II studies.","David C. Hastings","And Eric, yes, we are working with our outside professionals service providers on those strategies in addition where you\u2019re actually recruiting internally for a tax director who would lead that role and of course I will remind you in the meantime we have a $1.3 billion NOL that can be utilized as well.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of David Friedman of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. ","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to get a sense of two things, one is of all of the Phase II, these randomized Phase II that are starting in long and colorectal, what is the sort of rough time frame to get data from those, is that 2015 or is that 2016? And then, the other question is just around some of the preclinical work that supports the tumors and I was wondering if you could just talk about what you have seen pre-clinically for pancreatic and how that is similar or different to what you see in longer colorectal but also prostate and myeloma where you had trials as well? Thanks.","Richard S. Levy","Okay. So we are not going to get specific about the time lines for the Phase II yet in part because we have not selected centers yet for all the studies to happen completely visibility to determine how many patients might be enrolled for a month or how many of each of those centers. The only thing I would say is that these are pilot studies like the Phase II recap study and the recap study from start to finish was about two years. So I think, assuming we start in first half of \u201914 with some of these studies, I think seeing in \u201915 is optimistic and seeing data in \u201916 is quite reasonable at this early stage of evaluation.","With respect to the pre-clinical work, I would really suggest that we\u2019ve a follow up call with you and the scientists. We\u2019ve done that work because I don\u2019t have all that information at hand to go into detail. Other than to say that there were clear pre-clinical models suggesting benefits in terms of pancreatic cancer and some of the other tumors have been well studied and have similar results but I\u2019m not \u2013 and that\u2019s not directing our line of responsibility and I don\u2019t have that information at hand today.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is with Liisa Bayko of JMP. Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi, this is [Drew Prigodich] [ph] for Liisa. Hi, there are couple of questions for you. One is, if you could talk a little bit about how the choices were made for the solid tumors you\u2019re developing first and including colorectal and breast? And second question is, where in the information space do you see the best opportunity for a JAK1 specific inhibitor?","Richard S. Levy","So in terms of the choices with respect rectal in there which is the place where we already have clear, perfect concept in pancreatic cancer, we were looking for major solid tumors and certainly the ones we\u2019ve announced that we\u2019re doing, long colon and breast are major solid tumors. But also where there was an opportunity to combine with something that was not very highly myelosuppressive. And with respect to JAK1 inhibitor at this stage, again, the first thing is to try to reproduce the recap results for the JAK1 inhibitor and the second in non-small-cells because it\u2019s a very large opportunity, large unmet need along with similar levels of evidence that this mechanism should work in these patients and that about 50% of the patients would quality into this subgroup that we think we work best in.","With respect to choices in inflammation, I mean, there is really a couple of things I would say. One is that one of the potential benefits are the selective JAK1 inhibitor is to go to levels of inhibition that you can\u2019t get to necessarily with a JAK1 and 2 inhibitor because at that point you would start to get into myelosuppression. And so, there are certain diseases psoriasis being one but certainly not the only one, but the place we have data where the data suggest that you do want higher levels of inhibition that is necessarily for maximal affect in something like rheumatoid arthritis. But obviously, something like rheumatoid arthritis is a very large opportunity and nothing to be dismissed off out of pan. So we\u2019ve not decided exactly what we would do in terms of this, our main priority right now is figuring out which molecule would go inflammation. And if we decide to partner the program then our partner would also have some influence on the \u2013 or a live influence probably on the choices that would be made in terms of which indications first and which indications would come later.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Skip Klein with Gauss Capital Advisors. Please proceed with your question.","Skip Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors","Thanks. Maybe I should start up by trying to soften \u2013 sincerely thanking you for all the good progress and execution in sales, balance sheet, clinical front there is lot going on, you guys are really executing. So then, the question I guess is really for Jim, I\u2019m working on the triangulation that he suggest and how much Jim whether you know that I answered to a higher authority. There is some ladies that play mahjong who are big fans of Dr. Friedman and they honestly pester me more than I\u2019ve ever been pestered in my investor life. And this is what I\u2019ve told him and I guess I\u2019m just wondering whether you could tell me whether I\u2019m in line or out of line. I\u2019ve told them that the company has treated about 5,700 patients in myelofibrosis out of about 12,000 available populations. I\u2019m telling him you\u2019ve about 3,300 on therapy, you\u2019re adding about a 120 to 125 patients a month on a net basis. So, I\u2019m telling you about the half way through MF opportunity, PV is to follow and is a bigger available population, I\u2019m telling them that I\u2019ve peak sales in 2025 and they remind me that they\u2019re not going to be alive then, but I tell him it\u2019s going to be 1.8 billion in peak sales at that point with pancreatic probability of technical success of about 60% to 70% so that\u2019s a lot. Am I roughly in line because these ladies I don\u2019t really want to embarrass my mother and they play mahjong with her?","Jim Daly","Skip, we haven\u2019t been that precise in communicating our patient numbers, but I think, you may be misleading the ladies with respect to the total addressable population. Again, we see an addressable population of basically 85% of the total MF population of 16,000 to 18,000, so let\u2019s call that 15,000 patients. You can segment pretty much into three groups, high risk 5,000, intermediate 2 5,000, intermediate 1 5,000. To-date I\u2019d say we have less than \u2013 considerably less than 5,700 patients who have touched drug for MF. So the way we\u2019re looking at it, we\u2019re probably into third inning, third or fourth inning with respect to our MF gain. And I think we\u2019re in a good position to be almost two years into launch and we\u2019re still characterizing our growth in terms of sequential quarter-over-quarter. Most oncology products experience relatively rapid peak and then a plateau and they\u2019re often taking about year-over-year growth rate at this point. We\u2019re still talking about double digit sequential quarter-over-quarter growth and I think that\u2019s because the nature of the disease. The heterogeneous disease with a spectrum of severity and it\u2019s also managed by community physicians and when you have a low prevalent disease managed by community oncologist it takes them some time to get comfortable with the new therapy and a disease they don\u2019t see that often. And I think we\u2019re seeing that with the solid consistent growth with Jakafi, but I think we have a lot of growth ahead of us with Jakafi and MF.","Skip Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors","Great, and then I greatly appreciate handling the fact that I was high on the treated patients, how about 3,300 on therapy and adding about a 120 a month because there is one lady that kind of focuses on that.","Jim Daly","Yes, I don\u2019t want to get into the new adds per month, well I can\u2019t say is that the relatively consistent. If you look at the number of patients who are on therapy, I would just suggest that really use your calculator, if we have $60 million in net sales for the third quarter and right now we realize about $7,600 assume 8% discount of a list of $8,300 and then divide by three months you will get closer to about 2,600 or 2,700 on therapy.","Skip Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors","Okay. Thank you very much and I guess the most important is peak sales, but I guess, I can\u2019t expect anyone really to comment on that. Is that way out of line if things go right to think that peak sales could be $1.5 billion to $2 billion for ruxo?","Jim Daly","Well, I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on anything outside of MPNs, but I think as we\u2019ve said in the past, we see Jakafi being a $0.5 billion opportunity in MF and we see the PV opportunity being at least as big if not bigger than the MF opportunity. And then obviously the programs that Rich has discussed that\u2019s all incremental.","Skip Klein - Gauss Capital Advisors","Great, thank you very much.","Operator","","Thank you. We are in the end of our question-and-answer session and time for one final question. That will be a follow up from the line Matt Roden of UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Matthew Roden \u2013 UBS","Well actually, it\u2019s been answered, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019ll now turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Paul A. Friedman","This is Paul. Thank you all for dialing in and for the dialogue we\u2019ve had this morning, I think we\u2019re making really good progress and the company looks forward to our next quarterly call and with that I\u2019ll be signing off.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. If you have not already done so, please close all other programs on your computer. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mike Booth, Vice President of Investor Relations for Incyte Corporation. Thank you. You may begin.","Michael Charles A. Booth - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Diego. Good morning and welcome to Incyte's third quarter 2016 earnings conference call and webcast. The slides used today are available for download on the Investor section of incyte.com.","Speaking on today's call will be Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot, our CEO, who will begin with some high level comments on our objectives and priorities here at Incyte. Herv\u00e9 will then pass to Barry Flannelly, who leads our U.S. organization and he will provide an update on Jakafi sales and prescription trends during Q3, as well as touch on Jakafi's recent inclusion in the NCCN Guidelines. Steven Stein, Incyte's Chief Medical Officer, will briefly review the updated ECHO-202 data of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab as presented at ESMO and provide some background on our decision to initiate a Phase 2 trial of our FGFR inhibitor 54828 for the treatment of patients with cholangiocarcinoma.","Dave Gryska, our CFO, will summarize our third quarter financial results before opening up the call for Q&A, for which we'll be joined by Reid Huber, our Chief Scientific Officer.","I'd like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for 2016 guidance, the commercialization of our products, and our development plans for the compounds in our pipeline. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially, including those described in our 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2016 and from time-to-time in our other SEC documents.","I'd now like to pass the call to Herv\u00e9 for some introductory remarks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. So, we have made excellent progress during the third quarter both on the top line as well as within our portfolio. But before we dig into the details, I'd like to begin our discussion today by taking a step back and talking briefly about what we are trying to build here at Incyte.","Cancer is one of the biggest challenge facing our society today. It not only have a significant impact on the wellbeing of millions of cancer patients, as well as their loved ones, but it also has a substantial economic impact, both through loss productivity and the effect on the healthcare system. The need for more effective treatment is clear and advances are being made.","As shown in the chart on the left side of slide six, since 2010, the number of new hematology and oncology approvals by the FDA has been on a upward trend. And the chart on the right illustrates how patient outcome in melanoma depicted as improvement in progression free survival have improved with different therapeutic regimens from chemotherapy through BRAF and MEK inhibitors to immuno-oncology doublets.","Many of us felt a sense of excitement at the ESMO conference last month given the wealth of data presented and the number of innovative therapy being discussed. It also provided us with stronger evidence as the scientific community where Incyte is an active participant is in the process of transforming the treatment of cancer.","Incyte is a company based on innovation and we strive to bring first or best-in-class therapies to patients in need. Our portfolio now contains 15 development candidates, across 11 different target and we employ around 1,000 people in the U.S. and across Europe. With total revenue in Q3 that grew 44% over the same period last year, we are in a position to reinvest our resources in multiple therapeutic opportunities.","Sales of Jakafi continued to show robust growth as we approach the five-year anniversary of its initial U.S. approval. And combining Jakafi sales in the U.S., Iclusig sales in Europe and Jakafi royalties from Novartis provides us with dynamic revenue growth. We also have an additional potential source of revenue from baricitinib, being developed by our partner, Eli Lilly, which is currently under global regulatory review for the treatment of patient with rheumatoid arthritis.","With our financial resources and dynamic top line growth, we can reinvest in the virtuous cycle of product development to bring additional innovative therapies to patients. We have a diverse portfolio of products and are building medical and commercial footprints in major markets around the globe. Having global development expertise in-house is already enabling us to develop our products more effectively, and we will also seek to use in-house commercial teams to successfully launch our products upon approval.","I will now pass the call to Barry for an update on Jakafi.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone.","Sales of Jakafi continue to perform well. In the third quarter, net product revenue from Jakafi was $224 million, a 39% increase over the third quarter of 2015, and an 8% increase over the previous quarter. In view of this strong growth, we are increasing our 2016 Jakafi net product revenue guidance to a range of $850 million to $855 million from the previous range of $825 million to $835 million. We're pleased that nearly five years after its first approval, we now have approximately 9,000 patients currently being treated with Jakafi, and that number continues to grow. Growth comes from our physician education efforts, especially detailing on the long-term benefits that Jakafi treatment provides.","The chart on the right side of slide 10 illustrates the strong year-on-year demand growth that we are experiencing with both at Jakafi's approved indications. In September, we announced that Jakafi has been included as a recommended treatment for appropriate patients with myelofibrosis in the latest NCCN Guidelines. Inclusion in the Guidelines will help inform healthcare providers, treatment decisions for patients with myelofibrosis. And we believe that inclusion in the NCCN Guidelines also underscores the important and long-term clinical benefits seen in patients treated with Jakafi.","We are also looking forward to the ASH Conference in December, where a pooled analysis of the five-year overall survival data from both COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II studies of Jakafi in patients with myelofibrosis will be presented.","I'd now like to pass the call on to Steven for a clinical update.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Barry. We've made good progress within our development portfolio since our last quarterly conference call. And today, I'd like to concentrate on the recent epacadostat data update at the recent European Society for Medical Oncology Meeting, and on our 54828, our FGFR inhibitor for which we've recently opened a second Phase 2 trial.","Last month, updated Phase 1 data from the ECHO-202 trial of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab in patients with advanced melanoma and select solid tumors were represented at the ESMO Annual Congress in Copenhagen.","I'd like to start my brief overview of the data with patient safety data. Now, with 56 weeks median follow-up for responders, and that's much greater drug exposure than our last presentation at SITC in November 2015, the combination of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab continues to be well tolerated. There were no treatment-related deaths and the maximum tolerated dose of epacadostat has not been reached. 19% of patients in the trial experienced grade 3 or 4 treatment-related adverse events and five patients or 8%, experienced treatment-related adverse events that led to discontinuation.","The next slide shows the waterfall and spider plots of the patients with treatment na\u00efve melanoma. The overall response rate in this population was 58% and the disease control rate was 74% by RECIST. For responders, the median follow-up was greater than 56 weeks with a range of 46 weeks to 90 weeks. Importantly, at this presentation, all responders remained in response at the time of the data cut.","Slide 15 shows progression free survival. The median progression free survival has not been reached. The six-month progression free survival rate is 74% and the 12-month progression free survival rate is 57%. With all the necessary caveats across trial comparisons, we believe our data compared favorably to established benchmarks. Recall that progression free survival is one of the two dual primary endpoints in the ongoing ECHO-301 Phase 3 trial of epacadostat plus pembrolizumab for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic melanoma.","Let's move on to our FGFR development program on slide 16. We announced in our second quarter update that we were initiating a Phase 2 trial of 54828 in patients with bladder cancer. The study is now open for recruitment. In addition, we've also opened a Phase 2 study of 54828 in patients with cholangiocarcinoma, the type of biliary tract cancer. While treatment for this type of cancer can be curative if found early enough for surgical resection, most cases are diagnosed in the later stages where resection is not a possibility.","Cholangiocarcinoma is rare with the incidence in the U.S. and Western Europe of around 1.6 cases per 100,000 population. The rates are significantly higher in Asia. In Japan for example, the incidence is 3.2 cases per 100,000 of population, while incidence in other Southeast Asian countries is higher still. Between 6% and 13% of all cholangiocarcinoma patients of FGFR2 translocations and an additional 5% of other FGF or FGFR alterations. We are not aware of differential genotypic rates by geography. The primary endpoints of the Phase 2 cholangiocarcinoma study will be overall response rate in patients with FGFR2 translocations. Secondary endpoints will include overall response rate in patients with other FGFR alterations.","Slide 17 summarizes the whole portfolio, which now includes 15 development candidates against 11 different molecular targets. The portfolio graphic now includes 57643 which is our second BRD inhibitor and which is currently in a dose-escalation study. As we have done with many of our programs, we have elected to progress two distinct BRD inhibitors into development. These compounds allow us an opportunity to evaluate different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles thereby increasing our optionality around decision-making in what is becoming an exciting therapeutic class.","I'll finish on our news flow slide. There are multiple potential value drivers for Incyte over the next 12 months. We are finalizing our plans to initiate the pivotal program for ruxolitinib in graft-versus-host disease. And we also expect to provide you with proof-of-concept data from our JAK1 program in graft-versus-host disease at the American Society Hematology Conference in early December. We remain on track to initiate 39110 plus osimertinib study in lung cancer by the end of the year. And we also look forward to providing you with initial clinical data from the FGFR and BRD programs next year as the data become available.","In immuno-oncology and beginning in the first half of next year, we look forward to sharing data from some of the Phase 2 cohorts of the ECHO trial of epacadostat in combination with PD-1 and PD-L1 inhibitors. We also remain on track to initiate a proof-of-concept study by anti-OX40 agonist antibody, 1949, in the fourth quarter of 2016. Data from Incyte's Phase 2 trial of topical ruxolitinib for the treatment of patients with alopecia areata have been accepted for presentation at the 2016 Alopecia Areata Research Summit, which is taking place in New York City on November 14 and 15. Last but not least, we are looking forward to the first regulatory decisions on baricitinib.","With that, I'll pass the call to Dave for the financials.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Steven, and good morning everyone. In the third quarter, we recorded $269 million of total revenue. This was comprised of $224 million in Jakafi net product revenue, $13 million in Iclusig net product revenue, $29 million in Jakafi royalties from Novartis and $3 million in contract revenue.","Jakafi's net product revenue of $224 million represents 39% growth over the same period last year. Based on Jakafi's performance year-to-date, we are increasing our full year Jakafi net product revenue guidance to a range of $850 million to $855 million. Our gross to net adjustment for the third quarter was approximately 12%. We expect that gross to net adjustment for the full year to be approximately 12%.","Our cost of product revenue for the quarter was $20 million. This includes the cost of goods sold for Jakafi and Iclusig, the payment of royalties in Novartis on U.S. Jakafi net sales, and $5 million for the amortization of acquired product rights, related to the Iclusig product acquisition. Our R&D expense for the quarter was $143 million, including $16 million in non-cash stock compensation.","Looking at projected R&D expense for the full year, we are updating our current guidance to a range of $570 million to $580 million. The reduction in projected R&D expense from the previous guidance for 2016 is in large part due to slower than forecasted head count growth and phasing of certain expenses from various programs and our development pipeline into next year.","We'll provide a range of next year's R&D expense on our fourth quarter call in February. And given the breadth of opportunities in our current portfolio, we expect a substantial increase in R&D expense in 2017. Our SG&A expense for the quarter was $76 million, including $10 million in non-cash stock compensation. We are on track to end the full year with our existing guidance in a range of $280 million to $310 million.","We recorded $8 million in expense related to the change in fair market value of the contingent consideration for the Iclusig royalty liability, and we expect the full year amount to be approximately $17 million.","Turning now to net income and earnings per share of the third quarter. We reported $37 million in net income or $0.20 per share basic and $0.19 per share diluted. We now expect 2016 net income to be in a range of $100 million to $110 million. This range also reflects the quarter-to-date decline in the market value of a long-term investment.","Looking at our balance sheet, we ended the third quarter with $717 million in cash and cash equivalents. We expect positive cash flow for remainder of the year and expect to end the year with over $750 million in cash and cash equivalents.","As noted in our press release, Novartis achieved pricing approval for Jakafi and polycythemia vera in the third major European country in October, which triggered a $40 million milestone. We will record this $40 million milestone in the fourth quarter.","To summarize, we are very pleased with Incyte's performance in the third quarter. Jakafi delivered strong revenue growth. We have fully integrated our new business unit in Europe. We grew our cash position and continue to make significant investments in our clinical development programs. Incyte is well positioned from a cash and operating income perspective to execute on our strategies for growth, which we are confident will deliver significant long-term shareholder value.","Operator, that concludes our prepared remarks. Please give your instructions and open up the call for Q&A. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we will be conducting our question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from Salveen Richter with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for taking my questions. Just given the milestones from Novartis (18:42) for the next three quarters and based business growth, it would appear that you will be EPS, got profitable, going forward. Is that a fair assumption? And then a second question on the bromodomain program, can you give us a little more clarity on the difference between 54392 (sic) [54329] (18:57) and the new molecule, will you be moving into different indications and when should we expect initial data from both? Thanks.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","So, Salveen, I'll answer the first question. Yes, we will be EPS positive for this year. As I mentioned, the range is between $100 million and $110 million. Obviously, we have not given guidance out for next year and we'll be doing that in our February conference call.","Reid M. Huber, PhD - Incyte Corp.","Yeah, Salveen, this is Reid. Thanks for the question on BRD. As we've done for many of our programs, we often will progress more than one molecule in the clinic, when it's appropriate to evaluate different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles in Phase 1. Bromodomain inhibition is an exciting therapeutic opportunity. I think we're still at the early stages of that. And we think we're best positioned by evaluating both 54329 and the follow-on compound, 57643. It's really about evaluating different PK profiles and potentially different pharmacodynamic profiles and seeing how that may affect efficacy and safety. So, we look forward to seeing those data merge over the next few quarters, and certainly we'll share them with you as we're ready.","Salveen Richter - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Please state your question.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thank you. Good morning, guys. Appreciate you taking the questions and nice quarter. So, two of them for you. I guess first of all, can you talk about the potential significance of the recent NCCN treatment guidelines for Jakafi and kind of how that might drive use, above and beyond how it's positioned in the market today? And do you know if there's a plan to publish guidance lines for PV as well?","And then my follow-up question was just a clarification. I was wondering if you could just talk about what you mean in your press release, where you say enrollment was suspended in the Phase 1\/2 trial for your PD-1. I guess the term suspended can mean a number of different things. Thanks.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","So, Cory, this is Barry. I'll answer the first couple of questions about the NCCN Guidelines. So, the easier one is they've indicated that they'll release some time in 2017 maybe over the next first six months of 2017 guidelines for polycythemia vera and essential thrombocythemia. The first question about whether \u2013 so we're just very positive about the NCCN, their approach to myelofibrosis and it reinforces our clinical data. We already have approval in patients who have intermediate 1 to high risk patients. And there's really very few patients in the low-risk category, maybe 10% of the patients there, recommendation was symptomatic patients that had low-risk. So, we think that represents a small patient population.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Cory, hi. It's Steven Stein. So, thanks for your question related to 1210. The ClinicalTrials.gov listing actually says active, not recruiting. As of October 21 this year, we notified investigators that enrollment of new subjects to the Phase 1 trial of 1210 had been placed on-hold in order to perform a thorough assessment of the compound's profile. I'm not going to be able today to give you any more details on this as we are in the midst of that review of that compound's profile.","Cory W. Kasimov - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Michael Schmidt with Leerink Partners. Please state your question.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I had two on Jakafi. A commercial question in terms of sequential growth, could you break out inventory versus price versus volume growth? And then, the second question is, as we're awaiting results from Gilead's momelotinib trials in MF later this quarter, can you give us a sense of how you think about your competitive position in MF, in particular, in patients that have anemia at baseline oral transfusion dependent, and how is Jakafi used in those patients for example? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","So, for your first question, Josh (sic) [Michael] (23:12) so all of the \u2013 so, there was no pricing in Q2 versus Q3. It was the same wholesale acquisition price and, in fact, there was very little inventory movement, one way or the other. So, the 8% growth quarter-over-quarter was almost entirely demand. Your second question related to momelotinib, we think the clinical profile of Jakafi stands up very well to any compound in the treatment of myelofibrosis, remember they're only going after an indication in myelofibrosis have no polycythemia vera indication. In terms of anemia, we'll see what their data reports out. But we know from further analysis of our COMFORT trials that patients that came in with anemia or experienced anemia while on Jakafi, in fact, it's still benefited from the drug and still had an improved survival advantage versus patients who did not receive Jakafi. So, we think it's a compelling clinical profile for the drug and we'll see what happens when they report out their data sometime in the future.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Schimmer with Piper Jaffray. Please state your question.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. First, you had indicated a substantial increased in R&D next year, I wonder if there's any way to quantify that ahead of your guidance? As well, as you think about advancing epacadostat into additional Phase 3 solid tumors settings, when do you think you'll have adequate data to inform those decisions and what kind of bandwidth do you expect to have in the R&D budget to accommodate multiple simultaneous Phase 3 programs? Thanks.","David W. Gryska - Incyte Corp.","Okay, so I'll answer the first part of your question. In terms of the R&D for next year, we are not going to quantify, what substantial means, is rest assured that it will go up from where it is today because there's some phasing and some shifting from this year into next year, into the R&D and Herv\u00e9 is going to answer your second part of your question.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yes. I mean, the reason why we spoke about the increase on next year is because as you saw in Q3, there were a number of expenses that we were maybe planning to see happening during the next few months that have been moved into next year. So, we wanted to make sure everybody understood that, in fact, the intensity of the development program is not slowing down at all. We have multiple projects that are starting. And in the case of epacadostat as I have said, I mean we would be open to multiple Phase 3 studies when the data is available, and we have the resources to do that, and we would not slowdown in any way the program for epacadostat based on budget impacting.","We are able now with the strength of our top line growth coming from multiple sources to sustain an effort for multiple Phase 3 over a period of years. So, that's really the picture we have. And the comment about next year was just to make sure that people understood that the way the Q3 R&D budget has been evolving is not something that you can trend for the next quarters. It will probably go through a rebound over the next few quarters.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Does that mean that you're not looking at this point to manage the business for bottom line growth, but more for R&D investment and capital allocation, or how do you think about or how do you see (26:50) bottom line?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","I mean that's what I was trying to say in my introduction. I think it's fundamentally important is that we are watching the cash flow very carefully. So, that's something that is truly important that we can finance our own investments in our own research by ourselves. And then we are looking at every opportunity to create value through product development.","So, if we see Phase 3 opportunities that are reasonable, we would do them, even if it has an impact on the short-term profitability over the next few quarters, because it's absolutely clear to us that it's the best interest of all our investors. And we are in a phase in cancer discovery, in cancer development, where we can see that opportunities are available today and maybe, they will not be there tomorrow. So, we will be looking at a case-by-case on the quality of the assets that we have in our pipeline and when we see opportunity to develop them, we will do that.","Joshua E. Schimmer - Piper Jaffray & Co.","Yeah. Thank you.","Operator","Out next question comes from Ying Huang with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please, state your question.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. My first one is regarding to the PD-1 enrollment suspension. Hypothetically, if you have to discontinue PD-1, I wonder what you could do with the GITR and OX40 program. Do you need to seek another PD-1 to combine with those IO assets?","And then, secondly, I want to ask about a potential event (28:26) strategy for non-small cell lung cancer. We have seen that the PD-1 antibodies are quickly becoming a first-line therapy in non-small cell lung cancer and we know that from your Phase 1 data, epacadostat as IDO1 inhibitor does not have activity in experienced patients who have already had PD-1 treatment. So, in that case, how would you develop IDO1 inhibitor in non-small cell lung cancer? Thank you.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Ying, hi. It's Steven Stein, thanks for your question. So, firstly, as regards, PD-1 1210, that is an enrollment hold on new patients as we perform an assessment of the compound's profile in totality. We have made no further decisions related to the compound. I take as your question was a hypothetical. But going forward, across programs, including GITR, OX40, et cetera, we will look at multiple potential partners in terms of PD-1s and PD-L1s.","In terms of non-small cell lung cancer, you're right. It's a dynamic field that change rapidly. Certainly in the first-line setting, testing for a biomarker and levels of expression look to be important for PD-1 therapies and then the chemotherapy combinations as well. In terms of our own data in lung cancer that we're busy gathering at the moment across our collaborations, we will have patients and many patients who have not experienced any immunotherapy yet. So, we are positioned to be able to answer the question of whether or not we add to PD-1 activity in those settings. We're perfectly positioned to answer that question actually.","Ying Huang - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you, Steve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ian Somaiya with BMO Capital. Please state your question.","M. Ian Somaiya - BMO Capital Markets (United States)","Thanks. Just had a couple of questions. First one on Jakafi. I guess after having five years of the myelofibrosis market all to yourselves, just trying to get a better understanding of what the future growth opportunity is within that indication. And how we should think about momelotinib if the Phase 1\/2 data is reflective of the drugs commercial profile?","And then secondly on IDO, Steven, Reid, maybe you could just speak to how predictive melanoma data has been when considering success in solid tumors? I know you can't speak to your own data, but maybe just the IO field overall whether it's marketed drugs or other drugs in development that would just guide us to how to think about how other drugs' success in melanoma and whether there were specific tumor types that tended to respond similarly?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Hi. It's Barry. So, to answer your first question about Jakafi's growth, well, the way we look at it is that we really only penetrated myelofibrosis about one-third of the prevalent patient population. So, we think we have an upside there.","In terms of, if momelotinib comes to market, there's a couple different scenarios. One is that they in fact have a second line indication after Jakafi, and we really don't think that this is going to have an impact on us. If they come to market in a frontline setting, where Jakafi is currently approved, in the way I think about it is that we have long-term data with long-term spleen response. We have improved symptoms, and we have an overall survival advantage, and we don't cause neurotoxicity.","So, I think our competitive profile again will match up very well with Jakafi. And we continue to see not only are we adding more patients every single quarter, just like we did this quarter in myelofibrosis, but in fact, those patients continue to benefit for a long time on Jakafi.","Reid M. Huber, PhD - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Ian, this is Reid. I'll take your second question. I think as a field we've come to appreciate that melanoma is a very attractive proving ground to test immune-based therapies. And that's true across all classes. It is a more inflamed tumor type. So, there's an active component of T-cell that certainly has a high mutational burden, and all those things lend itself to being perhaps a lower bar, if you will, for immune-based therapies.","Exactly how that predicts response across other tumor types or whether it does, is probably a class-specific question. It certainly has shed new light I think from the field to understand which other tumor types may also harbor some of those characteristics of an inflamed phenotype, and we can think about tumor types like bladder, lung, head and neck, renal cell, all in a new light because of the groundbreaking work that's happened in melanoma.","As we look at the emerging IDO data, certainly, the signals that we reported at ESMO that formed the basis of our Phase 3 ECHO-301 program are important, I think, to having a de-risking of the (33:42) melanoma. How or whether that translates to other tumor types is all going to be dependent on the data that we're generating, but it, I would say, increases our confidence, doesn't decrease our confidence certainly. And coupled with the safety profile, if we think about the emerging doublet landscape and some of these other tumor types, unattractive safety profile is going to be more, not less important as these therapies move into early line and frontline settings. So, I think we're encouraged based on those data. We're excited by the program, but we still have to generate the data to speak precisely to what the opportunity may be outside of melanoma.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Simos Simeonidis with RBC Capital Markets. Please state your question.","Simos Simeonidis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just to clarify in terms of news flow, what we can expect for epacadostat announcements. You mentioned that we're going to see additional proof-of-concept data sometime first half of next year. But is it still the case that we may see an announcement or announcements about your plans of which tumor types you may go into Phase 3 earlier than that? And secondly, could it be the case where you can have multiple announcements, so for example, you can say, we're going to go into lung and then a month later, you say we're going to go into this other tumor type or will it all be one announcement for your Phase 3 plan?","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Okay. Herv\u00e9 here. Let me try to take that. I mean we have tried to describe it in the past and we are precisely where \u2013 the way we describe it which is, obviously, is the disclosure of the data in conferences is not entirely under our control, because the date of these conferences are set with large intervals in between. If we are at the point of making a decision or making a decision to go to Phase 3, we think it's an event that should be disclosed. So, we would, at this time, announce it as we have done, I think, if I remember well in the case of the melanoma study. And that's really what's driving the process.","I don't think we would be in a position where all the data from all the Phase 2 are going to be available at the same time. In fact, we are just starting some new indication in some of this combination. So, you cannot expect that all of these studies are going to close at one point and then, booms the whole set of data will be available. I think it will be more in batches as we are progressing through the first half of next year and that's \u2013 I think, that's really the situation we are facing here.","Simos Simeonidis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. Perfect. And, finally, has there been any impact in your Phase 2 trials by the durvalumab partial hold?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Hi. It's Steven Stein. So, in terms of head and neck cancer and what's happened there, it's something we were aware of. We obviously have a clinical collaboration with AstraZeneca. The impact on the protocols will involve wording changes for people to exercise appropriate caution for things like, for example, if the tumor is close to a major vessel, in addition, if there's an underlying bleeding disorder. But in terms of our actual protocols and program, that continues unabated. It's just learnings from their experience, and an avoidance to try and have that toxicity not happen on our program.","Simos Simeonidis - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Geoff Meacham with Barclays. Please state your question.","Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Hi, all. This is Evan Seigerman on for Geoff. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up on kind of the IDO timelines in lung. So, I believe last week Merck mentioned that it would be in a position to make kind of the go\/no-go decision on Phase 3 by mid-2017. Is this still in line with your assumptions? And how often and how much do you look up the data on an ongoing basis to help you make this choice? Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. As we said \u2013 I would take that one again. As we said, the ability to make a decision is not just based on the response rate data. It's based on situational response. It's based on the biomarker, specifically in lung cancer where, as you know, things have changed a little bit over the past few months with new emerging data from PD-1 as the single agent. So, I think Merck comment about mid-2017, we speak about the first half of 2017, so that's probably very much of overlapping from that standpoint. We don't know exactly when it would be because, as I said, I mean this is a data that is emerging.","The database that will be sort of populated to make the decision with the full analysis is not yet populated, so we don't have access to that data with a full set of biomarker, situational response and response rate yet. And when we have it, is really where we would be able to move to the next step.","Evan Seigerman - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking the question. I appreciate it.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company. Please state your question.","Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC","Good morning. Another question on epacadostat, I guess, for Herv\u00e9. From the time you would make a go decision on a pivotal study, how long would it take to actually start such a trial? And would that change if you were doing it with or without a partner? I ask because, I think, it took a good six months to nine months in melanoma, and I'm wondering if you could shorten that timeline.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. I think the decision to work with a partner or not is really something that we are looking at this in a natural way that we tend to like to work with a partner. It has a small financial impact on the cost of the study, but it's also a way to learn and benefit from their own scientific understanding of their own products. So there \u2013 it's not just a financial benefit of working with a partner. There is a little bit of a shared scientific information. If for any reason, a partner would rather not be part of the study, which could happen for budget reason or for any other sort of external reason, we are always open to do the study by ourselves.","In terms of the timing, I think, last time the announcement was made at the point where we were in the planning stage, so maybe it took a little bit of time to go through the entire planning, protocol writing then, execution. In general, what we plan to see the window between the decision to do a Phase 3 and the first patient in the Phase 3 to be less than six months, I mean that would be an industry standard.","Eric Schmidt, Ph.D. - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please state your question.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Hi there. I was wondering if we could talk a little bit about R&D. I know you've increased how much you're (41:16), just curious where you're spending, where you hadn't accounted before where you're placing more dollars. Thank you.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","On the component of the R&D spending, I mean, we are a company that is fully integrated. So, we have a relatively large team working in chemistry and biology and doing discovery every day. So, that's a piece of it. I don't know if we have given details on the split between the different cost structure, but you can imagine that that part is mostly internally cost. So, they are basically head count that are working on our projects.","And then on the D side, the development side, Steven Stein's group, we have a mix of internal cost, so we have a team of people that has been increased fairly substantially over the past three years. And we have obviously number of cost that are study related. So, they are directly attached to the number of patients that we are accruing in our studies. So, that's sort of the way it works. So, what it gives us is some flexibility understanding depending on the cycle of studies. So, as we discussed earlier, if we were initiating a number of Phase 3 studies, we could do it, we have the infrastructure to do it and that would increase the external cost attached to this Phase 3 study. And if we have less concomitant studies ongoing at some point in time, then the external cost can go down. And we have created in our system the flexibility to do that.","The growth of our current R&D budget is mostly driven by the external cost related to the study, as we have now built a team that is of a good size to be able to manage this project. So, I guess that's what I can say about the components of the R&D budget.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Great. And then, just kind of the two programs that don't get as much attention, that's GVHD and alopecia. Can you just remind us of the dosing and sort of briefly what are you looking for in the data to show that there's a strong signal? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi. It's Steven Stein answering your question. On graft-versus-host disease there are a few entities there. There's acute graft-versus-host disease and chronic graft-versus-host disease, and then there's steroid-refractory components and then there's a first-line entity in acute that's not yet steroid-refractory. So, you just have to be careful about the entities you're talking about, and the clinical manifestations in each of those can be different. And because of acuity of disease and needing to control it early that can also mean slightly different things.","We have not yet disclosed the dosing we're using in any of these programs yet. But when the study starts and go up on ClinicalTrials.gov, you know more information will be available. But they're not \u2013 they're in keeping of what we know about ruxolitinib's profile and what it can do. For alopecia areata, just to remind you, that's a topical ruxolitinib formulation, a cream and would need going forward potentially more dose range and work to work out exactly the dose to deliver there.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. And then, just a final question. Any insights you can give us on baricitinib, obviously it's a large market opportunity and I think the ranges out there are pretty broad. Has Lilly kind of provided any kind of guidance on how they're thinking about competing in that market? Is there going to be a price to take share strategy or more of a premium pricing, how should we think about where it falls into the regimens available? Thanks.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Thanks. Herv\u00e9 here. Thanks for the question. It's difficult to answer because our partner Lilly is really driving a lot of the strategy for the launch and they have not been communicating, obviously, all the details of their strategy. So, it will not be appropriate for me to speak about it. What we see that the profile of baricitinib from the multiple Phase 3 studies that have been performed is certainly very good when compared to the TNS, so that's certainly something that will be core to the strategy of the product because as far as the medical profile is driving a lot of the decision that will be made there. We know the review process is ongoing and the target date that has been discussed is early next year. So, that's really what we can say on baricitinib.","Liisa A. Bayko - JMP Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot for the question.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Abrahams with Jefferies. Please state your question.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking my question and congrats on the strong quarter. On 2016 Jakafi growth, wonder if you can talk about the drivers for fourth quarter growth. I think based on the midpoint of your guidance, it looks like you're expecting both absolute and percentage quarter-over-quarter increase to be less in fourth quarter versus third quarter, as compared to third quarter versus second quarter, just by a price increase that you took at the end of the third quarter. It sounds like there weren't any onetime factors that contributed to third quarter growth. So, I'm just wondering if you are expecting maybe lesser pricing pull through, perhaps, a slight waning of demand growth or maybe you're just being conservative.","And then separately on the development side, where do you foresee epacadostat potentially fitting in relative to checkpoint plus chemo combos, and just wondering if you could potentially move into \u2013 straight into any Phase 3s on top of chemo and a PD-1, if you wanted to go that route, or would you need additional Phase 2 work before you took that step? Thanks.","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Thanks, Brian. This is Barry. I'll answer the first question. We think it's prudent. Our guidance going forward $850 million represents a 5% quarter-over-quarter growth and goes up to 7% quarter-over-quarter growth at $855 million. So, we think that's good. Mostly, the fourth quarter is one of those quarters that you don't know exactly what's going to happen. Lots of vacation days and time off for healthcare professionals and for our staff in November and December. And historically, Jakafi has had very good fourth quarters and some soft fourth quarters. So, that's why we're putting guidance out like that. But we still have lots of enthusiasm for continued growth in both MS and PD.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Ron, hi. It's Steven Stein. Related to the chemotherapy question both in combination with checkpoint inhibitors, there are at least two questions that we will answer in our clinical program going forward. One is does a PD-1 or PD-L1 plus IDO perform similarly or better to a PD-1 or PD-L1 combo plus chemo. And then the other one we're very interested in answering and will begin clinical work shortly is adding IDO to a chemotherapy combination in multiple different histologies and multiple different chemotherapy combinations. There's a lot of good signs there around what chemotherapy can potentially do in terms of neoantigen release, et cetera. But that latter question, we still need more clinical work to answer to get to meet your question.","In terms of the tolerability profile, that's something else which we'll, obviously, carefully examine because the PD-1 plus IDO combo, as you know, and we've just presented updated data at ESMO, very well tolerated and then a different tolerance for a chemotherapy combination. So to be continued and to be answered over the ensuing year.","Brian Abrahams - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","Our next question comes from Reni Benjamin with Raymond James. Please state your question.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions, and congratulations on a great quarter. Maybe just going back to epacadostat, can you give us a sense as to what studies we might see first? And is it as easy as kind of going back and looking at when these studies had started or are there other different enrollment challenges that are taking place with a variety of studies?","The other question is again related to the PD-1 inhibitor. Steve, did enrollment complete, and now you're assessing the efficacy of the drug or was there some sort of signal that forced you to stop mid-enrollment? And, I guess, just a high level question for Herv\u00e9. Just given the current climate regarding price increases, can you maybe talk a little bit about how you are planning to or handling this going forward? And are there any rumblings from pairs, or does that really just happen once there is a competitor on the market? Thanks.","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Ren, hi. It's Steven Stein. I'll take your first two questions, then hand it over to Herv\u00e9. The first one I'm not going to answer satisfactory for you because it depends on histology and when they come in, in terms of the data set. We will and we've said repeatedly across our collaborations, we're studying more than a dozen tumors. We will enroll north of 600 patients this year and have very healthy cohorts for each of those to analyze.","Some areas are more competitive than others. These are known areas like lung cancer can be more competitive than other histologies. But I'm not going to comment as to what datasets will come in first before others. And as Herv\u00e9 said earlier, we'll present them appropriately. In terms of your question related our PD-1 1210 inhibitor, the dose escalation phase is completed, and we have information to make decisions on what to go forward in terms of dose expansion, and that's what we're looking at the totality of the profile at the moment. I'll hand it to Herv\u00e9.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. No, the question about the climate and price, I think again I mean back to what I said at the beginning of the call, I think, our view is that innovation is what creates value. It creates value for society, it creates value for patients obviously first by where we can help, and you see that now. You see a number of tumor type where basically at diagnosis just a few years ago people were looking at palliative way to treat these patients and where now there are optionalities to potentially have some curative of very long-term responses, and that's really what's driving most \u2013 all of our efforts in bringing this new drugs to market. What it does to society is an incredible amount of savings on the cost of treating cancer. And that's really where the economics work really, really well, is that today most of the cost of treating cancer, 80% of it in the U.S. and around the same number in Europe are not coming from medicines. They're coming from the rest of the cost in surgery and palliative care, in radiation therapy, et cetera, et cetera.","So, the model we are pursuing is the model that would be, over time, obviously building for us an important source of new revenues through innovative products and at the same time, being able to make it in such a way where the healthcare system will benefit from this innovation. And we see that. I mean, I know there is a lot of noise about the way people look at some of the cost issues, but the reality is that we see already that when products are truly effective, they are in fact cost savings for the healthcare system.","In the case of Jakafi and myelofibrosis, it's a situation where we are in a position where the coverage in the U.S. is very broad, and we don't see a lot of hurdles there. And obviously, it's based on what Barry was describing where the symptomatic benefit and now the survival benefit is what established for this product.","Reni Benjamin - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Lawson with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please state your question.","Peter Lawson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Just I guess a question for Barry or Steven, just around the ASH data, what could we see \u2013 it looks like what Jakafi five-year data GVHD, any color around that data?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Yeah. Hi, Peter. It's Steven Stein. So, as you know, the American Society of Hematology abstract is published in the next 24 hours, 48 hours and are embargoed until then. So, I can't give you color around the data other than to point to you what we said in the actual presentation, which is the pooled analysis of COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II overall survival data in myelofibrosis will be presented as part of our numerous presentations at ASH. And then additionally, 39110, our selective JAK1 inhibitor proof-of-concept study in graft-versus-host disease will also be presented there. So, as soon as the abstracts are live, you can look at the data set, and then the actual presentations. Can't provide more color at this point.","Peter Lawson - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey","Got you. And then, just on the earlier IO pipeline, GITR and OX40, when can we see data in those molecules?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","It's Steven again. The GITR only dosed the second half of this year and OX40 is about to dose. So, we will be conducting those studies as efficiently as possible, but you are looking a year plus ahead to see data related to the Phase 1 experience for those compounds. Thanks.","Operator","Our next questions comes from Alethia Young with Credit Suisse. Please state your question.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congrats on the quarter. And it's probably for Barry, as it relates for Jakafi, with the broader guidelines, is it a matter of like finding the patients or just educating the doctors who are reviewing the charts around that opportunity?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Sure. So, for myelofibrosis, it is sometimes difficult. Myelofibrosis patients obviously are seen by hematologist\/oncologist in the community and they may not see them as frequently as they do some metastatic lung cancer patients for example. So, to recognize that these patients \u2013 that patient that they might call low risk, let's say, but are actually high risk and they need to be treated right away, sometimes that's very difficult for them to assess. So, our educational efforts \u2013 some of our educational efforts are focused on that to make sure that physicians who are treating patients with myelofibrosis are appropriately assessing the risk that these patients are under and the NCCN Guidelines reinforce that.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then just on the momelotinib and looking at your longer term data in COMFORT, do you think that like the long-term data is something that is important to doctors admitting that let's say, a bulk case (57:20) scenario comes out from momelotinib where the data looks like it supports first-line therapy. Do you think that like having that longer term data is something that's very important and relevant in momelotinib would have to be held to the same standard?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Yes. Exactly. That's why I keep on saying our clinical profile matches up very well. We have long-term spleen response data, long-term safety data. We improved symptoms to a great degree for these patients. And in fact, we have a 30% reduction in the risk of debt. And there is no endpoint in the momelotinib studies either SIMPLIFY-1 or SIMPLIFY-2 for overall survival. So, we think we're in good shape.","Alethia Young - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Michael Schmidt with Leerink Partners. Please state your question.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the follow-up. I had a couple additional questions. One on duration of therapy in MF, in clinical practice. Has that been similar to what's been seen in long-term follow-up of the COMFORT trials?","Barry P. Flannelly - Incyte Corp.","Well, so for myelofibrosis in the COMFORT trials, what you're talking about is that 50% of patients stayed on for three years. So, while in the everyday setting, not in the clinical trial setting, it's less than that, but it's hard to predict. Patients stay on therapy for a long time, we have some percentage of patients who stay on therapy for a very long time and benefit greatly from it. So, we've never really talked about the true persistency, but it's more than 12 months.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks. And then, one on the FGFR inhibitor, the question there is what are the Phase 2 studies that you have initiated there, whether those could be registration-enabling?","Steven H. Stein - Incyte Corp.","Michael, hi. It's Steven Stein responding. So, there are robust large Phase 2 studies of approximately 100 patients each. They'll capture response rates along with duration of response. There are multiple precedence, both in the United States and in Europe for approvals, with good high response rates that are durable. And the U.S. would be under accelerated approval conditions, in Europe, under conditional approval conditions, for which you would then have to do confirmatory studies. So, it'll be a review issue based on the efficacy data we see, but there is potential.","Michael Schmidt - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. And one on capmatinib, the MET-inhibitor with Novartis, where it looks like they're expecting filing in 2018. I was wondering whether it's known, which specific indication that could be in?

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host Ms. Pamela Murphy, Vice President Investor Relations and Communications.  Thank you; Ms. Murphy, you may now begin.","Pamela Murphy","Good morning and welcome to Incyte's fourth quarter 2012 conference call.  With me today are Paul Friedman, Incyte's President and Chief Executive Officer; Jim Daly, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Dave Hastings, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Levy, Executive Vice President, Chief Drug Development and Medical Officer.","The agenda for the call is as follows.  Paul will begin with a brief overview of the quarter and full year, particularly regarding the launch of Jakafi and share what we expect in terms of product revenues for 2013.  Jim will follow with a full update on the launch and ongoing commercialization of Jakafi.  Paul will then provide more detail on the pipeline followed by Dave who will describe our fourth quarter results and 2013 [Sic] financial guidance.  After that we will open up the call for Q&A.","Before beginning, we like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements, including statements regarding our expectations for the commercialization of Jakafi, our development plans, and other indications, and our 2013 financial guidance.  These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30th, 2012, and from time-to-time in our SEC documents.  Paul?","Paul Friedman","Good morning.  We'll start the call talking about Jakafi.  But you can see from our financial guidance for R&D expenses that we're investing in much more than one product.  Thanks to our extensive R&D efforts we have a robust pipeline that includes additional potential indications for Jakafi, as well as potential indications in inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis for our second JAK1, JAK2 inhibitor Baricitinib, which is being developed as part of our partnership with Lilly, who are also continuing to invest in our early stage program including our proprietary JAK1 inhibitors.","We're confident that our pipeline will enable us to succeed as a growing biopharmaceutical company.  That said, we certainly appreciate you wanting to hear upfront about the status of Jakafi for myelofibrosis.  In 2012, we build a solid foundation for Jakafi as the first approved treatment for patients with intermediate or high risk MF.  Through the year, we saw consistent and growing number of physicians use Jakafi and we saw consistent and growing number of patients benefit from treatment with Jakafi.","Given these trends, we expect to see steady growth in treating this MF population over the next several years, and for 2013 we've set our net product revenue guidance in the range of $210 million to $225 million.  This range reflects our expectations of the ongoing evolution of the myelofibrosis market including more physicians initiating Jakafi; renew appropriate patients and more physicians and patients successfully continuing Jakafi therapy as long as they experience clinical benefit.","I'm going to now turn the call to Jim, who will further describe how our guidance represents a continuing sustainable demand.","Jim Daly","Thank you Paul, and good morning everyone.  Our growth strategy for Jakafi MF to add new patient starts at a health rate, while keeping patients on treatment longer, yielded strong results in the fourth quarter.  I'd like to thank our commercial and medical teams for their tireless efforts in educating physicians on the optimal use of Jakafi to benefit patients with intermediate or high risk MF.","In terms of our quarter-over-quarter growth, when you exclude the $9 million in deferred revenue recognized in the third quarter, the adjusted net revenues grew by 25%, with the following components of growth.  Underlying demand, as measured by dispensed bottles grew 17%, inventory 4%, price 4%.  In the fourth quarter, new patient starts remained relatively stable, and our favorability to revenue guidance is attributable to early signs of improved persistence.","We continue to see increasing use of lower dosage strengths, which are driven by physicians individualizing treatment, in particular by starting patients at appropriate doses and titrating downward as necessary.  Our market research indicates that dose titration leads to increased persistence.  The increased use of lower dosage is a direct result of our educational efforts in increased physician experience with Jakafi.  And we expect this trend to continue in 2013, driven by rapid and appropriate follow-up by our field sales and medical teams with new prescribers, enhanced outreach the patients through our IncyteCARES Patient Support Program, and specialty pharmacies, and the publication of additional dose titration data from ASH.","ASH was an important meeting for Jakafi.  Not only did the meeting present additional new data to support individualized dosing, but also presented data on overall survival.  This new information should help to motivate physicians to indentify additional appropriate MF patients in the practice and to work to keep them on treatment.","Additionally, we now have data from our studies of patients with low platelet counts and we expect additional information in our label sometime in the second quarter that will provide greater clarity on starting dose for these patients.","Our 2013 guidance reflects our confidence that we've substantial growth opportunities and meaningful catalyst at both the physician and the patient level.  12 months post launch we continue to see a steady increase in new prescribers and we continue to see an increase in the number of physicians prescribing Jakafi for multiple patients, with one-third of prescribers having written for two or more patients.  Currently, roughly have of new patient starts come from new prescribers with the remaining half coming from repeat prescribers.  We are confident in our ability to continue to increase both breadth and depth of physician prescribing in 2013.  At the patient level, we continue to believe that the total population of patients with MF is between 16,000 and 18,500.  And our addressable population of diagnosed intermediate or high risk MF patients is approximately 15,000.","Growth opportunities at the patient level include the following.  Educate and motivate physicians to identify appropriate new patients including, those who are Jakavi patient negative, but are still indicated and will benefit from Jakafi.  Restart discontinued patients at a lower dose where appropriate and maintain patients on Jakafi longer to individualize dosing and titration especially during the first 8 to 12 weeks of treatment.","Our guidance of $210 million to $225 million reflects consisting growth in dispense bottles, largely driven by new patients, and a realistically achievable improvement in length of treatment for continuing patients versus 2012.  Furthermore, we anticipate that these market dynamics will enable consisting growth for Jakafi well beyond 2013 and at least until our next potential growth driver the PV indication.","With that I'll turn it back to Paul.","Paul Friedman","","Okay.  Thank you, Jim.  While we're the first approved therapy in myelofibrosis, Jakafi has potential in additional hematologic settings, as well as in solid tumors.  The most advanced of these settings and trials are in polycythemia vera and in pancreatic cancer.  And we're studying Jakafi in two Phase III trials in PV.","The first trail response being conducted under an SPA in partnership with Novartis is now fully recruited, which keeps us on track to submit a supplemental NDA in the first half of 2014.  The FDA has granted fast track designation for PV and that's specifically for the treatment of patients who are resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea.","The second trial in PV is called RELIEF, and it's evaluating symptomatic benefit.  The study is not required for FDA approval but we intend to submit results to support labeling claims on symptomatic benefit in PV.  And beyond MF and PV, we're looking forward to results in the second half of 2013 from an already fully recruited Phase II trial studying Jakafi in patients with pancreatic cancer in which overall survival is the primary endpoint.","Looking at our second JAK1, JAK2 inhibitor Baricitinib, which is licensed to Lilly, we see significant potential value in multiple chronic inflammatory conditions starting with rheumatoid arthritis.  The Phase III RA program began in November of 2012 at the time that the results of the Phase IIb trial were being presented at the American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting.","These results coupled with a well-designed Phase III program give us confidence that baricitinib has the potential to be positioned as best-in-class in RA.  Baricitinib is also being explored for its potential to treat psoriasis and diabetic nephropathy and Lilly is conducting Phase II trials for both conditions.","Our knowledge of and commitment for the JAK inhibitor space extends well beyond these two compounds.  We look forward to advancing our earlier stage JAK1 inhibitors, such as our compound INCB39110 for which we're conducting proof of concept studies in myelofibrosis, rheumatoid arthritis, and psoriasis.  We expect to further expand the therapeutic potential of the JAK inhibitor class as a whole and ensure that Incyte retains a leading position in this space.","In addition to our JAK programs we have other compounds and developments such as our earlier stage oncology programs for c-MET or c-MET inhibitor partnered with Novartis and the Indoleamine Dioxygenase inhibitor in development for melanoma and ovarian cancer.","We continue to maintain a robust focus discovery program that examines three to four targets at a time, primarily focused on oncology with some potential overlap in inflammation.","Given the depth of our pipeline and the productivity of our R&D team, we believe it's important to continue our investments in both the existing and future programs, which should lead to important new medicines.","I'm now going to turn things over to Dave, who will walk us through some of the financials, including more details of 2013 expenses.","Dave Hastings","Thanks Paul.  Good morning, everybody.","I will start today by discussing Q4 results and then I will review our 2013 guidance.","Let's begin with cash.  We ended the year with $228 million in cash and investments.  This amount excludes the $50 million milestone paid by Lilly in January related to the initiation of Phase III studies for baricitinib.","Now moving to Jakafi, we recorded $43.3 million of fourth quarter and $136 million of full year 2012 net product revenues.  Efficiently we recorded $3.7 million in Jakavi product royalties from Novartis for sales outside the United States.","Our gross-to-net adjustment for product revenue recognized was approximately $3.2 million or about 7% for the fourth quarter and $10.7 million or approximately 7.5% for the full year 2012.  As a reminder our gross-to-net adjustment includes the following fees to our specialty pharmacies, rebates the governmental payers, our share of the doughnut hole for Medicare Part B patients, copay assistance to eligible privately-insured patients, and any product returns.","Our cost of goods sold for both the fourth quarter and full year 2012 was immaterial as our starting finished goods inventory was previously expensed as R&D prior to FDA approval.  In terms of operating expenses, SG&A was within expectations, while R&D expense came in below our guidance.","Now, I'm moving to 2013 financial guidance.  As Paul mentioned our Jakafi net revenue is expected to be in the range of $210 million to $225 million.  In terms of our gross-to-net adjustment we expect that to range from 8% to 9% in 2013.  Note that because of our portion of the Medicare Donut Hole the first quarter's gross-to-net may be in the high end of that range.","In terms of contract revenues we expect $66 million in revenue from the amortization of the upfront payments received under the Novartis and Lilly agreements.  For milestones, we expect to receive $60 million under the Novartis collaboration for EU pricing approval for Jakafi in specific countries.","In terms of royalty revenues, while we're not providing 2013 guidance, now that we're receiving royalties from Novartis, we're able to describe the overall royalty arrangement we have with them.  Our tiered royalty rate from Novartis ranges from the high-teens to the mid 20s on net sale of the Jakafi outside the U.S. Additionally when Novartis receives pricing and reimbursement approval in specific European countries, we will begin to record tiered, low single-digit royalties payable to Novartis on net Jakafi sales in the U.S.  These royalties will be recorded in cost of goods sold.  Therefore, we expect the total cost of goods sold as a percentage of net Jakafi sales in 2013 will be about 2%.","At steady state, when we're using the inventory that has not been previously expensed, we expect cost of goods sold to be in the range of 4% to 6%, which includes our royalty payments to Novartis.","In terms of 2013 R&D expense we expect that to range from $260 million to 270 million.  This includes non-cash stock comp expense of approximately $25 million to $28 million. Our increase in R&D expense from 2012 is primarily due to higher co-development costs for Phase III studies for Baricitinib and RA, the expansion of our proprietary JAK1 inhibitor program, and increased investment in medical affairs for our continuing medical education supported Jakafi.","In terms of SG&A expense, we expect that to range from $100 million to $110 million.  This includes non-cash stock comp expense of $14 million to $17 million.  The increase is primarily due to increased sales and marketing investment in support of Jakafi.  We expect our interest expense this year to be $47 million, including a non-cash charge of $28 million related primarily to the amortization of the discount on the 4.75% Convertible Senior Notes.","So with our strong cash position, and now multiple sources of cash flow, we believe that we're in a strong position to fund continued growth.","And so with that, Paul I'll turn the call back to you.","Paul Friedman","Okay.  So before we open the call to questions, I just want to remind you of our goal for Incyte over the next five years that is to build a sustainable, diversified, high growth pharmaceutical company.","As we enter 2013, we're confident that we've the increasing financial and human resources we need to execute on this vision and we believe will drive substantial value for patients, doctors, our employees, and our shareholders.","So now we will move to Q&A and open the call for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.  We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session.  (Operator Instructions) Thank you.  Our first question is from the line of Matt Roden of UBS.  Please proceed with your question.","Matt Roden - UBS","Thanks for taking the question.  In your prepared remarks, you spoke about early signs of improved persistence and your guidance has realistically achievable goals in patient retention 2013.  Can you be a little more specific as to what you're seeing in the clinic now and whether or not this relates to improved patient mix vis-\u00e0-vis the initial bolus of high needed patients and whether to what extent is related to the dosing information you guys had at ASH and how these factor into Q1 2013?","Jim Daly","Hi, Matt, this is Jim.  Matt, I think the best single indicator that physicians are becoming more facile with the dose is looking at the dose mix.  And we've seen a steady increase in the utilization of the 10 milligram and 5 milligram tablets.  As a matter of fact, for the first time recently on a year to-date basis we've seen 10 milligrams becoming the most frequently dispensed dosage form.","So that's probably our single most tangible piece of evidence that doctors are responding to the titration information from ASH and using it to incorporate more individualized dosing into practice.","Matt Roden - UBS","And I presume that is sort of correlating with lower discontinuation rates over time?","Jim Daly","It's there, its preliminary, Matt, but again the favorability we saw in the fourth quarter versus our guidance that was not attributable to new patient starts that was attributable to patients staying on treatment longer.","Matt Roden - UBS","And then on the pipeline, we're seeing an expansion of investigator sponsored trials Jakafi in various liquid and solid tumors in addition to your own pancreatic trial, Rich or Paul can you speak to with respect to the pancreatic trial you've an overall survival endpoint, so obviously you think that this has a direct antitumor effect.  Can you speak to the mechanism around why we should see an antitumor effect with JAK in addition and if you actually in the end don't get an antitumor effect if you did see an effect on sort of supportive care type of endpoints would that be sufficient for taking it forward in solid or liquid tumors?","Rich Levy","Hi, Matt, this is Rich.  So the rationale for the antitumor effect in pancreatic cancer relates to the basic mechanism whereby, which STAT3 phosphorylation for example is reduced because if you inhibit signaling through JAK it's going to reduce STAT3 phosphorylation.  And there are good animal models in pancreatic cancer showing that that is a key mechanism.  Now most pancreatic cancers have other imitations, but somehow in ways that have not yet been defined, these work in synergy such that by inhibiting STAT3 phosphorylation you get an antitumor effect and that's has been demonstrated both in cell culture as well as in xenograft models.","Now the other aspect that we're talking about is whether this will prolong survival as a result of improvement in the metabolic status so called treatment of cancer for cachexia.  We think both mechanisms may be applied here, if we can increase survival in a solid tumor like pancreatic cancer, I don't think it's critical why that happens as long as you're increasing survival and pancreatic cancer is kind of our model solid tumor disease here, but this seemed like it can be applied to a number of other solid tumors including potentially breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and potentially others as well.","Matt Roden - UBS","So have you given though to in the cases didn't show a frank overall survival benefit, but you did see improvement in various symptoms, symptomatology, would that be sufficient to continue development?","Rich Levy","Well, possibly, we haven't really considered that per se.  I mean there is a possibility that you've survival trend in the studies, which is a privatized studies, just to small to actually prove it in which case that would be something.  But remember that we really set that President here on oncology with development of drugs related to symptomatic improvement as we saw in myelofibrosis in being the first approval based on the patient reported outcome.  And the oncology division of FDA is very amenable to these types of approaches in a situation where you're making a profound impact.  There can't be a trivial change in the symptomatology but when you've a profound impact as we did in myelofibrosis that is an option.  But whether that would be where we would then spend our money and resources remains to be seen when we actually see the data sometime in the second half of this year.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Boris Peaker of Oppenheimer.  Please proceed with your question.","Boris Peaker - Oppenheimer","And also I want to add my congratulation for the excellent result.  Now, just a general question for Jim.  Could you update us on the progress of advancing Jakafi into less advanced patient particularly in the community setting?  What are the kind of feedbacks that you're getting?","Jim Daly","","Yes, Boris, it is mixed.  And I want to be straight with you.  I think using intermediate one is probably still the exception rather than the rule.  But we're seeing some use in less obvious, less severe patients, and we think that bodes very well for the long-term.  Right now, though we're seeing still substantial opportunity in the high risk patients.  So, our primary focus right now is to engineer successful trial in the high-risk patients and earn the right to go back in and ask for less severe patients and we're confident that we're going to be able to do that overtime.","Boris Peaker - Oppenheimer","I see.  And so then, in your 2013 guidance, I guess what fraction of the growth do you anticipate to come from expanding to new patients and less advanced patients versus may be just change in duration of treatment of existing patients?","Jim Daly","Sure.  Again, I think the guidance is our best quantitative description of what's going to happen next year.  But qualitatively, the two key drivers in the forecast are new patient starts and length of treatment, and we do assume a modest, realistic, achievable increase in persistence.  We're also assuming that we'll see a very slight slowdown in a number of new patient starts month over month and that reflects the fact that it becomes more difficult to get the less severe patients on treatment.  But our forecast does assume that we will be able to penetrate into the moderately severe patient population and maintain a robust supply of new patients.","Boris Peaker - Oppenheimer","And the new patient starts that you just mentioned potential is slowing down a bit.  You think that the ASH data would really help you to kind of push the accelerator further on these patients, and if so, how long based on your kind of estimates do you think would take to disseminate this ASH data to the community setting?","Jim Daly","Sure.  If we're able to maintain the same rate of new patient starts that would be an upside to our forecast.  And I do think that it is a plausible scenario that the overall survival data from ASH could enable us to do that.  Now the local ASH meeting, the best of ASH and the ASH update that takes place in the academic medical centers, those have just started, just wrapped up, and generally we're very pleased with the awareness level of the ASH new data.  Some evidence of that is seen in the number of inquiries that our medical department is receiving, regarding subjects like overall survival and subjects like dose titration.  So clearly there is an awareness of the data and there is an interest on the part of physicians to incorporate it into their practice.  So we're encouraged by what we're seeing from ASH today.","Paul Friedman","Can I -- I just also add that our intent is to publish, in a peer review journal the data from ASH.  And once that has happened, those papers can be handed out to physicians under current guidelines.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Cory Kasimov, JP Morgan.  Please proceed with your question.","Matt Lowe - JP Morgan","Hi it's actually Matt Lowe in for Cory today.  Just a couple of questions.  First one is on, are there any specific strategy you're using to get the dosing message out there, and then on the survival message, have you noticed a change or a more receptive physician audience since ASH?  Thanks.","Paul Friedman","Part one; we were certainly using scientific exchange, the primary channel for communicating dose information.  Certainly I represented that reinforcing the information is in the current product label, and to the extent the information is not in the label that is being communicated via the medical exchange, CME et cetera.  Regarding the response, the overall survival data, I'd say absolutely.  I think the consistency of the data in COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II, is building confidence on the part of physicians that the product is working to treat the underlying disease and providing a profound benefit to the patients, above and beyond symptoms.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is coming from the line of Rachel McMinn of Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I've got a question.  One, I'm hoping you can help us understand what the hurdle is for the futility analysis for Jakafi in the pancreatic cancer study.  And then, I also just wanted to get a sense in terms of sequential trends.  I know you're not giving quarterly guidance but Q1 tends to be seasonally weak across the board for oncology drugs from insurance based issues and I'm just wondering if you expect a similar trend for Jakafi next quarter?","Paul Friedman","Well Rich Levy do.","Rich Levy","On the futility we're already past that and the study was not stopped for futility.  That could potentially have happened if the conditional power was less than 30% and that was not the case and that's basically all we know.  At this point in time the study remains blinded.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I'm sorry, just a follow-up to that.  Sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off but just a follow-up Rich, is the expectation around six months survival for this population?","Rich Levy","","Well, so the historical data in this patient population is about 3 to 4 months survival.  These are second line patients.","Rachel McMinn - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","Second line, okay.","","Rich Levy","It's not clear whether or not the historical data will match with the control -- what the survival is in the control ARM of this study as each individual study can enroll slightly different patient population.  So the important thing would be comparing treatment with Jakafi to those who were treated with placebo with everybody getting capecitabine.  So, it's really about the hazard ratio, how much longer they live relatively than absolute but we'll just have to wait and see what those numbers look like.","Paul Friedman","And Rachel regarding the seasonality you're exactly right particularly with products that are on exposed to patients restarting their deductibles has tampered our expectations for January and I'm glad to report that we're very encouraged by what we saw in January and we're confident that we will be here when we give you the first quarter results being able to saying that our results are consistent.  So we're very pleased with the way we came through January.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Schmidt of Cowen & Company.  Please proceed with your question.","","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","","Jim, you keeping pointing toward improved persistence for the strong Q4 results.  Can you provide with us any metrics or you're now able to talk about may be specifically the discontinuation rate or the average duration of therapy?","Jim Daly","Eric, we are reluctant to do that because unfortunately on a short period of time there's still got a not of lot of noise in the system, and unfortunately that noise is only going to increase as we go into January because your patients will be changing their specialty pharmacies because their insurance plans change.  As a result, we think there is a single best indicator right now to point to is looking at the dose mix.  I think when we have more time, when we have greater period of time and more stable data and the ability to separate signal from noise a little better, I think then will be more willing to talk about persistence rate in more specific terms.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","There is a couple of questions for Dave, if I could.  First on the ex-U.S. Jakafi sales, are you recording your royalties concurrently with the Novartis?  In other words, I think Novartis reported $21 million fourth quarter Jakafi sales so the $3.7 million in royalties is essentially 18% of that figure?","Dave Hastings","Yeah, that\u2019s correct, Eric.  We will do that concurrently now and in the future.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","And then for the 2013 COGS guidance you alluded to a 2% figure.  Is that inclusive of any actual cost of goods or are you still going through previously expensed product in 2013?","Dave Hastings","Yeah, our API is still the previously expensed product but we do have recurring cost of goods sold, things like our film finish of the product warehousing, shipping costs, so there is a component of our COGS that is manufacturing based.","Eric Schmidt - Cowen & Company","So most of the 2% sounds like the reverse royalty?","Dave Hastings","","We are not going to get that granular, Eric, in terms of what that break down is.","","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.  Please proceed with your question.","Do Kim - Piper Jaffray","Hi, this is actually Do Kim in for Ian.  I was hoping you could maybe talk about what you know about Novartis\u2019 initial success with Jakafi in Europe, and what Novartis is doing to keep the levels of drop out flow and how that compares to your experience in the U.S.?","And a couple of questions on the pipeline, how should we think about the three Phase III trials -- Phase II trial for the JAK1 inhibitor and about the future direction of that program in terms of oncology versus inflammatory?  And also whether if the pancreatic Phase II trial for Jakafi, could possibly be registration enabling?  Thank you.","Paul Friedman","Sure.  I will take the Novartis Jakafi.  Generally as a principle we rely on our partner describe their own performance but Rich and I happened to be up in New Jersey for the day yesterday and we are also aware what they said publicly.  So, as indicated previously, they sold $21 million in the fourth quarter.  They are approved in more than 30 countries.  They have launched in Canada, Germany, Austria, UK, Denmark and Norway.  They had over 2900 patients in the early access program.  So, they are very encouraged by their early performance at launch.","In terms of dose titration and length of therapy, in Europe, patients particularly with rare diseases tend to be referred more to tertiary care centers than in the U.S.  So, they are very confident that the ability of specialists who can treat a greater volume of MF patients to again be more fast forward with the dose and more diligent on the titration will allow them to minimize premature discontinuation.","Jim Daly","","Okay.  So, with respect to the JAK1 program that we have, we have a stable of interesting compounds that are selective for JAK1; 39110 is the first of those.  We are looking in myelofibrosis and in to inflammatory conditions at the efficacy and tolerability of 39110.  And I think we are planning to begin to see that data in the second half of this year.  And that data will guide us to where to go from there and which compounds beyond 39110 we might or we might not want to add to the clinical mix of these JAK1 selective compounds that we have.","I\u2019m going to ask Rich to comment on the third question that you asked, and that had to do with the registerability of the blinded Phase II overall survival pancreatic cancer study.","Rich Levy","Yeah.  So the study is a randomized study with about 60 to 65 per ARM.  So the results would have to be -- and but it is based on survival.  So I think you would have to have a very clear survival benefit for regulatory authorities to consider giving an approval or even accepting for filing based on this one study.  But if the results were very, very clear, I think it would be difficult for them not to consider making something like this available through labeling considering that there is very limited treatment options here.  It\u2019s a highly fatal -- rapidly fatal disease.  And if you can improve survival with quality of life there it has to be a possibility, but until we see the data it\u2019s really hard to say.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Salveen Richter with Canaccord Genuity.  Please proceed with your question.","Salveen Richter - Canaccord Genuity","Last quarter you have mentioned that 30% of target doctors had written a script.  Just wondering if you have an update there?  And then, also how you are going about restarting discontinued patients?","Paul Friedman","Yes, the figure we quoted was for the end of 2012.  so, we will give you an update on how we are doing in the first quarter of 2013 with our first quarterly results but that is the accurate; we penetrated about one third of our target audience of 6500 physicians.","And in terms of discontinuation, we are basically encouraging physicians that if they have identified a patient who they felt would derive benefit from Jakafi and that patient was discontinued particularly because of Cytopenias, and our research indicate that two thirds of discontinuations are due to Cytopenias, we are seeing the Thrombocytopenia as a cause for discontinuation decline, and so we are very focused on anemia.  We are encouraging those physicians to restart their patients on a lower dose and we are seeing some success with that.","Salveen Richter - Canaccord Genuity","Great, and then, Dave, just a question for you just wanted to get a sense of when you may record the $60 million in milestones and when you expect reimbursement in the specific EU countries?","Dave Hastings","Yeah, I think probably by mid year or so I mean.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo.  Please proceed with your question.","Brian Abrahams - Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on another good quarter.  I have a question for Jim.  I was wondering if you could talk about the role of patient advocacy groups particularly since the updated Jakafi survival data have been presented; just wondering if you anticipate that will have a growing any sort of growing impact on use patterns?  And then, as you think about the long term potential competitive dynamics how relevant is it having versus not having survival benefits on the label?  Does it really matter given the physician awareness of evolving data?  Thanks.","Paul Friedman","Okay.  Well we are spending a lot of time working with patient advocacy groups and we think it\u2019s a great investment primarily for patients.  And what we are seeing is that this has been a condition of watch and wait for physicians\/patients for a long time, and that an educated patient really in many cases is the catalyst for a as a treatment trigger for Jakafi.  So, certainly that is a very -- that is a very productive use of our time to work closely with the groups and overall survival clearly is a catalyst.  And what we are seeing is that when patients ask for Jakafi or about Jakafi in the vast majority of cases physicians will prescribe it.  So that is an important weaver and we remain very focused on it.","In terms of overall survival relative to future competitors, absolutely, I think if you look at the history of oncology products where you have an incumbent product with overall survival data I think history indicates it is very, very difficult for follow up competitors to displace that product.  And we are going to obviously be doing everything we can to keep that pattern intact when it comes to Jakafi.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of Thomas Wei of Jefferies & Co.  Please go ahead with your question.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co","I wanted to ask about the guidance.  It seems very low to me relative to the trend that you are seeing in the fourth quarter and if I incorporated all of this math quickly on the fly as you were talking about it on the call, I don\u2019t have a slight slowdown in new patient starts, I would actually need to drop my new patient start rate by somewhere between 20% and 35% immediately relative to the fourth quarter level.  So I wanted to try to understand to that is that the right way of thinking about it, and is that because you are actually starting to already see that type of slowdown so far during the first quarter of the year?","Paul Friedman","","Yeah, couple of things, Thomas.  Number one, we are not seeing a slowdown in new patient starts.  We are seeing a consistent rate of new patient starts in the fourth quarter, and as I said previously we are encouraged by what we have seen in January.  So I think that's point one.","Point two, we probably don't want to get into doing mass over the phone here for what I can assure you is that in order to hit the low end of our guidance, we are looking at unique growth dispensed bottles growing consistently quarter over quarter at a high single digit rate.  At the high end of guidance, we are looking at low double digit growth in units quarter over quarter, and then you have to layer on the impact of price, and as you remember we took a 9% price increase on November 16.  So that's really how you range, how we are ranging our unit growth.","If you take a look at a fairly linear phasing, let's take the 433 in the fourth quarter you'd have to adjust for a price benefit there.  Phase that growth over 2013 you are looking at between a 40% and a 50% fourth quarter '13 over fourth quarter '12 growth rate in terms of net revenues.  So we think that is ambitious.  We also think it is realistic and it's achievable.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co","And did I hear you correctly in answer to somebody else's question, did you say that the fourth quarter new patient starts were similar to third quarter new patient starts and that all of the increase in sales on a quarter basis is related to improvement in persistence and discontinuation rate?","Paul Friedman","What I said is overall, the rate of new patient adds has been consistent.  And if you take a look at the fourth quarter in particular, new patient's starts were consistent with our forecast that we used to generate the guidance of 130 to 135, and the favorability we had coming in at 136 was totally attributable to an increase in persistence.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co","And can you say that there's something unusual that the timing of new patients starts in the fourth quarter was very front-end loaded and not very much seen towards the end of the quarter?  I guess it doesn\u2019t, you're saying January actually looks pretty good.  So but did it follow that sort of pattern during the quarter or was it relatively consistent over the quarter?","Paul Freidman","I would say relatively consistent, Thomas.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co","Okay, I got some struggling a little bit, but because if you have 35 in third quarter and then in the end of July the rate is 42, in the fourth quarter your seeing kind of a consistent add over the quarter, then that 42 is not really becoming something much higher, and then you later on the price increase and we, I can follow-up with you offline on some of the math, but maybe just my last question here.","Paul Freidman","I think meeting the math that we've communicated really is the math that we're going to communicate, Thomas.  But again, we're giving a very tight guidance range of 210 to 225, and we're going to rely on you to complete your models, looking at how you get through to an increase in persistence and a modulation in new patient starts.","Thomas Wei - Jefferies & Co","Okay.  That's helpful.","Paul Freidman","I think we have a whole lot more math to add than that.","Operator","Our nest question is from the line of Ying Huang of Barclays.  Please proceed with your question.","Ying Huang - Barclays","First of all, this is a question for Jim.  So I noticed that the SG&A and going up to, yeah, $100 million to $110 million this year additional program.  Can you give us a little bit clarity on what additional programs you're planning for promotion for Jakafi this year?","And then secondly I noticed that they'll be a modified label in second quarter.  Can you give us a preview, what might be appearing on the FDA approved label in the second quarter?","And then lastly, obviously you have this on novel compound in Phase II.  Can you clarify what your relationship would Lilly is because obviously Lilly also has their JAK1 inhibitor Phase II trial as well?  Is there any conflict of interest or is there anything value wrote in the clause of the contract?  Thank you.","Jim Daly","On the promotional standards, there are two areas of focus, both professional education.  One is disease education, educating physicians on the nature of myelofibrosis, the disease course over time.  And number two is on the need for a dose titration.  So, it is our increase spend is largely focused on professional medical education.","Dave Hastings","","And then, Jim, I will also add that initially our foundation payments to assist Medicare patients are in there as well and as our sales increase that number goes higher, yeah.","Rich Levy","","So, with respect to Lilly, I think it is our understanding that the compound that they have in development is directed to myelofibrosis.  They had a JAK1 that they thought was selective for V617F JAK, right?","Jim Daly","Sir, I am not sure that I understood the question the same way that you did.  But on that topic I mean, that program had a lot of renal toxicity.","Rich Levy","Right.  And I think they are not developing in any --","Jim Daly","I do not know what they are doing.  We have a strict firewall between what they are doing in myelofibrosis.","Rich Levy","Right.  But that's our guess.  But with respect to the details of the contract we are not able to hallucinate those for you.  We just say that when we say that these compounds are Incyte priority compounds that is what we mean.","Ying Huang - Barclays","And then, on the label?","Jim Daly","Yes.  So, what this supplemental NDA is about is dosing for patient to start platelet counts less than a 100,000.  And as we have talked about in the past, we think the appropriate starting dose for those patients is 5 milligrams twice daily, that most of those patients can get up to 10 milligrams twice daily safely and when they do so they see efficacy similar to what we have seen in the COMFORT trial.  So, the proposed labeling is around that but until we actually get feedback from FDA I am not going to get specific about exactly what was proposed till we see what we end up with.","Ying Huang - Barclays","And Rich, the data presented at ASH, would that go in some label or is that something you proposed?","Rich Levy","","So the data that was presented at ASH is not in this submission that was made last August specifically on patients who start with platelet counts less than 100,000 the data is presented at ASH this year.  The data is presented on COMFORT study this year was largely on patient start with greater than 100,000.  There was one presentation given on the low platelet study and that is correct.  But in terms of the -- this data on the COMFORT studies that was presented at ASH showing both survival benefit first time in COMFORT-II whereas we have had one for a while in COMFORT-I and the data on dose titration in patients that start with greater than 100,000 platelet count.  That is likely to be the basis of a separate SNDA that we would file this year, but wouldn\u2019t have change of labeling on that within 2013.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of David Friedman of Morgan Stanley Please proceed with your question.","","David Friedman - Morgan Stanley","","Can you just comment on whether there is any inventory changes in advance of the November price increase, and then also if you can just discuss any details about how you\u2019re thinking about price this year and next year?","Paul Friedman","David, this was a very modest build and probably we had some wholesalers anticipate the anniversary of our launch, and that was corrected certainly within the next few weeks.  So as I said, we ended with -- when we\u2019re talking about 4% change off of essentially three weeks of inventory that\u2019s really a de minimis impact on the business.  And in terms of future price increases, no, we will not be commenting on those.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Joshua Schimmer of Lazard Capital Markets.  Please proceed with your question.","Joshua Schimmer - Lazard Capital Markets","","Paul, I guess you separated the Heme\/Onc indications from the inflam indications for Jakafi versus baricitinib.  Do you plan a similar two-drug strategy with the JAK1 inhibitors?  Also, at what stage would you plan on partnering inflam indications?  And then last, do you believe that PV on a global basis could be priced on part of the MF indication and if not is there an opportunity to differential price PV versus MF in some geographies based just on separate molecules?  Thanks.","Paul Friedman","","Josh, on the strategy for JAK1, obviously we talk about all the possibilities that you have just raised, and we need to see the results from these early Phase II trials as we try to optimize our strategy going forward.  I mean, each of the compounds that are coming along a little bit behind 39110; they all have slightly different characteristics.  And in an ideal world for clean labels, yeah, you would probably like to have compound inflam that was for inflame and a compound or maybe more than one for oncology, its way too early to speculate on if and when we would partner the inflam indications, but we will keep you updated as we go along.","On the pricing for PV I am going to ask Jim to comment on that.","Jim Daly","Yes, I think it's premature to be talking about PV pricing at this point; we are just getting into our pre-launch planning.  So, preliminarily we are excited by the opportunity.  We think we have a very strong value proposition.  The interesting thing here is the side effect in MF becomes the treatment benefit in PV in terms of reducing counts.  We're excited by the epidemiology.  There are a lot of patients who will benefit from Jakafi in PV.  And also I think the underappreciated dividend here is the length of the treatment.  These patients will be on treatment for an extended period of time.  So, we see a very exciting opportunity for the brand in PV.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of (inaudible).  Please proceed with your question.","Unidentified Analyst","It turns out that my mom plays mahjong with the Maryland Director of the Paul Freedman fan club because he grew up in Maryland, and she asked me a couple of questions last night and I gave her some answers and I want to run it by you guys.  In terms of patient metrics, she was saying well they are adding about, what's gross in that add?  And I said, well, I think gross are adding maybe 200 to 220 patients a month and net maybe 90 to 100 patients a month.  And then she asked me, well, are they, you know, I hear you told me that the lowering the dose, and she said do they have any ability to split the pill or the capsule?  And the other question that she sort of added and then I said I thought the price is the same regardless of the dose.  So could you confirm all that or tell me what I should tell my mom.","Paul Friedman","Well, let me I don\u2019t think we want to comment on new patients adds in general but I tell you what I will say.  I'll say your mom is not a bad is not a bad forecaster in terms of the new patient adds.  On the net, I don\u2019t want to make any comment at all on that.","In terms of splitting the tablet, we really don\u2019t see that as a feasible option.  We don\u2019t think that\u2019s an interest to patients to get into tablet splitting.  ","Unidentified Analyst","And then is the price the same across all those dosages?","Paul Friedman","It\u2019s flat pricing.","Jim Daly","Absolutely.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.  And then the final thing she thought I was discussing is tell me about JAK1 versus mix JAK1 JAK2.  What are they going to see from selective JAK1s if they don\u2019t get from JAK1 JAK2?  And the only thing I could tell her is I thought that JAK1 inhibitors sort of knocked down the cytokines in the inflammation but I wasn\u2019t very elegant in that standpoint, so I thought maybe Paul or Dr. Levy could help there.","Rich Levy","Yeah.  So, it's Rich.  So, I mean, things are theoretical until we see clinical data, but the idea is that erythropoietin and thrombopoietin signal through JAK2 exclusively, and that if you have a JAK inhibitor it doesn\u2019t signal through JAK2 you might see less anemia and thrombocytopenia while maintaining the benefits in terms of the inflammatory that exist.  Now, that difference could have impact in a disease like myelofibrosis where potentially you could see less anemia and thrombocytopenia.  But in diseases like rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis which are the other two that we are studying now, we believe now that there are JAK1 JAK2 inhibitors such as baricitinib that have a great efficacy without any significant anemia or thrombocytopenia.  So, it is an interesting feel to continue to look at.","The other aspect is in oncology where you have drugs that are being used that already are reducing blood counts that a JAK1 inhibitor may be more easily combinable with some of those drugs because it wouldn\u2019t contribute to the cytopenia.","Operator","Thank you.

A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. (Operator instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. ","It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Pamela Murphy, Vice President, Investor Relations and Communications. Thank you, Ms. Murphy. You may begin. ","Pamela Murphy","Good morning and welcome. With me today are Paul Friedman, Incyte\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Pat Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Dave Hastings, Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Levy, Executive Vice President, Chief Drug Development and Medical Officer. ","Paul will begin with a brief overview of the quarter, Pat will update you on the product launch of Jakafi, and Dave will describe our first quarter 2012 financial results. Prior to opening up the call for Q&A, Paul will close with a summary of some of our other programs.","Before beginning, we\u2019d like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations for the launch and commercialization of Jakafi as well as our development plans in other indications. ","These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2011, and from time to time in our SEC documents. Paul? ","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","Good morning, everyone. The launch of Jakafi for patients with intermediate- or high-risk myelofibrosis is going well.  During the first quarter we recognized $19.3 million in net sales of Jakafi and we shipped 25.1 to our specialty pharmacies. Jakafi is an important advance for patients who suffer from this progressive and life threatening disease. ","Given the compelling benefits it provides in terms of spleen reduction and symptom improvement, the encouraging survival data recently published in the New England Journal and the fact that this is the first FDA approved treatment for patients with MF, it\u2019s not surprising to me that interest in Jakafi is high. ","Additionally, last week our partner Novartis received recommendation by the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use, the CHMP, for approval of ruxolitinib, the treatment of disease related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients with primary post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia myelofibrosis. We look forward to seeing patients and physicians outside the US have access to the drug.","The positive CHMP opinion means that Incyte has earned a $40 million payment from Novartis and will earn a second payment of $60 million once Novartis receives reimbursement and pricing approval in specific EU countries. In the EU, the European Commission generally follows the recommendations of the CHMP and the decision will be applicable to all 27 EU member states. ","In addition to the ongoing extensions of our Phase II and Phase III trials in MF, Incyte and Novartis are conducting a global pivotal Phase III trial called RESPONSE in patients with advance polycythemia vera and we continue to expect the RESPONSE study to be completed in 2013 with our goal being to obtain FDA approval of the SNDA in 2014.","There are also a number of ongoing investigator-sponsored trials in leukemias and in lymphoma, and then there is the Incyte-sponsored trial in pancreatic cancer with that expected from that trial in 2013. ","So for now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pat and then to Dave. ","Patricia Andrews","As Paul said, the launch is going well. Our launch tracking surveys, as well as feedback from our field force, suggest that physicians who have tried Jakafi are impressed by how quickly the product works and how dramatically it improves the debilitating symptoms and splenomegaly that affects so many patients with MF.","In the near- to mid-term, we remain confident that this positive initial experience will lead to a steady increase in the use of Jakafi in patients with severe or moderate symptoms and\/or splenomegaly. ","Longer term, as we build awareness of the benefits of Jakafi and the burdensome progressive and life-threatening nature of MF, we expect that use of the product will gradually expand to include intermediate or high-risk MF patients with any degree of symptoms and\/or splenomegaly. ","While it\u2019s still early on in the product launch, I\u2019d like to describe a couple of factors that we think drove our first quarter sales and why we continue to believe that our launch will build gradually. First, since we\u2019ve launched Jakafi in November, we\u2019ve conducted a series of market research surveys with hematologist-oncologists that are remarkably consistent with positive feedback from the field, as well as our own prelaunch market research.  ","Approximately two weeks after we launched Jakafi, awareness of the product jumped from 20% to 80%, and in our most recent survey conducted at the end of March, awareness of Jakafi had increased to 87%. We\u2019re further encouraged by the fact that well over 80% of physicians who have yet to prescribe Jakafi, from the survey, say that they expect to use the product in the future. ","Our market research suggests that most patients receiving Jakafi thus far tend to have severe symptoms and larger spleens. This is consistent with our original expectations. In other words, the first patients on Jakafi tended to be the more ill patients in whom there was a clear belief that the benefit had the potential to outweigh the risks. It will take longer to move beyond these types of patients to those with earlier stage disease, and this will likely begin to occur as physicians become more comfortable with the product.","As of March 30th, approximately 1,000 physicians had prescribed Jakafi. Our marketing and sales efforts are focused on reaching about 6,500 hematologist-oncologists. Thus far, most physicians have written a prescription for Jakafi for one patient, however, there is a growing number who have written a prescription for two or three patients and a handful of physicians, including some key opinion leaders, many of whom participate in the Phase III trial, who have written a prescription for Jakafi for five or more patients.","About 85% of our prescribers are from the community and they have generated 70% to 75% of the volume since launch. This is consistent with our market research that says most MF patients are treated in the community setting. ","We believe most community physicians are less familiar with myelofibrosis as, on average, they have just a few such patients. Many of these physicians typically want more information, more education and more time prior to prescribing a new product like Jakafi. Therefore, we will continue to focus on systematically reaching more of the community-based physicians. ","Over time, we believe that most community hematologist-oncologists are likely to recognize the significance of our Phase III trial results, which clearly demonstrated the value of treatment with Jakafi as compared to placebo or best available therapy. ","We also believe many of these physicians will appreciate the encouraging data on overall survival recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at ASH. But this will take time, which is why we believe that going forward, our growth rates for new prescribers and new patients may be more gradual than what we saw in the first quarter. ","Regarding our experience with payers, because payers take 90 to 180 days to make formulary decisions, most scripts in the first quarter were still being processed as exceptions. The exception process is not necessarily indicative of the level of restrictions or patient out of pocket costs once the formulary decision is made. With that caveat, more than 40% of the time in the first quarter, Jakafi scripts were processed without restrictions. ","The scripts that had prior authorizations were most likely ones that required a diagnosis of myelofibrosis or were limited in quantity, such as a maximum 30-day supply at any one time, and nearly all of these prior authorizations were approved. We should have a better sense of formulary coverage and restrictions later this year. ","As expected, the price has not been a significant issue with most payers. About 55% of patients have been commercial pay. This is higher than the 40% to 45% that we originally estimated, though the percentage has been trending slightly downward and may continue to do so. About 80% of commercial patients have had copays of less than $100 a month. ","About 30% of patients have been covered by Medicare Part D. This is lower than the 40% we expected, but as this has begun to trend slightly upward, the percentage may continue to increase over time. Nearly all Medicare Part D patients have been covered under the standard benefit design and many have sought and been able to access funds through charitable foundations. ","10% to 15% of patients have received free drug. This is consistent with our original estimates. The remaining patients have Medicaid or receive care through other government programs such as the VA, 340Bs and TRICARE.","To summarize, the first full quarter of the launch has gone well. Most of our assumptions regarding initial patients use, physician mix, payer acceptance and patient access are close to what we anticipated. We\u2019re off to a good start, and over the next few years we\u2019re confident that the use of Jakafi has the potential to fundamentally change the way myelofibrosis is treated by providing significant benefits to patients with any degree of symptoms and\/or splenomegaly. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave. ","David Hastings","Thanks, Pat and good morning, everybody. I\u2019m going to start my overview this morning by discussing our cash position. We ended the quarter with $236 million in cash and investments, excluding $19 million in restricted cash held in escrow for interest payments through October, 2012 on our 4.75% convertible senior notes. ","Our ending Q1 cash also excludes the $40 million milestone earned from Novartis announced last week based on the recommendation by CHMP for EU approval of ruxolitinib. This milestone will be recognized as revenue and paid in the second quarter of 2012. We expect to earn an additional $60 million when Novartis receives pricing and reimbursement approval from a subset of major European countries. We expect that to occur sometime in early 2013. ","Now moving to product revenue. It\u2019s important to note that we are still using the sell-through method for revenue recognition, which means we defer revenue until the specialty pharmacy ships the product to the patient. We will transition to the more customary policy of recognizing revenue when our product is received by the specialty pharmacies once we have an established track record for product returns. While we do not expect product returns to be material, this interim accounting treatment is standard practice for many new products. ","As Paul mentioned, for the quarter ended March 31st, we shipped 25.1 million of product to our specialty pharmacies and recorded gross revenue of $21.2 million. Our gross to net adjustment for product revenue recognized for the first quarter was approximately $1.9 million, resulting in net product revenue of $19.3 million. 31st [ph] was $6.5 million and our gross to net adjustment on our deferred revenue was $500,000, resulting in net deferred revenue of $6 million.","Our gross to net adjustment includes the following:  fees to our specialty pharmacies, rebates to governmental payers, our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients, copay assistance to eligible privately insured patients, and any product returns. ","It\u2019s too early in the launch to provide guidance on product revenue and we will do so once we have a longer track record and greater clarity of the underlying trends related to Jakafi sale. It is also too early in the launch to provide guidance regarding the gross to net adjustment on a go-forward basis. ","In terms of our non-product revenue, we are increasing guidance from $67 million to $107 million for 2012 to include the $40 million milestone earned from Novartis. Our cost of goods sold was immaterial as our starting finished goods inventory was previously expensed as R&D prior to FDA approval. And in terms of operating expenses, both R&D and SG&A were within our expectations. ","So with $236 million in cash, the $40 million milestone we just earned from Novartis, the potential for additional significant milestones, and a product launch that\u2019s going well, I\u2019m confident we\u2019re in a strong financial position. ","With that, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Paul.","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","Okay, thanks, Dave. So before going to Q&A, I\u2019m going to just briefly take you through the status for the rest of our pipeline. For Incyte 28050, the JAK1 and JAK 2 inhibitor partnered with Lilly, the six month Phase IIb trial in rheumatoid arthritis patients is complete and all eligible patients are now in the open label extension phase. ","The three-month data will be presented at ULAR in a late break or oral session, or the late break or oral session, and we expect the six-month data to be presented at ACR. Plans for the Phase III program are well underway and we would expect that Phase III program to start later this year. ","Lilly is also conducting a double-blind placebo controlled dose ranging study to explore the efficacy and safety of 050 in 240 adults with moderate to severe psoriasis, and while it\u2019s obviously dependent on the timing of patient enrollment, we\u2019re expecting to see data for the primary endpoint in the first half of next year. ","Our earlier stage oncology programs for C-MET and IDO are ongoing. For the C-MET inhibitor, we\u2019re nearing completion of the initial Phase I trial in patients with solid tumors, and in parallel to that, Novartis has now initiated a study in patients with C-MET dependent advanced solid tumors. For IDO, we plan on beginning our Phase II trial in patients with melanoma mid-year, followed by a trial in patients with ovarian cancer in the second half of the year. ","We have other ongoing proprietary clinical development programs in oncology and inflammation. I\u2019ve mentioned them before, but I haven\u2019t described them for competitive reasons. At the appropriate time, I look forward and plan to describe these programs to you. ","Operator, could we now please open the call for Q&A? ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now be conducting the question and answer session. (Operator instructions) Our first question is coming from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch. Please state your question. ","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Good morning and congratulations. Fantastic start to the Jakafi launch. A couple of questions. ","One is just, Pat, you made a comment that the growth rate in subsequent quarters should be slower, so I just wanted to dig in to that because on the one hand, you\u2019re telling us that the large volume of prescriptions is coming from the community. You still have a huge runway of prescribers to be adding and physicians are starting to go from one to two to three to four prescriptions, so I just want to understand how to interpret that comment. ","And then separately, Paul, I wanted to ask you about the Lilly partnered RA program and try to understand how important the tofacitinib panel is to your Phase III planning. Thanks very much.","","Patricia Andrews","Hi, Rachel. Good morning. So, what I meant by saying that growth in the future will be gradual relates to the patient population that we\u2019ve been able to reach, so I do think there\u2019s a large opportunity in total out there, but it\u2019s the first patients we\u2019ve reached have been those with more severely ill patients with symptoms, more burdensome symptoms, larger splenomegaly, and those probably would come faster because it\u2019s more obvious that they should get the drug and they should get the drug right away. ","But over time, we will, of course, be moving into the patient population, which ultimately is larger, which is patients who don\u2019t have as advanced disease. They may have any degree of symptoms and splenomegaly and it will take longer to make inroads into that patient population, so I do expect continued growth, but I don\u2019t necessarily expect the growth in absolute numbers to be as large for new prescribers or new patients as it was in the first quarter. ","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","Rachel, can you just repeat the Lilly question, please?","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Yes, I\u2019m just curious -- there\u2019s an upcoming tofacitinib panel on May 9th where, obviously, that product\u2019s going to be reviewed and I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s any information or how we should think about that panel impacting your Phase III planning, if at all. ","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","So, obviously, that panel is quite important and we\u2019re definitely going to be tuned in, and Lilly will be, too, as to what transpires there. There are common features between tofacitinib and 28050, but there are also some distinguishing features that we believe, in general, favor 28050, but if there are class issues that come up that are either good or bad, depending on how the committee discusses them and ultimately votes on them, I\u2019m certain that Lilly, with our input, will use that information to adjust what is now a very mature Phase III plan. ","But we are cautiously optimistic that that advisory committee should go reasonably well. The data looked pretty good. We just never know what twists and turns could come out of it that could be useful to you in finalizing your Phase III development plan. ","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America\/Merrill Lynch","Okay, thanks very much. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Co. Please state your question. ","Eric Schmidt, PhD \u2013 Cowen & Co. ","Congratulations, as well, on a great start. Maybe for Pat, just wondering if you have any kind of rough guesstimate of the proportion of the severe and moderate patient population that you have penetrated or any kind of estimate of how many more quarters it might take to get to a more mature point in time with that phase of the launch.","And then a question for perhaps Dave, you\u2019ve mentioned in the past the channel inventory, I think at the end of Q4, was about two or three weeks\u2019 worth of sales. Is that still the case at the end of Q1?","Patricia Andrews","Good morning, Eric. I don\u2019t have an estimate for you on how deeply into the patient population we\u2019ve penetrated, but I can tell you in our launch tracking surveys, approximately, which we interviewed about 50 hematologist-oncologists. ","We\u2019ve been doing it every two weeks or every month since we got approval, that for those -- and they all had to have treated at least one patient with Jakafi, and that suggests that about 80% of their use was in patients with moderate or severe symptoms and are splenomegaly, and about 90% were intermediate, too, or high-risk, so you can see that the usage is definitely, at the moment, in that more severe patient population, and we still have a significant inroads to make there, as well, as over the longer term in a patient population less burdened by the disease but still with splenomegaly and\/or symptoms. ","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","And, Eric, yes, we\u2019re estimating the specialty pharmacies hold about two to three weeks of inventory than the Q1. ","Eric Schmidt, PhD \u2013 Cowen & Co. ","Okay, and if I can squeak in one more, in the past, I think you\u2019ve guided to essentially no cost of goods in 2012 given the better ramp here that we\u2019re seeing. Is that still the case? ","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","Yes. ","Eric Schmidt, PhD \u2013 Cowen & Co. ","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies & Co.  Please state your question. ","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thanks. Just a follow up, again, on this whole point about the commentary about future growth. I guess I\u2019m just trying to make sure that I completely understand that the slower growth rate that you\u2019re talking about going forward, it does not sound like that\u2019s a trend that you have already seen, say toward the end of the first quarter or the early second quarter. That\u2019s just something that you\u2019re guessing is going to happen in some future quarter. Is that the right way to interpret that? ","Patricia Andrews","That\u2019s the right way to interpret it. I\u2019m just -- I\u2019m looking at the patient population that\u2019s out there and our plan for how we reach them, and how physician prescribing behavior is much more likely to go to a more severely ill patient first and then they need to have experience with that. ","This all takes a substantial amount of time to unroll, so that\u2019s just how I\u2019m looking going forward. ","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co","Is it fair to say that, actually, if you look at the trajectory over the course of the quarter, maybe it\u2019s actually the opposite of what the last question was that I was indicating, that towards the end of the first quarter even, whatever trends you\u2019re seeing in the early second quarter, that things may actually be accelerating? ","Patricia Andrews","Thomas, we\u2019re not going be able to give more insight into what the quarter looks like. It\u2019s too early at this stage of the launch. So what I can say is that the scripts and patient numbers were strong, as you gathered, and we attribute a lot of that to the use that came from key opinion leaders and from early adopters in the community, and all of them treating more severely ill patients, so that\u2019s really just where we are right now.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co","And maybe a question on this whole stability inventory stocking question, are you able to say whether or not you\u2019re more towards the lower end of that range or the higher end of that range? ","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","Thomas, I think we\u2019re right there. I mean, it\u2019s a pretty small range, two to three weeks, and that\u2019s looking like that\u2019s going to be the range, and that\u2019s what we expected going into the launch and nothing\u2019s changed. ","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co","So if you\u2019re kind of right in the middle of that range, then the two to three weeks and the $6.5 million would actually suggest that the exiting run rate at the end of the quarter would be in the kind of low- to mid-30\u2019s? Is that the right sort of math? Am I doing that correctly?","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","Again, we don\u2019t -- we\u2019re not going to comment directly on that, Thomas. As Pat has said, the launch is going well and --","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co","Okay, and then maybe just one last thing. The high risk populations, you had originally said that it was 30%, I think, of all myelofibrosis patients, and if you\u2019re still confident in the overall number of patients there, the first quarter doesn\u2019t really represent very much penetration of that group of just the high risk patients. Is that fair?","Patricia Andrews","What we\u2019ve always said, Thomas, is that physicians in practice look at their MF patients as mild, moderate and severe, and within that, each one is about a third of the population. If you\u2019re actually looking at risk prognostic factors, there\u2019s four gradations and it\u2019s low, intermediate one, intermediate two, high risk, and of course, we\u2019re indicated for intermediate and high risk. ","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co","Thanks. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Matt Roden with UBS. Please state your question. ","Matt Roden, PhD \u2013 UBS","Great, thanks. First of all, congrats on the great execution of the launch here and thanks for taking my question. It looks like there\u2019s obviously a lot of demand here in myelofibrosis, but is there any evidence of physician-driven spontaneous adoption in the other indications such as PV?","Patricia Andrews","As might be expected with a new product in the new -- that\u2019s from a new class for patients mostly treated in the community, there\u2019s not been much usage outside of myelofibrosis, and that would be expected and I think that that would continue for quite a while because just like they need to get comfortable with the patient population that they\u2019re treating in myelofibrosis, it would take much, much, much longer for them to have comfort outside of that for a large number of physicians. Of course, there would always be some exceptions. ","Matt Roden, PhD \u2013 UBS","Okay, great, thanks. And then just lastly, Pat, a question on coverage. You mentioned that most patients that you\u2019re seeing have gained access to the drug, but of those who have not so far gained access, was there any common features in those patients that we should take into consideration as we think about maybe low -- are there any subsets that we should expect low expectations for?","Patricia Andrews","No, really, coverage has been very broad, very open and it\u2019s not always been immediate because there have been prior auth and sometimes additional information needs to be provided, but it\u2019s nearly always been ultimately successful and there wouldn\u2019t be a characteristic that I could point out which has been -- ","I mean, the only time it\u2019s not been successful, really, is when it\u2019s not been for myelofibrosis because the prior authorizations usually do require that and that\u2019s one that they\u2019re not usually going to go around. ","Matt Roden, PhD \u2013 UBS","Great. Thanks very much and congratulations. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Liisa Bayko with JMP Securities. Please state your question. ","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Hi, and I\u2019d also like to get in the queue and say congratulations on the great quarter. I just wanted to maybe get a sense of your plans for ASCO, what kind of data you\u2019ll be discussing there and also ULAR, your presence there with the RA data. ","Richard Levy","This is Rich. There\u2019s a little bit of data at ASCO that is brand new. A lot of it is looking back again at the COMFORT studies and providing more detailed analyses in certain areas. ","The one study that we\u2019re going to be presenting that we\u2019ve not talked about before is one in patients who start with counts below 100,000, or essentially between 50,000 and 100,000, and we\u2019ll be presenting data where those patients start at five milligrams twice daily and worked their way up. ","And just a general sense of that, most patients are able to work their way up to doses that are effectively treating both cytokine and spleen-related symptoms and we\u2019ll provide more data on that, and I believe that the actual titles of the ASCO presentations were posted maybe this morning or last night. ","In terms of the ULAR, the only presentation is the Lilly presentation on their Phase IIb study with R28050. That\u2019s three-month data. We expect the six-month data to be presented at ACR, and I think you\u2019ve heard from Lilly, who tends to be very quiet, that they\u2019re talking now in their call, I guess yesterday or the day before, they\u2019re talking about the drug and their expectations to go into Phase III, so you can take from that that the date looked good. ","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","I would just reiterate that last point. I think the data looked very good and people will be highly impressed with how clean the compound is, how low the dose is and how eye-popping the efficacy data is. ","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay, wow. Looking forward to that. Will you be hosting any sort of analyst\/investor event there? ","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","No. ","Patricia Andrews","Not at ULAR, probably at ACR. ","Liisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities","Okay, great, and then just a final question on the European label. I noted they sort of indicated that it was for usage in people who are displaying signs or symptoms along with splenomegaly. Can you give us a sense of how restrictive you think that will be and in what percentage of the patients with myelofibrosis actually have either signs, symptoms or splenomegaly? Thank you.","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","I think it\u2019s actually, at the end of the day, at least as broad as what we have. It\u2019s anyone. It could be -- they could be viewed as low risk, but if they had spleen or symptoms, they would be eligible under that label to be treated. There\u2019s no restriction with respect to platelets there, either, so I would say it\u2019s -- the indication is pretty broad. ","Richard Levy","Yes, remember that -- I don\u2019t know if we talked about this before, but low-risk patients, for example, 50% of them have significant splenomegaly, and a lot of them have symptoms as well. They don\u2019t have the so-called constitutional symptoms, the fever, night sweats and weight loss, but they can have many of the other symptoms, pruritus as well as the spleen-related symptoms, so I think it is a broad label for them. ","Liisa A. Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities, LLC","Excellent, and congratulations on all the accomplishments this quarter. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Salveen Richter with Canaccord Genuity. Please state your question.  ","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Thanks for taking my questions and congrats on a good quarter. I\u2019m just wondering, Pat, if you have any expectations for the period of time that they key targeted physicians who have not yet prescribed the drug could come online?","And then I think you\u2019ve previously mentioned that about 15% to 20% of MF patients are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Are you seeing any of these patients get treatment? ","Patricia Andrews","Good morning, Salveen. I think physicians who haven\u2019t prescribed, in the surveys, they said within the next six months or when they have a next MF patient come in, so that\u2019s why I do believe that will be gradual but steady over many quarters to come just because of how the patients come in and how the physicians get comfortable with the treating -- treatment aspects of it. ","And the second question was? ","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Just about the 15% to 20% or more of patients that are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. ","Patricia Andrews","Right, so I wouldn\u2019t have any information on that. What comes in to us is they were diagnosed with MF, and therefore, they\u2019re going on our drug. If they had previously been MDS or something else, I wouldn\u2019t know that. ","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","And then if I could just ask another, where do you stand in regards to deciding on the registration study and ET with Jakafi?","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","Rich, do you want to comment on that? ","Richard Levy","Yes. We have our thoughts kind of together on this and the next step is putting together a package to talk to FDA and see whether or not our preliminary approach is one that they are going to like, and if that\u2019s the case, we\u2019d probably start sometime in early 2013. ","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Great, thank you. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan Chase. Please state your question. ","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Hi. Good morning, guys, and thank you for taking the question. I have two of them for you that I have left. First, I realize the launch is more or less matching your internal expectations based on your market research at this point, but is there anything in the early commercial trends or the physician feedback that you have been surprised by? ","And then secondly, I\u2019m just wondering if there\u2019s anything you can say about early patient dropouts or maybe the general tolerability of the drug as you\u2019re getting kind of in the real world? ","Patricia Andrews","Sure. Good morning, Cory. No, there\u2019s really been no -- nothing that we hadn\u2019t anticipated because we had done, really, an extensive amount of market research, so I think that it\u2019s very much meeting our expectations in how we thought things would happen. ","Possibly initial uptake was a little bit faster than we thought, but that aside -- and then as far as early tolerability of the drug, which we know is very tolerable, but how is it in the real world, it would be too early for us to have significant insight into that. ","The drug\u2019s not been on the market that long and most patients would have done one or two months of therapy at most, but we have a high level of confidence based on the results from the clinical trial that this is a well-tolerated drug. ","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","So there\u2019s been nothing anecdotal about patients dropping off the drug earlier than you would have expected? ","Patricia Andrews","No, there hasn\u2019t been.","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JP Morgan Chase","Okay. Alright, thanks and great job with your early launch. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Ying Wang with Barclays Capital. Please state your question. ","Ying Wang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Thank you for taking my question, as well. It was very a [inaudible] quarter. My first question is your gross to net adjustment is about 9% this quarter and should we assume roughly the same range going forward? ","And then second question is what\u2019s the rationale behind using capecitabine as a pancreatic cancer trial [inaudible] because I know that drug was not approved as a treatment for pancreatic here? ","David Hastings","I\u2019ll take the growth net question, Ying. It\u2019s a little too early in the launch to really guide as to what the ultimate steady state gross to net percentage will be. We need to see further trends in things like the breakdown of the type of patients and the like, so it will take at least a couple more quarters to really have a stable trend there, I think. ","Richard Levy","With respect to your second question, we\u2019re studying second line pancreatic cancer and there are not specific drugs that are approved for that, and it has been historically the case that you can study your drug in combination with unapproved drugs in such settings as long as you get that buy-in from the Food and Drug Administration or other regulators around the world. ","This is a Phase II study. It has a small percentage of being a registration study if the results are very strong. We anticipate that more likely we would start a registration study based on these results and have detailed discussions with FDA once we have results of this in hand. ","Ying Wang \u2013 Barclays Capital","But I assume you saw some sort of pre-clinical activity between the two drugs, between ruxolitinib and capecitabine?","Paul Friedman, M.D.","Yes, we have seen the graph-type models where we see activity, but one of the other rationales for using capecitabine is the lack of overlapping toxicity, especially with respect to bone marrow suppression, whereas the first line drug does have bone marrow suppressive activities and we just thought that was a wiser way to go and the xenograft model supported that.   "," ","Ying Wang \u2013 Barclays Capital","Got it. Congratulations again. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of David Friedman with Morgan Stanley. Please state your question. ","David Friedman, MD \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi. This is Breanne calling in for Dave. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering if you could provide any color on what you\u2019re seeing in terms of Jakafi dose reductions.","Patricia Andrews","It\u2019s really too early in the launch to have much insight into dose reductions. There\u2019s been titration. It\u2019s a product that does get titrated in the judgment of the physician. They might have started low and titrate up to go for more efficacy. They might have started maybe higher than they should have for the patient and they dose down, so it\u2019s a drug that does have titration and it would be too early for us to be able to read into what those titrations mean at this point. ","David Friedman, MD \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Brian Abrahams with Wells Fargo Securities. Please state your question. ","Brian Abrahams, MD \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Hi. This is Shin Kang calling in for Brian. Congratulations on a great quarter. Thinking about launch trajectory in Europe, I was wondering if the Early Access program in Europe gives a head start in pricing negotiation and maybe accelerate the uptake in Europe, and any additional information on country by country launch timeline would be very helpful. Thanks. ","Patricia Andrews","I\u2019m sorry, but we\u2019re not able to give greater color for Novartis here. It\u2019s their market and I wouldn\u2019t want us to be speaking on their behalf. ","Brian Abrahams, MD \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities","Okay, fair enough, thanks. ","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Sapna Srivastava with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question. ","Sapna Srivastava \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hello. Hello?","Paul Friedman, M.D.","Good morning, Sapna. ","Sapna Srivastava \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi. Congratulations on a great quarter and a great launch. Most of the questions have been asked. I just had a quick follow up. I was trying to really just understand in between the high-risk patients and intermediate to low-risk, what is the differential in awareness between physicians and diagnosis rates currently form your understanding, for our understanding, to see how the drug can pick up in the low-risk patients as we move forward in the launch?","Patricia Andrews","Sapna, I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a difference on diagnosis. I think it\u2019s a difference in the physician\u2019s perception of how that patient presents and are they presenting -- let me re-step. I\u2019m going back to, of course, physicians in the community tend to look at it as the patient being mild, moderate and severe rather than on prognostic levels. ","So with that, I think their characterization is usually based on the extent that the patient has splenomegaly and the extent that the patient has symptoms. Sometimes they may factor in whether the patient is transfusion-dependent or not and what their platelet count is, but in general, they work on splenomegaly and symptoms and that the diagnosis is for MF, but then they just characterize them on one of those three ways. ","So I think your question on penetration into that group, into those intermediate patients who may be more -- or high risk may be more mild in their symptoms. That would be the longer term challenge that we face is to make inroads into that patient population and I feel confident that we will do so. It just -- it will be gradual because it takes a while for a physician who doesn\u2019t have a lot of patients who have MF to get comfortable with the treatment paradigms, the right patient population, how you manage that patient and the benefits that patient gets.","So those are all things that just come with time, so that\u2019s how we see -- and they come with education in the marketplace and being -- and having a speaker from the platform at educational events, talk about the product and the treatment. They come over time through education, experience and growing comfort levels. ","Sapna Srivastava \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thank you so much.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Elliott Savis [ph] with Savis Research [ph]. Please state your question. ","Elliott Savis \u2013 Savis Research","Hi. Thanks for taking my call. Just wondering if you could talk about your estimates for duration of therapy for patients on Jakafi. Thanks. ","Patricia Andrews","MF is a chronic disease and Jakafi is a chronic medicine, so we would expect, just as we saw in the clinical trials, that many patients who go on drug do, in fact, stay on it for many years. However, there will always be some patients who stay on it less and some who stay on it very long periods of time. ","So that\u2019s our anticipation going forward. It\u2019s too early in the launch cycle to make any -- draw any conclusions from real world experience. Many patients will have only been on drug for a month or two months. ","Elliott Savis \u2013 Savis Research","Is there anything in clinical trial data that helps you estimate duration of use?","Richard Levy","In the Phase II study, which is the longest use which started in 2007, data was presented at ASH this past year by Dr. Verstovsek showing that at that point, the median duration of treatment was about three years. But again, as Pat says, clinical trials and real world can be somewhat different and we just can\u2019t assess whether the real world is going to be matching that number yet. That\u2019s something we\u2019ll look at over the next couple years. ","Elliott Savis \u2013 Savis Research","Okay, thanks. ","Operator","There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the floor back over to Dr. Paul Friedman for closing remarks. ","Paul Friedman, M.D. ","Okay, thank you and thank you all for your attention and questions today.

In 2014, sales of Jakafi grew over 50% in the U.S. and Novartis sales of Jakafi has grown over 70% in ex-U.S. territories when compared to 2013.","We also recorded revenue of over $100 million from milestone in 2014 and ended the year with $600 million in cash. So this leaves us in a very strong financial position as we move into 2015. We have also been very successful in attracting top talents to Incyte over the last 12 months adding more than 100 positions across the company and the vast majority of this in our R&D organization managing our growing portfolio.","And speaking of our R&D portfolio, firstly, our goal is to maintain and expand our leading position in JAK inhibition, and the recent FDA approval of Jakafi in PV is further evidence of that as is the initiation of pivotal studies of ruxolitinib in solid tumors.","Our next generation JAK1 selective inhibitors will give us further potential to extend our competitive advantage here.","The second piece is our IDO1 inhibitor which provides us with potentially exciting entrance into immuno-oncology and we are moving forward up quickly to recruit our combination studies with PD1, PDR1 inhibitors. Our global alliance with Agenus also gives us additional strategic flexibility within the immuno-oncology area.","The third piece is our targeted therapies portfolio, and we have made real progress in the development of our two PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors and we have recently disclosed two new compounds an FGFR Inhibitor and the BRD Inhibitor that I expect it to enter the clinic sooner.","The first segment of our portfolio contains our two partners' compounds capmatinib with Novartis, which continues to move forward quickly the c-MET inhibitor and baricitinib with Lilly which has recently reported positive top-line result in the first of its Phase III trials in RA.","So I will now pass to Jim to give some additional detail on the commercial performance in MF and the launch of Jakafi in PV. Jim?","Jim Daly","Thank you, Herv\u00e9, and good morning, everyone. Our fourth quarter net product sales of $106 million of Jakafi reflect continued strong growth in underlying demand in myelofibrosis growing 46% over the same period last year. In terms of quarter-over-growth, net sales grew 8%. Overall, our fourth quarter performance was consistent with previous quarters with the steady increase in new patients, an increase in the breadth and depth of prescribing and a continued shift toward the use of lower dosage strengths.","For the full year of 2014, we recorded net Jakafi sales of $358 million growing more than 50% over 2013.","Turning to 2015, we expect full year net product sales to be in the range of $525 million to $565 million reflecting year-over-year growth between 47% and 58%. Our guidance assumes continued growth in MF sales as well as the contribution from our newly approved indication in PV.","On December 4, Jakafi was approved by the FDA for the treatment of patients with polycythemia vera who had an inadequate response to or intolerant of hydroxyurea. Jakafi is the first and only FDA proved treatment for these patients with uncontrolled PV.","We\u2019re still very early in the PV launch but we can\u2019t confirm that our initial impressions of launch progress are consistent with our prelaunch expectations. Firstly, there is a substantial unmet need for PV patients who are not well-managed on hydroxyurea. Physicians acknowledge having these uncontrolled PV patients in their practices and are open to considering new and better treatment options. We continue to estimate an addressable population of approximately 25000 patients in the U.S.","Secondly, as we shared with you in the past, the urgency to identify specific patients and initiate a new treatment is less than in MF or in other more acute forms of cancer. As we expected, it will require time and education to realize the peak potential of Jakafi in PV. Importantly, and again as expected, the clinical profile of Jakafi, as represented by the product labeling and the recent publication of the response trial in the New England journal of Medicine, is being well received by physicians. This is evidenced by the rapid uptake of the 10 milligram 28-day sample starter program for PV patients that we initiated after approval in December. We look forward to providing you additional feedback on the PV launch progress on future earnings calls.","So with that, I\u2019ll turn it over to Rich to give us an update on the clinical portfolio.","Rich Levy","Thanks, Jim. I\u2019ll begin with JAK inhibition, and starting with ruxolitinib in solid tumors the two pivotal Phase III studies JANUS 1 and JANUS 2 in combination with capecitabine in second-line pancreatic cancer continue to enroll patients and we expect top-line results from these trials during 2016.","Similarly, the randomized Phase II trials of ruxolitinib in non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and colorectal cancer are enrolling patients as planned with results expected in 2016.","And we believe that JAK1 selective inhibition, sparing JAK2, may lead to equivalent efficacy but with less myelosuppression relative to inhibiting both JAK1 and JAK2. Minimizing myelosuppression may potentially enable the combination of JAK1 selective inhibitors with other more myelosuppressive therapies.","The proof-of-concept Phase II trial of our lead JAK1 selective inhibitor 39110 in patients with EGFR wild type non-small cell lung cancer in combination with docetaxel is well underway as is the Phase II trial 39110 in combination with erlotinib in patients with EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer.","Later this year, we intend to initiate a fully powered randomized blinded controlled study of 110 in combination with gemzar and abraxane in first-line pancreatic cancer. We expect data from 39110 in combination with our PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor 40093 in patients with B-lymphoid malignancies to present at ASCO this year. This proof-of-concept combination trial was based on internal research, which revealed significant synergy between JAK1 selective and PI3K\u03b4 inhibition in models of lymphoma.","We have a second JAK1 selective inhibitor 52793. This molecule is currently in a Phase I dose-escalation study and there's severalfor more selective for JAK1 than 39110. We plan to initiate both mono and combination therapy trials with 52793 potentially in multiple myeloma. 52793 as the more JAK1 selective compound was selected to be studied in myeloma as improvements in anemia is a therapeutical in this disease.","Now moving to immuno-oncology. Recruitment into all four Phase I, II studies of epacadostat, our IO1 inhibitor, and the anti-PD-1 or PD-L1 therapy is from Merck, BMS, AstraZeneca and Genentech is progressing well.","Once we determine the dosage to be used in each combination we expect enrolment and the expansion towards to be quite rapid. If these trials generate positive proof-of-concept data, we would anticipate moving swiftly into potential registration studies.","In the Targeted Therapy segment of our portfolio, we have two PI3K\u03b4 inhibitors in clinical development and each of these compounds provide the potential to differentiate from the marketed PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor that'll allow us on potency, PK and safety.","50465 a highly selective PI3K\u03b4 inhibitor has now entered Phase I development and 40093 our first delta inhibitor is advancing in both immunotherapy, as I mentioned earlier, combination proof of concept trials.","The discovery team at Incyte continues to create molecules with best-in-class potential. We've recently disclosed two new candidates an EGFR inhibitor 54828 and a BRD inhibitor 54329, both of which are expected to enter the clinic very shortly. The Fgr family of receptor tyrosine kinases can act as oncogenic drivers in a number of tumor types, most notably squamous non-small cell lung cancer, gastric and bladder cancer, and glioblastoma.","Bromodomain-containing proteins or BRDs play important roles in mediating gene transcription, most notably by facilitating the expression of oncogenes such as MYC, one of the most frequently dysregulated oncogenes in all of human cancer.","And lastly, a quick update on our partnered programs with Novartis and Lilly. Novartis continues to make progress in the clinical development of capmatinib, our potent and selective c-MET inhibitor. And with respect to baricitinib, the rheumatoid arthritis Phase III program being run by Lilly is ongoing. The BEACON Phase III trial of Baricitinib in RA patients with inadequate response to TNF inhibitors met its primary end point and, during 2015, we look forward to seeing data from the additional Phase II studies.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Dave to give us the financial highlights of the quarter and further outline our financial guidance for 2015.","David Hastings","Thanks, Rich, and good morning, everybody. I'll start today by discussing Q4 results and then review our 2015 guidance. We recorded $106 million of fourth quarter net product revenues and $15 million in Jakafi royalties from Novartis for sales outside of the United States.","Our cost of product revenues of $2 million for the fourth quarter reflects the payment of royalties to Novartis on Jakafi sales. Both R&D and SG&A in the fourth quarter and the full year were within our expectations. For the full year 2014 R&D expense was $348 million and SG&A was $166 million. From a cash perspective, we ended the year with $600 million which includes a $60 million milestone payment that we received from Novartis in Q4.","Now moving in 2015 guidance. As Jim mentioned, our net product revenue from Jakafi is expected to be in the range of $525 million to $565 million reflecting continued growth in underlying demand in MF and including revenue from the launch of PV.","We do not intend to break out Jakafi sales by indication either historically or in guidance, but we do intend to provide a more comprehensive update on the PV launch after six months at our Q2 earnings call.","Looking now at contract revenue expectations for 2015, we expect to recognize $13 million in contract revenue from the continued amortization of the upfront payment we received under the Lilly collaboration agreement. We do not anticipate earning any milestones under the collaboration agreement with Lilly during 2015.","Under the Novartis collaboration agreement, we expect to earn up to $45 million in milestone revenue during 2015. Included in this figure is $25 million we earned with the positive opinion issued by CHMP on Jakafi and PV in late January.","Novartis continues the successful global rollout of Jakafi ex-U.S. and reported over 70% sales growth in 2014 versus the previous year. We look forward to the anticipated continued growth of our royalty receipts from Jakafi.","We expect that the cost of product revenue as a percent of net Jakafi sales in 2015 will be between 4% and 5% which includes our tiered low single digit royalty payments to Novartis on net sales of Jakafi in the United States.","In 2015, we expect R&D expense to be in the range of $450 million to $500 million. This includes non-cash stock compensation expense of approximately $40 million to $45 million. The increase in R&D expense over 2014 includes the investments we are making across the clinical portfolio as well as upfront in some ongoing costs related to the Agenus alliance. Included in this amount is an upfront one-time payment to Agenus of $25 million.","We expect SG&A expense to be in the range from $180 million to $200 million for full year 2015. This includes non-cash stock compensation of $30 million to $35 million. This moderate increase in SG&A expenses is primarily result of additional programs to support ongoing commercialization of Jakafi in MF and PV.","We expect our interest expense this year to be $49 million including a non-cash charge of $36 million related primarily to the amortization of the discount on our convertible senior notes. ","So as we enter 2015, the company has never been in a stronger financial position than it is today to fund our expanding pipeline.","Finally, I'd like to thank Pam Murphy, our VP of IR and Corporate Communications, for all that she has done for Incyte over the past 12 years. Pam has announced to intentionally retire at the end of April this year and we wish the best of luck in her retirement. As part of the planned transition within IR Group we\u2019ve promoted Mike Booth to VP, Investor Relations, and he will now be day-to-day contact person with The Street.","Operator, that concludes our formal remarks. Please open up the call for Q&A.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019ll be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions].","Our first question today is coming from Eric Schmidt from Cowen & Company. Please proceed with your question.","Eric Schmidt","Thanks for taking the question. Pam, we\u2019re going to miss you very much, but congrats to Mike and for that matter, Dave, on the new positions. Let\u2019s see, question maybe for Jim on Jakafi, and the quarter-on-quarter growth you saw; you mentioned that was 8%; its down a little bit, even last quarter I think organic growth for that 11%. So was there any inventory or the fluctuations or did you just not pick anything yet from the PV launch? How do you reconcile?","Jim Daly","Sure, Eric. Well if you look at total demand for the quarter, Eric, we grew 7% with dispense bottles and we had 5% on price for again total demand of 12%. Now that was partially offset by inventory. If you remember, we finished the third quarter with a $4 million inventory build due to price speculation in advance of the October 1 price increase.","So in the fourth quarter, we essentially burned off that $4 million and we did not see an inventory build at the end of the fourth quarter. So as a result, we finished the fourth quarter at the low end, at the very low-end of our normal range of 3 to 3.5 weeks.","And with respect to PV contribution, we really expected de minimis contribution from PV in December and that\u2019s what we saw.","Eric Schmidt","Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Ian Somaiya","Thanks. And Pam, again, we are really going to miss you. Mike will do an adequate job but I think you are always going to be our favorite. Having said that, just I have maybe a follow-up question to Eric, and Eric focus on 4Q; I was really curious about 2015 guidance. Again, you are basically pointing the numbers that are higher than what most of us were looking for. I was curious if you were to just help us think about what the contribution is from myelofibrosis, continuing contribution from there versus the incremental pickup from PV just keeping in mind that historically you said expected very slow steady launch in PV.","Jim Daly","Ian, I think the answer is almost contained within your question. Again, the low-end of the guidance still reflects a 47% year-over-year growth. It does reflect the uncertainties we have with the ramp of PV, but it does assume that we continue to grow MF and that we have a meaningful contribution from PV. And clearly the high-end of the guidance with 58% percentage growth assumes a faster ramp from PV largely and a consistent steady growth in MF. And at this point, we really can\u2019t add much more quantitatively than that.","Ian Somaiya","Okay. And just one other point I was just hoping to clarify was R&D guidance of 2015. I was hoping that or I was thinking that with the baricitinib trial including in 2015 that the R&D would start to come down. Is that just something we should expect to occur 2016?","David Hastings","Yes, so baricitinib, our contribution to baricitinib will be less this year than last year but not a whole lot less, but there will be a significant drop-off in the baricitinib support in 2016. And then the overall growth represents new programs that are getting more advanced Phase III programs and late Phase II programs so the overall is an increase from last year.","Ian Somaiya","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Steve Byrne from Bank of America-Merrill Lynch. Please proceed with your question.","Steve Byrne","Yes, I have -- and this was probably directed to Reid. Based on your understanding of the effects of JAK-STAT Inhibition on the tumor environment, do you see the anti-tumor effects as been primarily a direct impact on the tumor versus enabling other targeted inside of toxic therapies being more effective or the third bucket being restoring that patient's immune system? Is it all of the above or one more than other based on your understanding of the mechanism of action?","Reid Huber","Yes, thanks for the question, Steve; it\u2019s a good one and as you can appreciate it a difficult one to tease out in the clinic at least at the stage of development where we are right now. As you pointed out, there are data to support the role of JAKs inhibitions both in a cell intrinsic manner in terms of supporting the direct proliferation and growth of the tumor there is certainly data that supports the role for JAKs Inhibition in attenuating the effect of targeted or cytotoxic chemotherapy and that is certainly an important mechanism. And as we'll talk about more of a outline at JPMorgan and we'll present more at ACR this year in April, there is an emerging data set including data derived from our own group here that JAK-STAT inhibition can shape the intertumoral micro environment.","Exactly how those three aspects of the biology play out in any one histologic setting is difficult to say. I think what's important is they all support the potential for JAK inhibition in a solid tumor settings; they help contribute to our confidence in continuing this for ruxolitinib in solid tumors and I think very much substantiates our interest in JAK1 selective inhibition in the solid tumor landscape as well.","Steve Byrne","And just regarding that last bucket or last comment, would you see potential for it to be used in combination with other immune therapies that are either driving a stronger T-cell response or the checkpoint inhibitors; do you see much opportunities for synergy in those combinations?","Reid Huber","Sure, we think there is a potential there. Again, those will be data that we'll describe a little bit more in detail at ACR. Exactly what the development program looks like for JAK1 and how those specific combinations evolve over the course of the year is still up for discussion, but I would say that\u2019s something that we are very interested in thinking through carefully.","Steve Byrne","Okay. And just one for Jim. How would you view the outlook in this 25,000 patient targeted market in PV is in terms of what you think is a realistic peak penetration?","Jim Daly","Well I think our goal is always to have a 51% share of the addressable population. I think we would be disappointed if after a defensive commitment of educational resources we couldn\u2019t get half of the patients who need this product on it. Now the question is how long that\u2019s going to take? And as we've said, it's going to take time and its going to take education in order to increase the sense of urgency for patients to identify these patients and to identify them as appropriate candidate for Jakafi.","Operator","Our next question today is coming from Matt Roden from UBS. Please proceed with your question.","Andrew Peters","Hey, guys, it's actually Andrew Peters in for Matt; I wanted to add my congratulations and say that we'll miss Pam as well. First question for Jim, I guess. You mentioned kind of the uncontrolled PV patients currently in practice. I just wanted to understand I guess a little bit more on the dynamics there and why is there a little bit less urgency to get those patients treated and why you wouldn\u2019t expect a bolus from kind of the need to treat patients?","And then the second one for Rich, just looking at kind of the Jakafi solid tumor trials that are ongoing, given kind of the unfortunate kind of short outcomes for the colorectal patients, just want to understand if there is any potential for earlier than expected readouts from the data maybe by the end of 2015 just from a timing perspective? Thanks.","Jim Daly","Yes. I'll take the uncontrolled PV question first. Question, why wouldn't you expect to see a bolus patients or more rapid initial uptake? I think there are several parts for the answer. I think the first is just the nature of the disease. It's viewed as a chronic, less severe disease with less of an urgent need to intervene on the part of physicians. Number two, I think there's still a lot of need for education in terms of disease burden and, specifically, which patients are at greatest risk for complications of uncontrolled PV. Add then, finally, the patients who are most acute, most obvious are already on the drug for PV due to the commercial availability. So that's why we didn't see a bolus of patients going on the product at time of approval, unlike MF where you simply do not have commercial availability.","Now, if you think about why it takes time for physicians to work through that progression, our reps have to go in and it takes multiple calls for them to educate physicians on the data themselves on the response trial. Then they have to translate that to the indication statement, which is patients' who are inadequate -- who have inadequate response to or intolerant of, that's a relatively abstract indication and our reps have to work closely with the physicians to translate that into specific patients. And they are doing that right now, but again, that takes time. And the good news is that the challenges in the PV marketplace are all addressable and we are making good progress in addressing them.","Rich Levy","So this is Rich on your question about the colorectal study. So we certainly took into account the relatively short survival in these last-line patients when we came up with original estimates of data in 2016. The study is enrolling well, but that remains the great limiting step to when we have enough patients and enough unfortunately depth to analyze the study. So I would still guide to data in '16 and think that data in 2015 is almost impossible.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Salveen Richter from the SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Please proceed with your question.","Salveen Richter","Thanks for taking my question. Pam we will miss you, and Mike, congrats. A two pipeline question. Firstly, so how did your second PI3K\u03b4 differ from the first? And are you looking for combinations with JAK molecules and with IDO here? And then secondly, on baricitinib, any details on the nephropathy data, when we might see that? And then how we should think about the alopecia opportunity?","Rich Levy","Yes. So first starting with the delta inhibitors. The second of the delta inhibitors, I said in my prepared remarks was more potent, also has absolutely no liver toxicity in preclinical models. And with 40093, at the doses that we are studying, it's clean but it limits how high you might be able to go. So 50465 has the potential to go to even higher levels of inhibition. We don't know whether that would be clinically relevant or not.","Secondly, we do intend to look at combinations with JAK1 with the combination but at this point in time, we are still in the dose finding portion as monotherapy and the combinations will start relatively soon.","And with respect to the Lilly diabetic nephropathy data, we expect data to be in the public domain in the first half of the year, including presentation at a scientific meeting if accepted our abstracts that are going to be submitted are accepted to the intended meetings.","Salveen Richter","Okay. Great. How we should think about alopecia [indiscernible] --","Rich Levy","Okay. Can you repeat that question?","Salveen Richter","How we should think about alopecia and what you might do there going forward?","Rich Levy","Yes. So as was reported, publicly the oral ruxolitinib which was used by investigators at Columbia University showed very dramatic responses in terms of alopecia. And we have the exclusive rights to our topical ruxolitinib product. And we are planning to start a study later this year in patients with alopecia areata to determine whether a topical formulation can be as or nearly as effective as the oral formulation seem to be. So we might be able to provide greater details on that specifies of that study, should we -- at the time when that's posted on clinicaltrials.gov and we'd hope that there would be data also next year.","Salveen Richter","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Brian Abrahams from Wells Fargo Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Brian Abrahams","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. And my congratulations to Pam as well on your retirement and to Mike for new position. There was an interesting article published in the Journal yesterday about order of JAK2 and Type 2 mutations determining clinical manifestations and sensitivity to ruxolitinib. So I'm just wondering if this finding might have any practical, commercial implications in terms of what it might mean, could this get physicians to intervene earlier in the course of the disease. And then separately on the earlier stage pipeline, wonder if you can talk a little bit about the FGF inhibitor and sort of what differentiates that from some of the other small molecules in development perhaps in terms of its selectivity profile and [indiscernible], thanks.","Rich Levy","Yes, sure so I think the FGFR question first and then we'll discuss briefly the first question. So FGFR, it\u2019s a competitive space; we recognize that and the field has evolved quite a lot over the last few years now with a number of VEGFR sparing FGFR selective inhibitors. And those are showing a very interesting clinical profile and they've shown the first objective responses in patients with FGFR mutated solid tumors those have been seen in squamous cell lung, bladder cancer and ever in glioblastoma.","As we look at the programs that are ahead of us and we study those molecules carefully, we think that the best in class molecule has not yet been made, and our effort internally over the last year and a half was to try to develop, discover and develop that compound. So we like the preclinical profile of 54828 both in terms of potency, selectivity, PK and safety and what the challenge is now in the development side is to try to leverage the learnings from the competitors in this space to make much more efficient expeditious Phase I proof of concept clinical program. We have a companion diagnostic effort that\u2019s well underway in parallel with this program and if the drug lives up to its preclinical billing we're going to look to try to move that molecule and that companion diagnostic forward as rapidly as we can.","In terms of the paper you mentioned, I'm not aware of the paper, so I don\u2019t want to comment on it. I might see if Jim wants to say anything about earlier use in MF as to how physicians get comfortable with the drug. But I certainly don\u2019t want to comment on a publication I haven't read.","Jim Daly","The only journal I read yesterday was The Wall Street Journal not the -- not the New England Journal so I don\u2019t think I can make an informed comment either.","Brian Abrahams","Okay. That's fair enough, and then may be just quick follow up for Jim. I think in response to one of the earlier questions you sort of suggested that the patients with PV at that grade need or may already have been on Jakafi, given it was commercially available. Can you give us any sense of just the proportion of patients on Jakafi who had PV I guess prior to the launch just sort of can may be tour up a little bit better how to think about what the existing kind of unmet need that remains in the second patient and how to think about the ramp going forward? Thank you.","Jim Daly","Sure, Brian. Brian, we don\u2019t want to get into specific numbers, but what I can tell you is that we did not see any increase in the non-MF usage leading up to the approval. Now there is two ways that a PV patient could be on Jakafi. One is if the physician wrote for the product, coded the patient as PV and the patient received it as a non-MF reimbursement.","The other is that the patient was quite frankly continuing between PV and MF and the patient was coated with MF and receive the product. So it's very hard to lineate with precision how much PV business did we have prior to the formal approval. But again, we did not see any increase in non-MF use as based on coding prior to the approval.","Brian Abrahams","That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks again.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Cory Kasimov from JPMorgan Chase. Please proceed with your question.","Whitney Ijem","Hi, good morning, everyone. This is Whitney on for Cory. I'd like to add my congratulations to Pam as well. You will be missed. I guess question that might sort of go to an earlier one but earlier this year you guys talked about synergies between JAK inhibition and IDO specifically. Any color you can give there in terms of how should we be thinking about the pass forward there; is that kind of the AACR data that we should be looking for for more clarity?","Jim Daly","Yes, so that\u2019s exactly why we'll be presenting the data at AACR and have a pretty full discussion of the potential impact of the date on our own clinical development efforts there. A little bit of tour say exactly what the next steps are but I would say that that combination, potentially the combinations are certainly on the table to consider.","Whitney Ijem","Great, and then not sure you'll comment but I'll ask. Can you give any color on where you are in terms of dose escalation in the IDO pembro study with an eye towards the when the expansion phase cold get going?","Rich Levy","Yes, so because of our established relationships with each of these companies who don\u2019t want company number two to get information from company numbers one on where the doses are. We really can\u2019t comment, but things are going very well. The Merck study has been underway since last summer, and basically the design is that you enroll three patients, you wait two months and everything goes well, you move up to the next if you needed to, enroll another cohort because of any events you would do that again. So things are progressing well, but I can\u2019t be quantitative as to where the data are. But we are optimistic that we will be well into the expansion Phases this year not only with the Merck compound but most likely with others as well.","Whitney Ijem","Great, thanks for the taking the questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Josh Schimmer from Piper Jaffray. Please proceed with your question.","Josh Schimmer","Great, thanks for taking the question. My congrats as well to Pam and Mike, and also my congrats to the topical JAK inhibitor, which I think Pam will appreciate. A quick question for Reid actually. There's a myriad of targets in oncology to choose from. Maybe you can help us understand the theme that links the clinical stage programs BRD PI3-Kinase, FGFR 3 and it's tough to understand the prioritization process and why this is the right fit for in the Incyte portfolio? Thanks.","Reid Huber","Yes, thanks, Josh, good question. I think one of the luxuries that we have as a discovery organization now that is different, let's say, from the situation seven or eight years ago is that we have a growing pipeline now that we can consider as sort of tools in the toolbox and look differently at new potential programs as to how they may fit in synergistic ways with other agents in our pipeline.","The delta program, as you know, was really advanced in very large part because of the reason and synergies that we've observed with JAK1 and potentials that we thought we could bring the bear in terms of combination regimens in lymphoma disease.","It\u2019s a similar line of thinking as we look at programs like the bromodomain inhibitor program, which is a very novel mechanism, but one that has shown a very broad activity in hemalignancies[ph] and even has the potential in some solid tumor settings. So there is a lot more we don\u2019t know about BRD inhibition than we do know. But the internal data shows quite nicely synergies with JAK1 inhibition even with PI3K\u03b4 inhibition and some of those data will be presented with the AACR.","So I think that's one underlying theme of the early discovery portfolio is trying to leverage in club or ways the existing clinical portfolio to come up with novel, novel combination and to believe that those sorts of regiments will put us in a much more advantageous competitive position going forward.","A program like FGFR while its sort of doesn't follow that same exact rule in terms of combinations, although it could, really gives us an accelerated path to approval. And so those kind of opportunities will always look very careful at, and when we can be opportunistic to have a very, very rapid Phase I to proof of concept to registration program those kinds of efforts will really have a targeted population, as you can appreciate, rise up to the top of the list pretty quickly.","Josh Schimmer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our next question today is coming from Thomas Wei from Jefferies. Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wei","Thanks. Just wanted to get a little bit more detail on how the original IDO FBE[ph] trial has matured and what exactly we should be expecting to see at ASCO in terms of patients and doses? And then also just on this PV launch initially, I know you are still early in it and there isn't much to share. But what have you -- have you learned anything from some of the early feedback here that's different, more positive, negative, the higher end of the guidance here, maybe a signal that you've seen some things that have surprised you positively in this market? Any help would be great.","Rich Levy","So I'll answer your first question. So with respect to the IDO [indiscernible] remember that this is not a combination that we are pursuing at this time. We do plan to give an update on the data. In collaboration with the investigators it was decided that we will have a more robust data set for presentation at ASMO rather than ASCO, so that is the current plan. But in terms of what to expect, we have about somewhere close to 40 patients that are now included in that data set, was a little bit less in 20 I think at the ASCO presentation in 2014. So not only will you have a larger number of patients but you also have longer-term follow-up not only on the patients that were talked about last year but even with waiting for the data for ASMO longer-term follow-up on the patients who have been enrolled in the past year.","Jim Daly","And Thomas, in terms of PV it is extremely early. So I think the only thing we can share with you are preliminary impressions. But I'll give you a few impressions. First one, including the patients that are there, having been out with the representatives, these patients who are poorly managed on hydrea they are definitely there. Now it requires multiple representative visits in order to identify them.","As we talked about in the past, docs tend to be lumpers; when you ask them about their PV patients, they tend to generalize and say they're doing fine. It isn't [indiscernible] focus on the minority of patients, but it's an important minority who are either experiencing tolerability issues with hydrea. Hematocrit is above 45. It isn't until you are able to focus on those patients that you really get traction. And that takes multiple visits.","From an access and reimbursement perspective, I think things are going according to plan. Prior authorizations are consistent with the label and patient out-of-pocket costs have been reasonable and very manageable. But again it's very early. I think it's too early to call victory on access and reimbursement.","We have been pleasantly surprised by the uptick of samples. I think there is a good rationale to use samples in PV. It's a symptomatic disease with a measurable treatment target. The benefits of Jakafi are manifest pretty early. So it really is an ideal situation to use samples to create risk free trial, generate positive experience and create an autocatalytic process. So the sample uptick has been robust. Now it's going to take time to see how that translates into patients on pain drug, how long it takes and what type of pull through we get, but the initial sample uptake has been positive.","So as we look at all the puts and takes I'd say we remain pretty balanced and realistic in our view of the commercial potential in PV, but again our conviction is high that it represents a major opportunity to improve care for patients and a major opportunity for our business.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Ian Somaiya from Nomura Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Ian Somaiya","Hi, thanks for the follow up. Just wanted to figure out or confirm timing for the baricitinib diabetic nephropathy trial. According to clinic trials that trial finished in the fourth quarter. And just a question for Reid. Just was wondering if you have any programs or any development activities related to CDK4\/6 inhibitors?","Jim Daly","Do you want to take the first one, Rich?","Rich Levy","So the diabetic nephropathy study, as I said, I think intense to submit the data to a scientific meeting and one possibility for example would be the ADA meetings in June, but they're not willing to comment on exactly what the likelihood of that is in terms of being presented. So I think that\u2019s when the data will come out. It's not something that I think they feel like they need to top line immediately as was the case with their Phase III registration studies in RA.","Reid Huber","Yes, and with respect to the CDK4\/6, it\u2019s an interesting mechanism, but it\u2019s not one that we are pursuing internally although we certainly keep our eyes on it and may be an important point of combination with some other agents in the emerging pipeline.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question today is coming from Liisa Bayko from JMP Securities. Please proceed with your question.","Liisa Bayko","Hi, thanks for taking the question. Just to ask a little bit more about the alopecia. Do you think this was something specific to ruxolitinib, is it a JAK1\/2 phenomenon? I mean the results in a couple of people look pretty spectacular, what's driving this? Have you seen that as a kind of side effect benefit for other patients in MF? Trying to understand the magnitude.","Reid Huber","Yes, so we believe the JAK1s would probably work as well as JAK1\/2s, but we don't have models and we haven\u2019t done the experiments to be able to prove that, but we do know that ruxolitinib has a JAK1\/2 works incredibly well as an oral and we believe that we can get drug into the hair follicle topically and, therefore, it may have benefit there as well. But in terms of what may emerge over the years as other potential therapies and what their profiles might be I can\u2019t really say.","Liisa Bayko","The results that we are seeing what doses where they using there?","Reid Huber","I think they were generally starting at around 20 mg BID, but I don\u2019t remember whether they set at those patients needed any dose adjustment so they just stated at 20. But that doesn\u2019t mean that a dose of 5, 10 or 15 and I wouldn\u2019t -- I would suspect 5 is going to be less effective but for most things we see with ruxolitinib 10 mg BID is a very good dose, so and may very well have worked similarly at lower doses as well, but they just don\u2019t have that data either.","Liisa Bayko","And your vision for the topical, would that be like a cream or some sort of solution? I\u2019m just trying to understand what the --","Reid Huber","So the only formulation that we\u2019ve developed is the cream. If the proof of concept study in alopecia is positive, then either us alone or us with a partner or potential licensee and all those things are possible, might then decide to develop other formulations. For the long term might be a better option for some people in certain circumstances, but the cream is a very nice formulation and can certainly not only be used to do the study but we think it could be a successful commercial product on its own should the results be positive.","Liisa Bayko","And is there any anecdotal evidence just kind of commercial setting where you\u2019ve had obviously a lot of patients with MF and PV I guess?","Reid Huber","I\u2019m not aware of that per see, it maybe and we were never told. But I think if I remember correctly, I think that tofacitinib, which is the Pfizer drug, might have had an on label use of the drug and the patient that happened to also have alopecia, and that might have been what led to the clinical study at Columbia. But I also think that the Columbia group is very focused in the biology and believe that JAK inhibition should work, and that was not based on anecdotal report but based on the science and then proven in the clinic.","And I don\u2019t know what their plans are to potentially give any updates on the clinical data that was reported I think in Nature Medicine last year.","Liisa Bayko","Okay, fair enough, enough on that. For FGFR, have you said which R you're targeting?","Jim Daly","I think we have, Liisa, at FGFR 1, 2 and 3","Liisa Bayko","Okay. And then you said there was a PV some up level usage singling on for a while can you maybe characterize and someway like how many patients or percentage-wise to get a sense of that?","Reid Huber","Liisa, I think it will be false precision; we really don\u2019t want to get into a specific quantitative assessment of that. It\u2019s been relative small portion of our overall business and again we\u2019ve not seen an increase prior to the approval.","Liisa Bayko","Okay. And then final question, you kind of commented that you had moved swiftly forward with IDO, some of the combinations look promising. Could that be a '15 event or is that a '16 event? That\u2019s my last question. Thank you.","Reid Huber","You mean in terms of a data with IDO in terms of in combination with the PD-1s or PD-L1s?","Liisa Bayko","Exactly. Moving you said sort of expressly moving toward -- that would be next year ","Reid Huber","Yes, we still think that the data is most likely to come out in '16. For the data to be clear enough to talk about in \u201815 things would need to move very rapidly in the results in a small number of patients would need to be very clear. So, nothing is impossible but I think the expectation should be \u201915 -- \u201916 data presentation of IDO information.","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ve reached the end of our question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over Mr. Hoppenot for any further or closing comments.","Herv\u00e9 Hoppenot","Okay.

A brief question-and-answer session will follow the formal presentation.  (Operator instructions.)   As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.  It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Ms. Pamela Murphy, Vice President Investor Relations and Communications.  Thank you Ms. Murphy, you may now begin.","Pamela Murphy","Good morning and welcome to Incyte\u2019s Q2 2012 conference call.  On the call today are Paul Friedman, Incyte\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer; Pat Andrews, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer; Dave Hastings, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Rich Levy, Executive Vice President and Chief Drug Development and Medical Officer.  Pat is traveling outside of the country right now and is therefore not in the room with us.  Paul will begin with a brief overview of the quarter, Pat will update you on the product launch of Jakafi, and Dave will describe the Q2 2012 financial results.  ","Prior to opening the call for Q&A Paul will close with a summary of some of our other programs.  Before beginning we\u2019d like to remind you that some of the statements made during the call today are forward-looking statements including statements regarding our expectations for the launch and commercialization of Jakafi, our product revenue guidance as well as our development plan.  These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results to differ materially including those described in our Form 10(q) for the quarter ended March 31, 2012 and from time to time in our other SEC documents.  Paul?","","Paul Friedman","Good morning.  The launch of Jakafi for patients with intermediate or high-risk Myelofibrosis continues to go well and is pretty much right on the forecasts that we\u2019ve made.  During Q2 we shipped $35.1 million of Jakafi to our specialty pharmacies compared to $25.1 million in Q1.  As Pat will describe in greater detail we\u2019re seeing steady growth in the use of Jakafi by hematologists and oncologists.","Since the pace of the launch is going as we expected, we\u2019re providing revenue guidance for 2012 net product sales in the range of $120 million to $135 million.  This range reflects our continued belief that the growth will be steady and gradual as physicians move from prescribing Jakafi for more severely ill MF patients to using the product in less severely ill patients, specifically patients with any degree of splenomegaly and\/or symptoms.","The drug provides dramatic relief in spleen reduction and in symptom improvement and additionally, as we shared with you last quarter, further analysis of COMFORT 1 first published in The New England Journal of Medicine further suggests that there may be a survival advantage for Jakafi over placebo.  In that regard, more recently [Doctor Bershtofstick] et al published an article in the journal Blood regarding their analysis of 107 MF patients from our Phase I\/II study.  In the article, the authors state that in this group of patients followed for a median of 32 months there could be a survival advantage with ruxolitinib treatment when compared to historic controls who had similar patient entry criteria.","Now, while there are clearly limitations to these comparisons to historical controls, the authors also state that the data suggests a survival benefit from ruxolitinib independent of any comparison with a historical control group.  Specifically, survival in the high-risk patients treated with ruxolitinib was consistent with that of intermediate II risk patients.  The published data states that the normal life expectancy for high-risk patients is approximately two years compared to four years for intermediate II risk patients.  This would suggest a very meaningful improvement in survival.","In early June there were a number of Jakafi posters presented as ASCO, all of which are available from our website. One I want to highlight which is also the subject of an oral presentation at EHA is for the ongoing Phase II study in patients with baseline platelet counts between 50,000 and 100,000 who as you may recall were excluded from the Phase III trials but are part of the indication in the label.  In this study we start patients with a dose of 5 mg twice daily and allow for dose modifications based on adequate platelet counts.  ","At the time of this interim analysis the majority of patients had optimized their dose to 10 mg twice daily or higher, and for patients completing the week 24 visit most experienced reductions in spleen size and improvements in symptoms to a degree that is comparable to what we saw at 15 mg and 20 mg twice a day in the Phase III trials.  I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Pat who will provide you with more details on the launch; Dave will follow with an update about our financial performance for Q2, and I\u2019ll conclude by providing an update on our other ongoing programs.  Pat?","Patricia Andrews","Thanks, Paul.  Good morning.  We\u2019re going to start with a few metrics that may help you appreciate the basis for the guidance we\u2019re now providing.  I\u2019m pleased to say that we were able to increase the number of physicians who have used Jakafi from over 1000 reported in Q1 to over 1600 in Q2.  We\u2019re building a broad base of subscribers, of which about 80% are from the community; and since launch, these community hematologists\/oncologists have generated about 75% of the prescription volumes.","We\u2019re targeting approximately 6500 hematologists\/oncologists, most of whom are community-based.  Unlike the key opinion leaders, these physicians each tend to have only a handful of MF patients, usually less than five.  About 25% of our targeted physicians have prescribed Jakafi, and according to our market research, most physicians who have not yet prescribed the product say that they are likely to.  Their primary reason for not using the product yet tends to be \u201cI\u2019m just waiting for the right patient.\u201d ","Our market research suggests that what they mean by \u201cthe right patient\u201d is one who has a very large spleen and a fairly heavy symptom burden.  Now, our label states that Jakafi is indicated for the treatment of patients with intermediate or high-risk MF.  The label doesn\u2019t specify the degree of splenomegaly or symptom burden required for use, and we fully expect to see use in less severely ill MF patients \u2013 patients with any degree of splenomegaly or symptoms \u2013 continue to grow over the next several years.","We estimate that intermediate and high-risk patients represent about 80% to 90% of all Myelofibrosis patients and we continue to believe that there are between 16,000 and 18,500 MF patients in the United States.  Therefore, to capture this market opportunity, a top priority for us is educating as many as possible of the 6500 healthcare professionals who treat these patients to help them understand who the right patient is.  We\u2019re doing this through a steady systematic combination of direct calls by our field force, exhibits and displays at conferences, direct advertising, multichannel communications and educational efforts including speaker programs.","We\u2019re confident that once a physician sees firsthand that Jakafi truly works to make a meaningful difference in how a patient with Myelofibrosis feels \u2013 it is generally well tolerated and the associated side effects are generally well managed \u2013 that he or she will be open to and appreciate the data that show that patients with MF who go untreated or who are treated with historical best available care worsen over time and they worsen fairly quickly.  That is why we\u2019re confident over time physicians will see the value in using Jakafi in their immediate or high-risk MF patients with any degree of splenomegaly or symptoms, and why we continue to expect our peak share in MF to occur about three years from the launch \u2013 around the same time that we expect to have an indication in polycythemia vera.","I\u2019ll now describe a few other factors that we think are relevant to the launch as well as the ultimate use of Jakafi.  First, some of the earliest patients who were prescribed Jakafi were very advanced, so ill they would not have been eligible for the Phase III trial in which life expectancy had to be at least six months.  The second point is that the discontinuation rate seen in COMFORT 1 and COMFORT 2 of 14% and 18% at 24 weeks and 48 weeks respectively are probably a good reference point for the low end of the discontinuation rates we are likely to see commercially.  And for length of therapy, remember that at the ongoing Phase I\/II study at MD Anderson about 50% of patients were still on drug at three years.","On another subject, nearly all payers have Jakafi on formulary.  Preauthorization is required maybe two-thirds of the time which can slow down the initial script, but it is nearly always approved for on-label use of Jakafi.  About 50% of patients have been covered commercially; about 70% of these patients have had copays of less than $100 a month.  About one-third of all patients have been covered by Medicare Part D.  Nearly all Medicare Part D patients have been covered under the standard benefit design and many have sought and have been able to access funds through charitable foundations.  A small percent of patients have Medicaid or seek care through other government programs such as the VA, a [340D\u2019s], or Tricare; and as expected, between 10% and 15% of patients have received free drug.","To summarize, the launch continues to go well.  We\u2019re very pleased with our current level of market penetration in MF and look forward to seeing a gradual increase in the number of patients on drug, a steady increase in physician interest and use, a greater appreciation among those physicians and patients that MF is a progressive life-threatening disease that worsens over time, and that treatment with Jakafi provides compelling and important clinical benefits to patients with any degree of splenomegaly or symptoms.","Importantly, Myelofibrosis is just the beginning and we look forward to seeing the use of Jakafi grow with future indications in polycythemia vera and potentially other cancers.  With that I\u2019ll turn the call over to Dave.","Dave Hastings","Thanks, Pat, and good morning everybody.  Let\u2019s start with product revenue this morning.  It\u2019s important to note that we are still using the sell through method for revenue recognition which means we defer revenue until the specialty pharmacy ships the product to the patient.  We anticipate transitioning to the sell in method later this year at which time we will recognize when our product is received by the specialty pharmacy.  Therefore, our 2012 net revenue guidance of $120 million or $135 million assumes this transition takes place and that revenue deferred as a result of the sell through method is recognized this year.","As noted in the press release, this deferred revenue amounts to approximately $9 million net as of June 30.  As Paul mentioned for the quarter ended June 30 we shipped $35.1 million of product to our specialty pharmacies and reported gross revenue of $31.9 million.  Our gross net adjustment for product revenue recognized in Q2 was approximately $2.2 million resulting in a net product revenue of $29.7 million under the sell through method.  Had we been reporting under the sell in method our net revenue would have been approximately $32.7 million.  The difference between the two methods, about $3 million net, was added to deferred revenue.","Our gross net adjustment includes the following: fees to our specialty pharmacies, rebates to governmental payers, our share of the donut hole for Medicare Part D patients, co-pay assistance to eligible privately insured patients, and any product returns.  Our cost of goods sold was immaterial as our starting finished goods inventory was previously expensed with R&D prior to FDA approval; and in terms of operating expenses, both R&D and SG&A were within our expectations.","In terms of cash we ended the quarter in a strong position with $262 million in cash and investments excluding $9.5 million of restricted cash held in escrow for interest payments through October, 2012, on our 4.75% convertible senior notes.  So with that I\u2019ll turn the call back to Paul.  Paul?","Paul Friedman","Thanks.  So before opening for Q&A I\u2019m going to give a brief description of some of the other programs in the pipeline.  First, the Phase II and Phase III long-term extension trials in Myelofibrosis are continuing.  Second, we anticipate patient recruitment in our pivotal P vera trial to complete this year so what we\u2019ve guided is where we think we\u2019ll end up here, which keeps us on track for a potential approval in the second half of 2014.  Third, we\u2019ve recently initiated a second study in PV patients called RELIEF.  It evaluates symptom improvements in ruxolitinib-treated patients as compared to hydroxyurea-treated patients.  And although it\u2019s not required for approval we intend to submit results of this study to support labeling claims [of a symptomatic] benefit for NPB.","Fourth, the Phase II trial in pancreatic cancer is well on its way to enrolling the approximately 130 patients with results anticipated next year.  Fifth, the three-month data from the Phase II-B trial in rheumatoid arthritis for baricitinib, our JAK1 and JAK2 inhibitor partnered with Lily were presented at EULAR in June.  The results were impressive.  The six-month data are expected to be presented later in 2012 and we continue to expect that the Phase III program will start this year.","Lastly, our early stage oncology programs for c-MET and Indoleamine dioxygenase or IDO are progressing, and I or Rich can address any questions you may have about them in Q&A.  And we have other ongoing clinical development programs in oncology and inflammation \u2013 I anticipate describing these proprietary programs at the appropriate time.  With that, Operator, let\u2019s open the call for Q&A.","","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you.  We will now be conducting the question-and-answer session.  (Operator instructions.)  Thank you.  Our first question is from the line of Matt Roden with UBS.  Please proceed with your question.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS ","Thanks very much for taking the question. I was hoping that we could talk a little bit more about the guidance.  Considering that you\u2019ll be changing the revenue recognition for the full year, if I\u2019m doing the math right here it seems to suggest that demand could be modestly up to even sequentially down in the second half.  So first of all, can you correct me if I\u2019m thinking about this the right way?  And then can you comment on whether or not this is just conservatism on your part or whether or not it reflects something that you\u2019re seeing in the field that gives you the sense that momentum is slowing?  I guess what we\u2019re trying to get at is why could demand be sequentially down in the second half.","Paul Friedman","So I\u2019ll let Dave and Pat add to this, but I\u2019ll just say you have to remember it\u2019s the first product in this therapeutic area; it\u2019s the first JAK inhibitor approved for any indication and we\u2019re about six months into this.  We\u2019ve evaluated a number of different scenarios and we\u2019ve developed a range of outcomes that we believe reflects a launch that is proceeding well.  And it\u2019s expected to grow at a steady, gradual pace.  We did see in Q1 and late last year an influx of patients who were quite sick, could not get into the Phase III trials and were queued up to get into our studies.  So I wouldn\u2019t call that a bolus but I will say that revenues in Q1 were somewhat higher than our forecasts.","Since that time, we are I\u2019d say slightly ahead of our forecast and right where we think the launch should be.  But I\u2019ll let Pat and Dave comment on your question as well.","Dave Hastings","Yeah, just on the growth question you know, even on gross shipments the low end of the range does imply growth in the high teens, and certainly on the higher end of the range higher growth than that.  So Matt, there is growth second half compared to first half.","Patricia Andrews","And I\u2019ll just add that one of the factors driving our guidance range is the time it will take for us to evolve from the use of Jakafi in more severely ill patients that Paul was referencing to less severely ill, specifically the moderate to mild MF patients with any degree of splenomegaly or symptoms.  And that you know, will take education and education is a major component of our marketing efforts, and we will help the treating physician who\u2019s not that familiar with Myelofibrosis in the first place because they just don\u2019t have that much experience with it and they need experience with Jakafi to understand who the right patient is.  And then we remain confident that over time this will lead to pretty broad usage within the intermediate and high-risk patient category for patients with any degree of splenomegaly and symptoms.  But it will take some time to get there.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS ","Okay, thanks for that.  And then a question on the new RELIEF study in PV \u2013 does that imply that you could actually wind up with a first-line PV label?  And can you talk about the implications of the study as you see it and whether or not it would be filed as part of your initial filling or as an SNDA?","Paul Friedman","Rich?","Rich Levy","Yeah, so the study compared to hydroxyurea is still in patients that are, we\u2019re starting with a patient population that\u2019s already on hydroxyurea but who are not responding as well as can be by virtue of the fact that they\u2019re still symptomatic, which is one of the parts of the definition of refractoriness to HU.  So I don\u2019t see this as the potential for an actual indication for first line.  The second thing is that this study which is just starting now has a significantly shorter duration of treatment to the endpoint than the ongoing RESPONSE study, so the timing is such that both studies should finish around the same time and both would be included in the initial labeling.  And that\u2019s our current expectation.","Matt Roden \u2013 UBS ","Thanks.  Congrats for all the progress.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Abrahams of Wells Fargo.  Please proceed with your question.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, thanks very much for taking my question and congratulations on the continued strong launch here.  I have two questions.  I guess the first is actually a follow-up on the RELIEF study.  We noticed that some of the inclusion criteria refers to patients who don\u2019t have palpable splenomegaly, and I guess if you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the population you\u2019re planning to enroll in RELIEF as compared to the RESPONSE study.  I guess my impression of that one is the major symptomatic benefits that you could potentially elicit here would be on spleen.  ","So if you could maybe talk a little bit about that, and then just separately I know you have a new compound in Phase II for Myelofibrosis and rheumatoid arthritis \u2013 110.  I\u2019m just wondering if you can generally speak about how that potentially fits into your lifecycle extension strategy for the franchise and what the Phase II timelines might be there.  Thanks very much.","Paul Friedman","Rich, why don\u2019t you do the RELIEF and I\u2019ll try the other one?","Rich Levy","So we didn\u2019t want to directly compete for patients who are still enrolling in RESPONSE, so there are two differences in the patient population to make them not be eligible for both studies.  One is that, well let me just say it a different way.  In RESPONSE you have to have both an enlarged spleen and have to have at least two phlebotomies within the prior six months.  So in RELIEF we said you could have one of those things but not both so there\u2019s no overlap in the entry criteria.  But otherwise they\u2019re very similar except that in RELIEF you have to have symptoms of at least a certain level.","And we also are studying the same endpoints in RESPONSE for symptoms; however that study is not a blinded study so we don\u2019t expect to be able to use that data in the same way.  This study is a fully blinded study and therefore something as subjective as symptomatic improvements really requires a placebo controlled study.  But in both cases you\u2019re still talking about a patient population that would be defined as refractory to hydroxyurea.","Paul Friedman","So with respect to 39-110, it\u2019s a very interesting compound.  We think it has potential in RA, other inflammatory diseases and potentially in Myelofibrosis.  It is our compound and we are not ready to really talk much about its mechanism or clinical results yet.  We want it to mature a little bit before we put it into primetime.  But I can tell you it is an interesting mechanism and it\u2019s an interesting compound.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo","And just to quickly follow up on that, when you say it\u2019s your compound you\u2019re suggesting that this is not something that would fall under any of your existing partnerships I assume?","Paul Friedman","Correct.","Brian Abrahams \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay.  That\u2019s very helpful, thank you so much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of Salveen Richter of Canaccord Genuity.  Please proceed with your question.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Thanks for taking my questions.  I\u2019m just wondering if we can just get some more color here when you\u2019re talking about switching to the sell in method.  Should we assume that that happens in Q3 and the $9 million of deferred revenue will appear that quarter?","Dave Hastings","Most likely, Salveen, but you never know.  But I would think at this point Q3 is the most likely outcome for that, yeah.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Okay, and then just following up on past comments about the discontinuation rate saying 14% to 18% is too low.  What should we be considering then for discontinuation? ","Paul Friedman","Pat, do you want to comment on that?","Patricia Andrews","Sure.  It\u2019s early to say what the discontinuation rate would be.  Usually it\u2019s something that you\u2019ve had longer-term and look retrospectively and say that\u2019s what it was, and so we\u2019re trying to provide what is the longer-term data which is from COMFORT 1 and COMFORT 2 to give you some sense of what we think it would be.  And of course, you know, it\u2019s frequently the case that what you see in commercial practice is higher discontinuation rates than you would see in a clinical study because the study is controlled.  And so we\u2019re trying to remind people what the discontinuation rates were in the studies and we would expect that to be probably the low end of what we see commercially.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Great, and then Pat, just to follow up on your earlier point that the physician is waiting for the right patient and they want a patient who has an enlarged spleen and heavy symptom burden. Do they need to treat that patient first before they go to the less severe patients?","Patricia Andrews","I think for a lot of physicians yes.  I mean I don\u2019t want to generalize about all physicians but yes, because there\u2019s always\u2026 You know, the first priority of the physician is to do no harm and they want to make sure that when a new product is out on the market that it\u2019s going to be appropriate for their patient population.  And if they don\u2019t have a lot of MF patients it does take a while to work their way through patients who are less severely ill, versus it\u2019s a much easier call for patients who are really, really suffering with the disease burden or an incredibly large spleen.  So I feel very confident that we\u2019ll see that over time but it is an over time thing; it\u2019s not something that we would have expected to occur yet.","Salveen Richter \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Great, thank you.","Operator","Our next question is from Ian Somaiya with Piper Jaffray.  Please state your question.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Thanks.  I wanted to just get maybe a better sense from you, Pat, for the types of patients that came on therapy this quarter.  And one of the issues you\u2019d highlighted last quarter given the severity of the patients who were coming onto therapy was the potential for a high rate of dropouts.  Can you just speak to those factors?  And then I\u2019ll have one question, a follow-up to one Brian asked earlier.","Patricia Andrews","Sure, Ian.  Our market research suggests that about 90% of the patients going on drug are intermediate II or high-risk which more closely parallels the Phase III study but it is narrower than what our label is, because our label is actually intermediate or high-risk.  So again, we would expect that over time with more familiarity with the drug that there would be a shift in patient population treated to those less advanced.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","And just on the dropouts?","Patricia Andrews","Well as I said it\u2019s too early to really comment on discontinuation rates or compliance during the duration of therapy, so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve referenced the studies and other data which is long-term.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay.  And on your follow-on, JAK, can you share with us the relative selectivity for JAK-1, for that compound and when we can potentially see data for that product?","Paul Friedman","Well, we haven\u2019t said it\u2019s a JAK inhibitor.  I mean I\u2019m sure your question relates to the [Avid Galapagos], heading in that direction.  That early data in a small number of Moldovans was interesting and let\u2019s see what comes out of their further studies.  I would say, Rich, when do you think we\u2019d have enough data on 39-110 to start talking about it?","Rich Levy","Well, I think in terms of medical meetings we\u2019re probably talking about late spring or early summer next year, but I don\u2019t know for example whether we\u2019d be giving top line results on anything in advance of the next real medical meeting.  So it\u2019s not really that well decided as to what that strategy would be.","Paul Friedman","I think that\u2019s the best answer we can give at this point.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Cory Kasimov with JP Morgan.  Please proceed with your question.","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JP Morgan","Hey, good morning guys.  Thanks for taking the question.  Most of them have been asked already but Dave, a couple for you.  One is that it look like the gross to net was a bit lower in Q2 than Q1, I think about 7% versus 9%.  How should we be thinking about that going forward?  And then also you had mentioned I believe in reference to Matt\u2019s earlier question that at the lower end of your guidance range you\u2019re still looking for I believe it was somewhere in the teens growth rate in the second half.  I just wanted to confirm that\u2019s what you said and maybe if you can give a little bit more behind that math.  Thanks.","Dave Hastings","Sure.  So the growth on average for the first six months is about 8%, Cory, as you mentioned.  It\u2019s a little early to assume that\u2019s going to be the rate going forward.  The driver, the key driver for growth in that is patient mix so that may change over time.  That range, though, has some variability but not significant amounts of variability as you think about gross net going forward.  In terms of growth, I was just looking at we shipped $60 million in the first half and our revenue guidance is net, so you would have to ship more than that to achieve the low end of our net revenue guidance.","Cory Kasimov \u2013 JP Morgan","Okay, I see.  And then lastly just for Paul, I\u2019m just curious quickly on the IDO inhibitor and kind of the interest in this asset coming out of ASCO.  And I know you just recently started a trial with Ipi in melanoma \u2013 any kinds of expectations in terms of how long this trial might take to accrue where we could see some data from it?  Thanks.","Paul Friedman","Again, I\u2019ll pass that on to Rich.  I think it\u2019s going to be a while.","Rich Levy","Yeah, you\u2019re talking about a combination therapy with Ipilimumab in that study where Ipilimumab itself has proven activity.  So it\u2019s not the sort of study where you simply see a response and then say \u201cWell, it must be your drug that\u2019s causing that to happen\u201d because it is a combination study.  So I think it\u2019s going to be a while before we have a sense of that.  We also have a second study starting soon in ovarian cancer where we\u2019re using the drug as monotherapy, and that might potentially give a quicker answer simply because if there\u2019s activity it\u2019s due to your drug and not to the drug that you\u2019re adding on top of it.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Thomas Wei with Jefferies & Co.  Please proceed with your question.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Hi, thanks.  Just wanted to follow up a little bit on the questions that have been asked on discontinuation rates.  Could you be a little bit more specific for maybe patients who have already started?  You\u2019ve described this bolus phenomenon and sicker patients going on \u2013 have you seen kind of a disproportionate rate of early discontinuations already for the patients who had started in Q4 and Q1?  And then also for the growth in the quarter, just doing a little bit of back-of-the-envelope math here, is it fair to say that almost all of the growth in the quarter in terms of new patients who were added was related to these new physicians \u2013 the 1002 over 1600, that they each basically put one patient on drug and that\u2019s almost the entirety of the source of new growth during the quarter?","Paul Friedman","Pat, would you want to [answer that one]?","Patricia Andrews","Sure, Tom, let me answer the second one first.  So the over 1600 physicians who have prescribed Jakafi which we think is a good, solid foundation at this time, seven months into the launch.  The majority of them have indeed only put one patient on drug, and what we see is that we have both new prescribers joining each week and month as well as repeat prescribers.  But we\u2019re still working strongly on broadening our prescribing base because we think that\u2019s really the key to this market, because the patients are dispersed throughout the community and most physicians only have a handful of patients.  So it\u2019s really been our focus and one of the reasons why I have emphasized it in our prepared remarks.","On the discontinuations, again it is very difficult to compare over time because at any point when you look \u2013 you said compare Q1 to Q2.  You know, if they started in Q2, even if they started in April they would have only been on drug for two months.  So I would just encourage people not to over focus in on discontinuations at this time because it\u2019s really hard to know what is a like discontinuation rate and what to expect, which is why we referenced the clinical trials which were of longer duration and you can get a better sense for over time what might be an expected discontinuation rate.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","I guess just to make sure that I understand, when you make those comments on discontinuation, I guess I\u2019m having a hard time interpreting if right now what you\u2019re seeing is a relatively high discontinuation rate that you think will stabilize out to something more normalized even if it\u2019s not as good as the clinical trials; or if actually you\u2019re seeing not very many people discontinuing even though there were sicker patients enrolled to start.","Paul Friedman","So we had early on people whose life expectancies were less than six months were put on the drug and early on we had people discontinue because they died.  That\u2019s washing through, and we are acsentoting to a number that is lower but we don\u2019t have that number yet.  But it\u2019s proceeding as you would expect it to proceed, and I think what Pat has said is that you would expect when we do finally acsentote to a more or less steady state discontinuation rate it\u2019s going to be probably slightly higher than the 14% to 18%, which is what you\u2019d expect out in the field as opposed to a controlled trial.  I don\u2019t think we can be any more precise than that at this point.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","That\u2019s helpful.  And I\u2019m sorry, but just to clarify on the first question that I asked: so if we look at an add of over 600 new physicians during the quarter and basically assume that they each put one patient onto drug, is that basically the source of all of the new patient stream during the quarter \u2013 that the 1000 who prescribed before you did not actually see much progress in getting them to prescribe to other patients?","Patricia Andrews","No actually, Thomas, what I was trying to convey was that we see both repeat prescribers as well as new prescribers and both are growing in Q2 over Q1.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay, great.  ","Paul Friedman","And so just to clarify that first statement or to try to clarify it, what we\u2019re seeing because we obviously track this is an increasing percentage over time of physicians who are putting a second patient and a third patient on drug.  But still at this point in time the majority of physicians have prescribed for a single patient, but it\u2019s moving in the direction of more physicians putting more than a single patient on.  And of course we have individual physicians who\u2019ve put several dozen patients on.  So it\u2019s a mix but the majority of prescribers have prescribed for one patient at this point in time.","Operator","Our next question is coming from the line of Rachel McMinn with Bank of America.  Please proceed with your question.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America","Hi, yeah, I have a similar question; I guess a couple of things.  One is another way of getting at this: was demand from new patients actually steady in Q2 versus Q1?  I think that would help us understand how we should be thinking about the discontinuation rate.  And then I\u2019m still struggling over the guidance I have to say, because if you grew $10 million sequentially in Q2 and you kind of assume that demand would be reasonably steady, and you throw in the $9 million of deferred revenue on top we should be getting to much bigger numbers \u2013 the high end of your guidance should basically be the low end of your guidance.  So I think that\u2019s the part I\u2019m struggling with, and I think when Matt said initially that your guidance assumes falling off in the back half, I think what he was probably referring to was demand; that the number of new patients coming on would be dramatically lower if we go by your guidance.  Thanks.","Paul Friedman","So the number of new patients has not declined week-over-week as we follow it.  It looks good and I will let Dave reiterate what he said before about the guidance and the growth.","Dave Hastings","Yeah.  Again, if you just look at gross shipments for the first half at $60 million, to get to the low end of our net revenue guidance you do have growth in the high teens in terms of gross shipments.  At the high end your growth is in the low 30%\u2019s.  So there is growth, Rachel, in the back half on a like-to-like basis.","","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America","So basically you\u2019re assuming that there\u2019s significant discontinuation rates coming in the back half.","Paul Friedman","No, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s correct.  Pat, do you have anything to add to that?","Patricia Andrews","No, not really.  I feel like we\u2019ve said about as much on discontinuation rates as we can.  We\u2019re not expecting significant discontinuations in the back half beyond what one would expect based on patients staying on drug for six months or one year as you saw in the trials.","Rachel McMinn \u2013 Bank of America","Alright, well I\u2019ll follow up offline.  Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of Tom Russo with Robert W. Baird.  Please proceed with your question.","Tom Russo \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Good morning.  Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I haven\u2019t heard anyone ask yet about the frequency of patient visits.  I\u2019m just curious how that\u2019s comparing to expectations, just thinking about docs getting to learn the experience that their first patient is having and then also maybe seeing the next logical patient walk in the door.","Paul Friedman","Pat?","Patricia Andrews","Sure.  So patients do visit, MF patients do visit their doctor every one, three, six months depending on their level of illness.  And what we\u2019re seeing is that the feedback from the field for doctors who have put that first patient on drug is generally very positive, very encouraging, even surprising in some regards on the physician level.  The drug does more and more dramatically than they expect.  That being said, a lot of them still haven\u2019t put that first patient on drug.  They view the patient as maybe not having such an enlarged spleen or such a burdensome disease that it\u2019s worth taking a risk putting that patient on a new drug.  There\u2019s more of a \u201cWell let\u2019s see a little while longer.\u201d  ","So for me that is all about education and experience, and hearing in professional circles and through education in other forums and through reading in publications for the physician to get comfortable in putting the first patient on and then subsequently, when they have a good experience \u2013 which is not after month one; it can be a longer-term thing \u2013 putting additional patients on.","Tom Russo \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, and are you able to quantify from your market research at all and maybe even provide the trends for awareness, kind of the aided and unaided level of interest and that sort of thing that exists out there today maybe versus at the time of launch, the beginning of the launch?","Patricia Andrews","Sure.  So at launch there was not much awareness of Jakafi \u2013 it was very low.  I don\u2019t want to cite the numbers but it was a low double-digit number on awareness of the product.  And now on an unaided basis it\u2019s more like 70% and on an aided basis it\u2019s pretty much 100%.  So it\u2019s definitely becoming more aware.  There is a difference as you know between awareness and knowledge and comfort, and so awareness is really getting up there.  We still need to work on knowledge and comfort and that will happen over time.","Tom Russo \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, and my last question: over on 050 you reaffirmed expectations to start Phase III before the end of the year, and I was just wondering if you\u2019d share your latest thoughts on design and maybe setting up for success on the structure [and endpoints] too.","Paul Friedman","Rich, you\u2019re closer to this than I am.","Rich Levy","Yes, so I have to be a little bit careful in what I say since Lily hasn\u2019t announced their specific plans.  But what I will say is that we\u2019ve learned from the experience of Pfizer, both from the data on patients who are already experienced on Methotrexate that was presented at the FDA Advisory Committee as well as the information that came out just this week on their positive results with both 5 mg and 10 mg [VID] doses in Methotrexate naives where top line results say that they did see a structure benefit there.  And there are other lessons that we learned from Pfizer\u2019s experience as well.  So yes, there\u2019ll be structure studies and we\u2019ll be able to talk more specifically about it when Lily announces what they\u2019re doing.","Tom Russo \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of Lisa Bayko with JMP Securities.  Please proceed with your question.","Lisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities ","Hi there, good morning.  Can you just remind us what the Q1 sold in net was?  I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019m tracking with all the numbers for at least Q1.","Dave Hastings","It was $22.1 million or something like that.","Paul Friedman","And that would be analogous to $32.7 million for this quarter.  If you were doing sell in net it\u2019s $32.7 million, and since we\u2019ve had no product returns whatsoever that seems like a pretty legitimate number.","Dave Hastings","It was $22.7 million, in that range.","Lisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities ","$22.7 million, and now we\u2019re at about $32.7 million for the quarter?","Paul Friedman","Exactly.","Lisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities ","Okay.  And then can you give us any update you can on sort of the rollout timing expectations for Europe?  We know obviously it\u2019s approved but then it comes down to all the pricing negotiations and whatnot \u2013 just a sense of timing on when we can see some royalties flowing through that?","Rich Levy","So we said that we expect the approval to come sometime this summer, and I just couldn\u2019t be real specific about country-by-country pricing and reimbursement.  We do know that Novartis had some sort of call earlier this week and talked about their expanded access program where they have 2200 patients on drug now and when there was pricing in each of those countries those patients had all come over very quickly, almost a bolus there which we don\u2019t have because we didn\u2019t have expanded access per se.  So but I think that you can probably look at histories in each individual country as to how long those things usually take to get a ballpark.","Lisa Bayko \u2013 JMP Securities ","Okay, fair enough.  Thanks.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of Eric Schmidt with Cowen & Company.  Please proceed with your question.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Good morning, thanks for taking my question.  Dave, I hate to beat the dead horse here on the guidance but I just want to make sure I understand the mid-teens quote from you.  So if I understand the math right you\u2019re looking at net bookings of about $49 million in the first half of the year and comparing that to maybe $60 million-ish which is implied at the low end of your $120 million guidance for the year; and that the difference between those two is roughly high teens?  Is that where you\u2019re coming from?","Dave Hastings","Yeah, that\u2019s one way of looking at it or you can look at gross shipments as well, Eric, where we did $60 million.  If you want to do like-for-like we did $60 million and you would need high teens growth to get to net low end of our guidance.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay.  Thanks for the clarification.  And then maybe a question for Pat: one thing that I am still struggling with is on patient numbers.  If we kind of make some assumptions looking at your revenue growth Q4 to Q1 to Q2 of this year and kind of make some assumptions for when patients were added, it looks like you had a dramatic number of new patient adds in Q1; and probably exit Q1 it\u2019s something like 1300 patients to 1500 patients on the drug; and then saw very few if any net new patient adds if any in Q2.  Clearly you indicated you had at least 600 new patients being added in the quarter so where am I off here?  Can you provide us with total patients on this drug?  Any reason you\u2019re not?","Patricia Andrews","Well, we\u2019ve always tried to go back to what are the market dynamics with Myelofibrosis and the fact that the patients are dispersed in the community and most docs only have a small number.  We\u2019ve always thought the raw basis [decision for prescribing] was always the most critical metric.  Because there\u2019s not been a drug out there for Myelofibrosis before, estimating things like discontinuations, compliance, duration of therapy \u2013 that\u2019s hard to do with the patients.  You can look to the study data and make some estimates and conclusions but you don\u2019t know how that will be in the real world.  ","But you do know that a new prescriber is a very valuable thing to have because that means that is a physician who probably has a handful of MF patients now getting experience with the drug.  So that\u2019s why that is the metric we continue to highlight, because we think that is a kind of unequivocal metric \u2013 we know what that means.  That is a net positive that that number continues to grow; versus it is a little bit harder to read patient numbers and say \u201cWhat do they mean?\u201d  It depends on how long the patients stay on drug.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay.  I mean I guess I understand that point but can you also help me understand where my math has gone wrong?  Or did the new patients total on this drug grow very little from the end of Q1 to the end of Q2?","Patricia Andrews","No, there were definitely new patient adds in Q2.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Net patients on drug?","Patricia Andrews","The net patients on drug increased in Q2.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Substantially?","Patricia Andrews","That depends on your definition of \u201csubstantially.\u201d  It increased very much the way we\u2019ve sort of outlined we expected this to unfurl, in a gradual but steady increase.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Okay.  Is there a point in time when you might allow IMS to collect data on prescriptions just to provide another source of information to us?","Patricia Andrews","Our challenge is that if we let the third parties collect data on prescriptions it also goes to potential competitors to give them a leg up even though they are a number of years behind us that we don\u2019t have to actually give them.  And so it is important competitive intelligence and I would like to guard that for as long as I am able to.","Eric Schmidt \u2013 Cowen & Company","Thanks for the answers.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of [Ying Wa] of Barclays Capital.  Please state your question.","Christina \u2013 Barclays Capital","Hi guys, this is Christina on behalf of [Ying Wa].  So I just had a quick question around what types of average duration of Jakafi therapy you\u2019re seeing so far; and also to the extent that you can separate for us the proportion of intermediate and high-risk patients on Jakafi therapy.","Paul Friedman","Pat?","Patricia Andrews","Sure.  So we think it\u2019s too early to comment on duration of therapy so we haven\u2019t provided that information.  It\u2019s just I\u2019m not sure that it would tell you something that you\u2019d actually be able to successfully build a model off of, which is why we\u2019ve gone the opposite way and tried to focus in on prescribers and referred you back to things such as the studies which provide you longer-term information.  So we\u2019re somewhat more forward-looking.","And on the percent, what we know from our tracking studies is that about 90% of patients on the drug from the physicians that we\u2019ve surveyed are intermediate II and high-risk, which is maybe 50% of the total in that patient population.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from David Friedman of Morgan Stanley.  Please state your question.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Hi, thanks for taking the question.  Is the $9 million that you guys have shipped but booked as deferred revenue this year so far, is that a reasonably proxy for the dollar amount of channel fill to just build up the run rate of inventory?  Or I guess a different way is of the revenue guidance that you\u2019ve given, what amount of that in dollars is inventory buildup to get the channels full?","Dave Hastings","Yeah, $9 million is a good proxy for the inventory held at specialty pharmacies, David.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, and that\u2019s a reasonable run rate given the demand that you guys are forecasting for the year?","Dave Hastings","Yes.","David Friedman \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from the line of Boris Peaker with Oppenheimer.  Please state your question.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer ","Yes, hello.  I would just like to understand the dosing within the first two to three months of new patient, particularly in the community settings.  I mean specifically how often do you see docs prescribe maybe two different pill doses, either twice the number of 5 mgs or 5 mgs and 10 mgs to the same patient in order to enable them to adjust the dose themselves?  And how is that different between the community setting versus more of an academic setting?","Paul Friedman","Pat?","Patricia Andrews","Sure.  So most scripts are written for one bottle, a 30-day supply \u2013 that is the vast majority.  But you\u2019re right; there are certainly some scripts that are for lower doses, say two bottles of 5 mg for what\u2019s intended to be a 10 mg dose and allows flexibility on the part of the prescribing physician.  So just a couple of points on that: we have seen that those are generally covered without too much delay by payers so we consider that a very positive thing.  It is coming more from academic physicians, physicians who have more experience with more patients I would say.  More of the community physicians are actually starting on a fixed dose such as 15 mg or 20 mg and prescribing it in that strength rather than in subsets so they can titrate around it.  But the majority are the script equals one bottle.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer ","And can you give maybe a more quantitative answer for the patients that do get let\u2019s say two bottles: how long do they typically get the two bottles for?  My guess is at some point insurance companies might object to that. And quantitatively how much of an impact does that have on your revenue in terms of having twice the revenue from one patient?","Patricia Andrews","So again, it\u2019s really quite a small percentage of the total.  It\u2019s probably single-digit but to be honest I don\u2019t have that data in front of me, but it\u2019s probably a single-digit number.  And at the moment as I said it\u2019s not something where there have been many payer issues, but of course the sooner you do something which is a little bit different from what the norm would be there may be an added delay on it.  But we see in general very few payer issues, certainly none worth being overly concerned about.","Boris Peaker \u2013 Oppenheimer ","Okay.  Thank you very much for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from David Crump with Morningstar.  Please state your question.","David Crump \u2013 Morningstar","Hi, thanks for taking the call.  My question is on that 75% of physicians that you believe are waiting for the perfect candidate.  How confident are you that they\u2019re going to get one of those severe patients?  It just seems like if there\u2019s maybe 3000 to 4000 severe patients out there there\u2019s a good chance, maybe even half the physicians will never get that perfect severe patient or at least not for many years.  So is there any plan to kind of get them more comfortable with the drug and start using it on more intermediate or less severe candidates before they get that perfect candidate?","Patricia Andrews","Yes, absolutely.  I mean education and particularly understanding a couple of aspects of the disease is really important because remember, most of these physicians may have 1500 patients in their practice and three or four of them are MF patients.  So they\u2019re just not as familiar overall with the disease or with the drug.  But one thing that is clear is that many patients advance relatively rapidly; you saw that in our clinical trial.  Data even at six months, if you look at what happened to the patients on placebo in COMFORT 1, their spleens grew \u2013 the vast majority progressed and progressed fairly rapidly, and sometimes to a fairly large extent.","So MF patients, most will become severe at some point in time.  Now of course we think for the benefit of patients it would be better to capture them earlier on in the disease so you don\u2019t let the spleen get so large, so you don\u2019t let the patient have this diminished quality of life, this heavy burden of disease.  So it is important to start earlier and our label clearly allows that.  ","There are no restrictions on timing or starting, and so working on education about the progression of the disease and the role of our therapy in it is definitely an important thing and we will be focusing in on that more over the coming year than we have the past seven months where our focus was more directed on the already-diagnosed, more severely ill patient \u2013 put them on drug.  They\u2019ve waited long enough; give them something that\u2019s going to help them.","David Crump \u2013 Morningstar","Okay, thanks.","Operator","Our next question is from Mani Mohindru with ThinkEquity.  Please state your question.","Mani Mohindru \u2013 ThinkEquity","Hi, thanks for taking my question.  Most of my questions have been answered but I just wanted to get a qualitative sense on discontinuations.  What has your feedback been from the field and what\u2019s driving the discontinuations if at all?  Is it the lack of expected efficacy or symptom relief that the patient or the physician wanted to see?  Or is there emergence of side effects like thrombocytopenia or other [side opinions] that\u2019s driving that?  And then I have one more follow-up question on the pipeline.","Patricia Andrews","So I would say the discontinuations, again, it\u2019s hard to be more granular but anecdotally from our feedback from physicians there have been certainly some patients who were very severely ill who went on drug and their discontinuations are because they were just so advanced.  But there\u2019s also some discontinuations for anemia or from bicitopenia.  ","There has to be more education out there on how you might manage expected side effects of the drug, and how when patients are on drug over a long period of time their hemoglobin comes back to somewhat below baseline but to a very reasonable level; and how patients, even though they may experience bad actually tend to still have a significant improvement in their spleen and their symptoms.  In support of it is education on working through the discontinuations by adjusting the dose before the patient discontinues rather than having them discontinue.","So we are seeing, there\u2019s certainly dose holds out there and it would be hard to know if something is a dose hold or a discontinuation until time passes.  But a lot of it is just what we would expect on side effect management and comfort with that, and that goes back to the education.","Mani Mohindru \u2013 ThinkEquity","Okay, so the way I\u2019m looking at it right now is there\u2019s a potential for these patients to come back on therapy unless they go onto some other clinical trials once these side effects get resolved or managed in some way.","Patricia Andrews","I do think that patients, their platelets recover; their hemoglobin if it was depressed would recover.  It\u2019s certainly a potential when the patient has that recovery to go back on drug.  Our label really states how you restart dosing.  Remember, thrombocytopenia would be an expected side effect based on mechanism.  The part of it that is making sure that it\u2019s well understood, how you work through that, how you keep the patient on drug \u2013 that\u2019s clearly the most beneficial thing for us if the patient is to never stop their treatment rather than discontinue, wait to recover and then go back on.  And when they do restart what\u2019s the appropriate restarting dose?  ","So all of those things are about familiarity with the drug and for a physician who has one patient on drug that\u2019s a longer education than it would be for a physician on their fifth patient, on their sixth patient.  So over time I do think that will also be something that familiarity and knowledge helps us work through, but right at the moment it\u2019s all part of what would be expected at this stage of launch.","Mani Mohindru \u2013 ThinkEquity","Okay, that\u2019s helpful.  And one quick question on the c-MET and the IDO: will we see any Phase I data from that before it\u2019s completely handed over to your partner?","Rich Levy","So that\u2019s going to be up to Novartis at this point.  Even though we did the Phase I study for them it really is their decision about what data will get presented and when.","Mani Mohindru \u2013 ThinkEquity","Okay.  And the initiation of the Phase III RA program, will that be more likely a Q4 event right now rather than Q3?  Is that how we should look at it?  And I\u2019m trying to get at it from more of a financial perspective to you, from a milestone perspective.","Rich Levy","So I mean let me just say that I don\u2019t think Lily would be comfortable with us being that specific.  But we don\u2019t think that there\u2019s much risk at all that it wouldn\u2019t happen this year, which indicates that it\u2019s not close to the end of the year where things are targeted for.","Mani Mohindru \u2013 ThinkEquity","Okay, that\u2019s very helpful.  Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.  Our next question is from Ian Somaiya of Piper Jaffray.  Please state your question.","Ian Somaiya \u2013 Piper Jaffray","My questions were answered so I\u2019ll take myself off the queue.","Operator","Thank you.  Our final question is from Thomas Wei of Jefferies & Co.  Please state your question.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Thanks for taking the follow-up.  Just two things: one, just to clarify from Rachel\u2019s question.  So when you talk about a consistent rate of week-over-week adds you meant throughout Q2 and going so far into Q3?  And then what can you say around quantify round compliance rates with Jakafi so far?","Paul Friedman","Pat, do you want to take that?","Patricia Andrews","Sure.  So my comment on new patient adds I was referring to Q2 over Q1.  We\u2019re not commenting on anything after the quarter at the moment, which of course would be understood since this is a Q2 call.  And on the next question, it was on... oh, compliance.  It\u2019s still, it would be early to talk about compliance.  Compliance almost by definition is a longer-term number.  You look back over a year and you say how often did patients take the drug versus how often they were supposed to take the drug.  And so it\u2019s just too early to comment on a compliance rate.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","I know before you\u2019ve said that reasonably well-tolerated oral chemotherapy drugs, the compliance that we\u2019d be looking at is in the 70% to 75% rate long-term.  Is it fair to say that just given the fact that doctors are still getting used to this and used to the side effect profile that dose holds and the like, that you may be running at less than that and hoping to kind of get up to those rates over time?","Patricia Andrews","No.  I think what I was trying to convey with the 70% to 75% is that that is a good compliance rate for a chronic oral cancer therapy, and I wasn\u2019t necessarily trying to tie it to Jakafi.  It was more again, what things do you look at to help give some sense.  I can\u2019t give compliance numbers because there hasn\u2019t been enough time since launch, but out there in general compliance of 70%, 75% is pretty good for a chronic oral oncology product.  ","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","And that consistent rate comment of it being Q2 over Q1, I guess I don\u2019t understand that.  I thought you talked about there being a bolus in Q1 so how could the number of patients added in Q2 be the same as Q1?","Patricia Andrews","I think what I was saying is there was consistent new patient adds in Q2.","Thomas Wei \u2013 Jefferies & Co.","Okay, thank you.  I\u2019ll follow up offline.","Operator","Thank you.  There are no further questions at this time.  I would now like to turn the floor back to management for closing comments.","Paul Friedman","This is Paul.  We\u2019ve run past 9:30, it\u2019s been a long call.  So I\u2019ll just summarize by saying launch is going well.  It is almost to the letter on what we forecasted before we launched the drug, and there\u2019s lumpiness if you look at it on a daily or weekly basis but if you look at it on a quarterly basis we think we\u2019re growing.  Launch is going well and we\u2019ve said all along that we thought there would be steady and gradual growth and that\u2019s what we\u2019re seeing.  Just to reiterate about Q1, it was mildly higher than what we forecasted \u2013 not a classical bolus but there were some very sick people queued up.  And we\u2019ll obviously keep plugging away and we\u2019ll anticipate that we will continue to grow.  And so far there\u2019s no indication that we\u2019re [not] growing at exactly the rate that we forecasted before we started this.","We\u2019re very excited about baricitinib going into Phase III.  We think it has a very high probability of technical success and we think that the compounds that we have earlier in the clinic, including 39-110 are very interesting and we look forward to providing you with more information on those at the appropriate time.  So with that I will end the call and thank you very much for your attention.  Bye-bye.","Operator","This concludes today\u2019s teleconference.  You may disconnect your lines at this time.
