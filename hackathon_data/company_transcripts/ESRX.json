Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect.","I would now like to turn the call over to your host for today, Mr. Ben Bier, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Benjamin Bier - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Good morning. With me today is Tim Wentworth, CEO and President.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in the company's most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update or otherwise release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements.","For clarity purposes, all financial numbers except where indicated that we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis and are attributable to Express Scripts excluding non-controlling interest representing the share allocated to members of our consolidated affiliates.","Furthermore, we are providing underlying performance of the company's core business, excluding the contributions from Coventry and Catamaran, both of which were acquired and are rolling off the company's book of business, as well as Anthem, to which we refer together as the transitioning clients.","This presentation will be posted on our website and includes an appendix with footnotes and the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. I want to start by saying that we are very pleased to have Jim Havel coming back to Express Scripts to join my leadership team as our Chief Financial Officer. Jim's understanding of our business, both financially and operationally, will enable a seamless transition in the execution of our strategic initiatives.","In addition, I want thank Eric Slusser for his over two years of experience and service to us. He has been a strong steward of our shareholders' financial resources and built a strong finance team that is critical to our long-term success.","Now to highlight our third quarter, we reported 9% adjusted earnings per share growth. We grew cash flow by 28%, and announced our pending acquisition of eviCore healthcare.","I also want to say that last week's announcement by Anthem, while disappointing and perplexing, was not surprising to us and reaffirms the actions that we have already begun to take to focus on our strong core and transform our business as we look into the next decade. We have a terrific team who services Anthem and will continue to do so through the transition.","From the work that we do to lower costs and improve care to the novel solutions we create with and for our clients, to the investments were are making in our business to drive long-term growth, we are rapidly evolving to stay ahead of healthcare trends. In the midst of so much change, our focus on patients has never been more resolute.","By the way, while today is about financial results, it is also a moment to show appreciation for our people who do extraordinary work every day to ensure patients get the medicine they need. In challenging times, that work has never been more important, and since August, we have seen what it means to be a hero for those in need as demonstrated by many of our 26,000 employees who have put themselves in harm's way to deliver to those we serve.","Natural disasters have devastated areas across our country, but we have rallied to meet our commitment to every patient. I thank all of our employees and all the first responders and others helping communities recover for their tremendous efforts. Millions of people are still in dire situations, and we are here to serve for the long haul.","The constellation on this slide broadly illustrates the complex work that we do every day for 3,000 clients and more than 80 million people. For our clients, we consult with them on how to get the most value from the pharmacy benefit they provide their members or employees. That means developing and implementing formularies, creating and managing pharmacy networks aimed at achieving cost and clinical outcomes, providing best-in-class care to members and providing access to specialist pharmacists who deeply understand patient needs.","Additionally, for our health plan clients, that means standing shoulder-to-shoulder with them to help them grow their businesses. With our size, focused scale, deep expertise and independent model of client alignment, we are uniquely positioned to take bold actions, deliver specialized care and create innovative solutions that our country needs to maintain affordable access to medicine. Cost and care are not mutually exclusive. We enable payers to achieve both.","Whether you've invested in Express Scripts for a few months or a few decades, it is critical to understand two things: the comprehensive set of unique capabilities we have assembled and built, and the benefits payers and patients realize when we deploy our scale and expertise on their behalf. I want to spend a moment talking about those specific benefits.","As you can see, we deliver savings to our clients in a number of ways. With our national preferred formulary covering over 25 million lives, we are able to leverage competition to drive greater value with over $7 billion in value created over the last five years.","Our clinically based utilization management programs help people make better decisions and eliminate wasteful spending. Creating 90-day options through home delivery and retail pharmacies, we optimize choices for patients while delivering the best care and savings. Most importantly, our specialized patient care improves adherence and health outcomes, while our data analytics prevent or close gaps in care that we identify through the integration of our members' medical and pharmacy data.","When you look at delivering the bottom-line numbers, you can see that without us, payers would have an additional 30% or more added to their annual pharmacy bill, and that's just the financial cost. Through our specialized model of patient care, people stay on their therapy and get to better health. That is the power of Express Scripts.","And clients recognize our leadership. We already have 18 million covered lives in our Multiple Sclerosis Care Value Program, our most recently launched program within our SafeGuardRx set of solutions. Health plan clients increasingly count on us, using our expertise to establish formularies, negotiate their rebates, and strategically evolve their pharmacy and integrated offerings.","In the same way, health plans are focusing their specialty networks, increasingly choosing to rely exclusively on the outstanding patient care we provide at Accredo.","Bottom line, as an independent PBM, we are 100% focused on executing our strategy to drive down costs, improve care and continually innovate. We have the freedom to pursue new ways to create competition and value, and have demonstrated we can partner with others to drive significant results for members, clients and shareholders.","While I will not address recent speculation and rumors concerning potential disruption in our space, I will simply say that we are confident in our model, always interested in new ways to create value, and have built a company that surrounds patients with specialized care in a way that nobody else does. The value we create for clients and patients goes far beyond simply dispensing medications.","We are updating our full-year retention rate to be between 95% and 96%. As we said last quarter, we have had an exceptional year with renewals in our health plan, federal and commercial businesses, which continued through the third quarter. In addition, while we did not secure new cornerstone case in a year, which only saw a few come to market, overall sales results have been encouraging. For example, we have achieved a 60% increase in middle-market sales over our strong 2016 performance.","We are very optimistic about how we are positioned for the next two selling seasons where we know there is significant opportunity to win new business. We have also seen very strong response to our solutions in the third quarter. Introducing our new comprehensive opioid approach along with our updated SafeGuardRx offering, has led to increased sales this year, but will also provide a strong base to growth from next year as these programs create better outcomes for members and deliver savings to clients.","We are also excited about our strong partnerships with over 75 regional health plans. They recognize the value we bring and increasingly are engaged with us to collaborate more comprehensively. For example, we are delivering strong star ratings to the regulated business. Additionally, we are mapping out joint sales strategies and are collaborating to increase care to patients through a comprehensive approach, which keeps healthcare cost in check.","We have been and continue to be the trusted PBM partner of choice for health plans as we integrate with them to drive their care management and member experience initiatives. Looking forward, the opportunity to expand our role with health plans is meaningfully enhanced through our recently announced agreement with eviCore, a leading medical benefit management company.","As I mentioned at the outset this morning, we are accelerating our evolution of the company. Looking forward to the future, more clients, health plans in particular, are looking for a comprehensive approach to benefits management. By taking our size, strength and expertise in the pharmacy side of the benefit and adding eviCore's outstanding offerings on the medical side, we will be the nation's leading patients benefit management company, a new kind of PBM, if you will.","eviCore has access to over 100 million patients. While there is some overlap with the 80 million members we serve, we know that together we have the opportunity to improve care and drive out wasteful spend for a third of our country's population. It is an outstanding opportunity for us to better get at the $1 trillion, our country waste annually on non-adherence to medicine and overutilization of healthcare.","As in pharmacy management when we drive out waste and improve cost and care, we are rewarded. eviCore has far-reaching capabilities across many therapeutic areas, today managing areas that have more than $300 billion in annual spend and many opportunities for us together to drive further growth.","We are optimistic we will close on this acquisition by the end of the year setting the stage to add an important driver of future growth. We are impressed with the eviCore management team and plan to have the company operate as a stand-alone business leveraging the great relationships they have built over the past 25 years. Those relationships have in turn led to a thriving business, which we expect to grow by double digits over the next few years. Upon closing, eviCore will be accretive to earnings in its first full year of operation and we will provide more specific objections beyond 2017 on our 2018 guidance call later this year, assuming we close the transaction.","I want to make a few points very clear. Our work is comprehensive. We are well-positioned for future growth and we are not standing still. We are providing benefits to payers and patients that they do not get from other PBMs. We are partnering with health plans in new and innovative ways. We are broadening our capabilities into new areas of healthcare for us, which will allow us to do more to improve affordability and access, while also delivering growth.","And finally, as we evolve what we do and how we do it, Express Scripts continues to build on a strong legacy of innovation, patient care, financial discipline and performance that reward shareholders. In addition to making external investments, as you know, we have committed to internal investments to change the way we engage with our patients, providers and clients, a multiyear effort we have called our enterprise value initiative and launched last quarter.","Over the last 12 weeks, we have been hard at work mapping and sizing opportunities and examining our end-to-end processes. We are beginning to reimagine and redesign our patients and physician experience. Also, we have a line of sight to automating routine processes and making it far easier for our clients to do business with us.","In the coming weeks, we'll finalize a plan that is fully integrated across our organization and continue to expect value of approximately $600 million annually by 2021. This investment, along with the pending acquisition of eviCore, debt reduction of $650 million and share repurchases of $2.8 billion year-to-date are all being executed in a very disciplined fashion. We are committed to being very thoughtful about how we deploy our shareholders' capital.","Turning to financials, we reported third quarter adjusted earnings-per-share of $1.90, which represents an increase of 9% over last year and is consistent with the midpoint of our guidance range. Our adjusted claims for the quarter were $343.6 million, slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. This shortfall is primarily attributable to the exchange volumes being down year-over-year, as well as the natural disasters devastating regions across our country impacting both retail and mail client.","Adjusted SG&A decreased 5% over last year. Within the context of our enterprise value initiative plan, we slowed some spending in the third quarter allowing our teams to analyze projects across the organization to ensure they're fully aligned and coordinated to officially meet our organizations' 2021 goal. We generated $1.9 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Our core adjusted EBITDA grew 1% to $1.3 billion resulting in core adjusted EBITDA per adjusted claim of $4.68, up 2%. Our year-to-date core adjusted EBITDA increase is up 2.5% over the prior period, driven by generic acquisition cost at mail, Accredo growth, increased rebate value and new solution sales. From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1.9 billion of net cash flow from operations, up 28% over last year.","We also repurchased 11.5 million shares for $712.8 million during the quarter and completed our second 10b5-1 plan on October 9, 2017. Year-to-date, we have repurchased 43.3 million shares for $2.8 billion.","With that, I will now turn to 2017 updated guidance. We continue to expect 2017 adjusted claims to come in at a midpoint of 1.4 billion, generating an expected adjusted EBITDA of $7.4 billion at the midpoint of our range, 2% over 2016 adjusted EBITDA. We are increasing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance for the year from a range of $6.95 to $7.05 to a new range of $6.97 to $7.05. This represents growth of 9% to 10% over the prior year. We now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of $580 million to $585 million.","In the fourth quarter of 2017, our diluted share range balances additional share repurchases with closing on the eviCore acquisition. With respect to the fourth quarter of 2017, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $2.03 to $2.11, up 8% to 12% year-over-year.","I have covered a lot of material this morning, so to sum up our quarter and year-to-date, we delivered $1.90 in adjusted earnings per diluted share in the third quarter, an increase of 9% over the third quarter of 2016. Year-to-date core adjusted EBITDA growth is 2.5%. We had another strong year of sales with retention above 95%, a 60% increase versus 2016 of new named accounts in our employer segment and a record year for new solution sales within our existing client base. We are executing on our growth strategy by investing in ourselves and through acquisitions to change the way we engage with members, clients and providers as well as to expand our set capabilities to drive waste out of healthcare both in the medical and pharmacy spend.","We look forward to speaking with you again when we have our 2018 guidance call before the market opens on Thursday, December 14.","At this point, I will be happy to answer any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. The first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much. Thanks, Tim, for all the comments. First, let me start with the selling season for 2018. You talked about a 60% increase in the wins in the middle market, but can you maybe talk about what your expectations are for plan design because I think that's what will drive EBITDA as we think about 2018. Did you see more people taking up your formulary? Did you see more people coming into your SafeGuard program? That would be my first question, just how do I think about what people are signing up for in 2018?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I'll start, and I have Dave Queller here who can add any additional color. The short answer is, particularly in the middle market and in employer space, but even more broadly, our national preferred formulary, our tightly managed narrowed specialty solution, and the majority of our, or many of our SafeGuard programs, almost every one of these new clients has adopted. Dave, I think that's probably the quick and safe answer here.","David A. Queller - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, that's the great part about the middle market, Lisa, is that they're looking for comprehensive solutions to help manage their spend. They're managing the longevity of their plans, and by doing that, they're actually engaging us on all the SafeGuard programs, typically 90-day programs as well, whether it be mandatory home delivery or a 90-day retail program. And they're really looking for cost management over the long term, and I think we're well positioned to offer that to them as we think about the marketplace now and in the future of how to help them save money and have a sustainable benefit program.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And so when thinking about these programs, and Dave being in that sales position, can you maybe just talk a little bit about who you won the business from? And are they buying into all of these programs right from the beginning as we think about 2018? Or are these things that are going to build out over the next couple of years? I'm just trying to think about the business that you're winning versus the business that you lost this year for 2018?","David A. Queller - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So yes, Lisa, I would tell you that it is a broad group of folks that we're winning the business from across the markets. We're obviously focused on penetrating in areas where we may not have health plan partners, those areas that we think we can win and bring a new solution to the marketplace. In certain states, as an example, we don't have health plan partners. So we've done that.","The other piece is, is that most of these will be buying programs either initially in the initial sale or as we implement them into Express Scripts. And then there will be obviously some that will buy over time, but I would say more of the middle market buy in the front end of the selling season.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","What you find, Lisa, is with the particularly the middle market, they don't have gigantic HR departments that want to sort of engage in a lot of ad-hoc decision making. They really look to us to be a turnkey manager of their spend and so they tend to default into most of our programs right out of the chute, as Dave said, either at the sale process or as we do installations where it's just so easy for us to show them the incremental value we can bring.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then my second question, Tim, I noticed you made the comment of I'm not going to talk about disruption in the space or a disruptor in the space. But historically, I have heard you talk about Amazon and potential ways to serve the uninsured population. I think there's always this concern of that can Amazon be a disruptor to the PBM industry, and if you were to do something, are you in essence letting the fox in the henhouse by giving them access to your great mail order operations? Can you maybe just talk about how you view the market, on where you would potentially see this opportunity for those that are uninsured? And correct me if my numbers are wrong, but I think you've talked about roughly 30 million prescriptions in the U.S. today are filled by people that are uninsured.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So, it's actually 30 million people who we view as sort of the cash market that we've historically not participated in very aggressively. It's probably five times that in terms of prescriptions. And so the opportunity, first of all, is to help those folks get access to care that they can afford.","I remember before going on CBS' show, literally showing someone in the green room how the price of a very heavily used drug in the cash-paying population had dropped by 40% overnight based on our launch of Inside Rx. And I mean, it was really a striking sort of number, and that's what we've seen as we look at this population, as they have not had someone like us in their corner.","So we love the idea of being able to add that population to those we serve. That being said, certainly if you look at the, quote, fox in the henhouse, first of all let me say, people have always worried about foxes and henhouses, and what I'd say is I think our henhouse is pretty good. And I remember back in the mid 2000s, you probably do as well, there was a real thought that when Walmart launched a $4 generic list that it was the end of the PBM model as we know it. And of course what it was instead was another opportunity for PBMs to create competition and drive down costs and drive generic expansion for their clients.","Similarly, right now as I look at the possibility of disruptors such as, you mentioned Amazon in the cash space, I think there absolutely is a population there that deserves good service. We think we're doing a great job through our Inside Rx initiative, but we certainly see that as something where if they wanted to move into a space, we could be a very natural collaborator.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. I'll stop there and jump back into the queue. Thank you.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. You may ask your question.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Tim, I think you mentioned, in terms of eviCore, some overlap between your 80 million members and their 100 million. Can you just be a little bit more specific, what sort of incremental step up in lives do you think, assuming this deal closes?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","When we do close it, we'll give you a lot more color. What I would say is this, that the overlap is probably, I can tell you at the client level, that it's probably, it sits roughly 50\/50 in terms of who their clients are versus who our clients are. It may even be tilted a bit more because they have a couple very large health plans that we don't work with. So we see it as a material expansion of our ability to serve patients.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And then a follow up, now that you've got more clarity on how the selling season has ended up, what are your updated thoughts on the ability to have claims growth in 2018 and any update there?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes and of course, now on December 14 we'll give you the best sense of that. I think I'm going to reiterate what I said last quarter, which is as it relates to claims growth for 2018, given that we're very pleased that we're going to come in north of 95% retention. Obviously we would love to have come in at the higher end of our initial range. I think based on coming in at 95%, we're likely to be flat to slightly down next year. That's probably at this point the best that I can give you.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you and then one last one. What sort of inflation are you observing currently in the sort of traditional brand and specialty landscape and is that kind of tracking with your expectations? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, thanks for that question. In the sort of traditional specialty, we're seeing somewhere around 7% if you look at the full year what we're thinking about right now. Obviously, there's still time for price increases that we have not anticipated to materialize, but right now \u2013 and that's largely in line with what our expectations were when we built our original plan. That's why you haven't seen us change our guidance range at all.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Tim, you mentioned earlier that you think you're well-positioned for the selling season of next year in 2018 and 2019, but obviously we had some unexpected losses this year in the state business. Can you let us know what you might've learned and then any sort of kind of postmortem and what kind of changes have been made to give you confidence about the upcoming selling season.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, Charles, thanks for that question. The first thing I'd say is we definitely tear these things apart. If we're able to FOIA them, we do. We have folks even outside our company that help us analyze and understand sort of what we might've done to compete more effectively. I won't give you the playbook in terms of what we'll be doing going forward other than to say that, there was no one big thing that we point to that said, oh man, we just totally missed it here.","Each one of them had a story, in a couple of cases I think that we probably were a little more conservative than in hindsight we should have been. But just suffice it to say, we've looked at them, we've learned from them, we've made some leadership changes and some other things which I think position us very well for the future and it's a market we continue to serve very well, I would point that out, and so I think moving forward we expect to compete very well in that space.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Thanks. And as a follow up, you earlier just said you expect claims to be maybe flat to down based on the 95% retention rate. Can you maybe give us directionally a sense what that means for top line and obviously should we be thinking more flat to down top line, but better margins because it's more middle-market business?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I'd love to answer the question, but I'm going to wait till December 14 and give you a full picture.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","All right. I'll leave it there. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks. You mentioned some of the overlap with eviCore, but can you describe some of the cross-selling opportunities associated with that transaction and is that more over time or is there some low hanging fruit there? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I'll start and I have Dr. Glen Stettin here who heads up innovation for me and has been part of the team that as we evaluate and got to know eviCore. But certainly I can tell you, by the way the number of CEOs of our clients that I heard from after the transaction was announced was really exciting to me. The value that they place in eviCore, the belief that they believe that we with eviCore in our family of companies can take them to the next level and at the same time enhance their offerings is really powerful.","Obviously, there's a lot that we do with machine learning and integrated data that we believe can add to what they do operationally, first of all, to be even easier to do business with for the physicians they work with and the clients they serve. But as we look as well, again, clients are looking for a turnkey solution and we do have clients who today may not be managing those spaces or may not happy with the current vendors that they're using that are different than eviCore where we're able to introduce them into the relationship. Likewise, I can tell you that the leadership team at eviCore has a tremendous set of relationships.","When we did the channel checks, just a tremendous set up of relationships with their clients, some of whom again we have some relationship with but some of whom we don't and we have a real opportunity to affect introductions that way. As it relates to the sort of the products themselves and some of the cross things, I'm going to let Glen just give you a little color recognizing again the real opportunity for us when we get this closed is to put our teams together and go out and managing things that neither of us are doing today that our combined capabilities will enable. But, Glen, if you want to talk a little about that.","Glen D. Stettin - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Great, Tim. So together with the drug spend that we have under management and the medical spend that eviCore has under management, it totals more than 40% of our clients' total healthcare spending. And that creates some pretty exciting opportunities for us to better serve the health plans in their pursuit of lowering total healthcare costs for their customers. And I'd point out that some of the categories that eviCore is in, whether it's musculoskeletal, so think about it as hips and knees and back pain or oncology, cardiovascular disease, many of these categories involve pathways that have prescription drugs and other procedures, other use of medical resources.","And so together we believe that there's going to be a great ability for us to improve the value that we bring to the health plans, as well as to patients in managing their benefits more holistically through the health plan and protecting them from potential harm from unnecessary and inappropriate procedures and care and medication exposure, as well as saving significant amounts of money for the system to make medical care more affordable for both patients and the plans that pay for their care.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. That's excellent. And what sort of flexibility or clarity I guess you have now on the cost-cutting initiatives or the broader EDI initiatives now that you have more formal clarity on Anthem? How involved I guess will the new CFO be in this sort of cost structure initiatives that you're still finalizing? And do you anticipate any sort of changes to your initial plans or even other changes to management team members? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. So I am really proud of the leadership of our enterprise value initiative and our broader leadership teams that have engaged on what I described as sort of looking at our different processes across the business. They have been amazingly creative and thoughtful about sort of looking at the future of our business, looking at the things we do well that we want to do better, looking to things that we could be doing better, leveraging new technologies, leveraging different ways of doing business. And what I would say is, as I sit here today, while we don't have it completely cast, we remain very confident in the numbers that we gave you originally as it relates to the spending of $550 million to $600 million of incremental capital over three years to deliver at the end, $1.2 billion of cumulative value and a $600 million run rate in terms of reduction in costs.","So I think we have not seen anything that has caused us to feel less bullish about the value we're going to create with that investment and as well the excitement we've created an organization. With the Anthem's decision, obviously, it gives us a bit a clear line of sight to some of the work we have to do. And as I said, we have a great team working on that and I'm very confident we'll be executionally strong there. And as it relates to the role of the new CFO, it's going to be the same as the role of the old CFO, which is integral. It is no question that the CFO is a key member of my team. Eric was, Jim will be, and the enterprise value initiative is not a siloed event. It is something that my entire team is committed to and that the CFO will help to drive.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","The next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question","Jason Jakoby - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey. This is Jason Jakoby in for Bob. Circling back to Amazon for a second, so I know in the past you said a bunch of times that you're open at working with them, partnering with them, maybe collaborating with them, but just so we think of like what role Amazon might play here, how do you weigh the risk that Amazon might pose to your mail business \u2013 your mail pharmacy, especially given how profitable that is for you guys?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I appreciate the question. I mean, first of all, the most important thing to understand is what we do for our paying clients who contract with us to take care of their members is deliver great care across channels including mail. As it relates to those patients that are at mail, we have been investing for 30 years to create an unparalleled capability to serve those members and we continue to improve it both in terms of the cost of delivery and the service that's being provided. In many cases, we've knocked a day and a half off the turnaround time in the last 12 months by virtue of how we've contracted with the other parts of the supply chain and so forth, and we've done that while lowering the costs by tens of millions of dollars. And so from my perspective, I feel very confident in our ability to deliver best-in-class both cost and service mail.","That being said, the only members that can achieve that today are members that are inside of our paying clients, and so as I think about the role that Amazon could play either whether that be, as I spoke earlier, as it relates to cash payers who we believe \u2013 I believe we can jointly serve through many relationships, not just Amazon, let me say that, but also as I think about sort of them deciding to move into a retailer sort of a mail view to the extent they can do that in a competitive way that meets the clinical and service sort of standards that the market continues to evolve, we'd love to create that competition by introducing them into the mix. And so from my perspective, I see that as a net positive.","If they choose to become a PBM, then we'd have a competitor on our hands and we'd have to deal with it, but again, our independent focused model and the value we have shown clients, I feel very confident will stand well against an entry in the PBM space be it Amazon or anybody.","Jason Jakoby - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. So if like, let's say, I mean not looking at the cash market but looking at, let's say, they actually maybe joined one of your networks, would that not \u2013 and you offer them as like part of your retail network, would that not potentially pose a threat to what your mail pharmacy does? Presumably Amazon would also go after a lot of chronic drugs and a lot of drugs that could also be ordered like over express mail, right?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. And listen, our mail has to be able to compete with everything today and so, as I think we've mentioned in the past, we have contracted with retailers in such a way as to put our certain retail 90 programs for us not at parity but much, much closer to parity with our mail in terms of the value that we create for clients and for ourselves. And so from that standpoint, our mail has to continue to stand on its own, it has to continue to compete or else we should reevaluate that and I believe it will and can do those things. But also the terms under which an Amazon entry, for example, would have to compete would be very stiff because I can tell you when you saw an announcement yesterday, the retailers are continuing to do everything they can to get volume and that produces a great opportunity for us to create that competition and drive value for our clients and keep a small piece of that for ourselves.","Jason Jakoby - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Rose V. Lauricella - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Hi there. This is Rose Lauricella on behalf of Ricky today. Now that Anthem has made its decision not to renew the contract, is the price check for the existing contract still on the table and how should we think about potential impact of forward earnings?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So, I'm actually not going to speak to the existing contract or interpret it for you on this call. What I'd say is, we've obviously always believed we would live up to that contract. The one thing I'll say is, I would remind you that the fundamental dispute that exists here is over what they're entitled to and so I'm not going to characterize it now, but what I'll say is this, we will continue to live up to the contract, we're disappointed obviously it's a decision that they've made, and frankly as I said perplexed, but I'm just going to leave it at that at this point.","Rose V. Lauricella - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Just a quick follow up there, I mean last year it was disclosed that Express offered Anthem $250 million in annual re-pricing. Is that a figure we should think about as we evaluate the different scenarios?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Actually, the number we talked about was quite a bit higher than that and what I would say is this; you should talk to Anthem about how they get to the number they think it's worth in 2020. Certainly if they continue to modernize their benefits as we've long told them that was an opportunity, if they get pricing that's I suspect highly competitive for 2020 \u2013 I hope they did if I were there shareholders \u2013 then there's a significant amount of savings for them in 2021 when they move it off. It's savings they could have achieved by staying with us but chose not to.","Rose V. Lauricella - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. You may ask your question. Please check your mute button.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Thank you. Yes, I just wanted to ask a quick question on the CFO transition. So I had met Jim Havel back in 2015 and he had come in as the Interim CFO at the time. And then Eric was named the CFO. Can you talk about Jim's role at the company between now and then? And then what precipitated the change if anything that you can elaborate on?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No, sure. While Jim was with us, I'd recall if you go back in history, Jim came in at a time we had been making a CFO transition. We were predisposed to bringing in a public company CFO with industry experience and so Jim came in and did an amazing job for us, earning the respect of our board, his employees and my leadership team in the process. And obviously through the process of the search that was underway, we hired Eric. But he had earned a tremendous amount of respect. After leaving, Jim has been engaged in a number of things and also has actually been a very attractive candidate to a couple of healthcare companies recently that I'm aware of.","But as we sit here today, therefore, the mutual decision that Eric and I reached where he will ultimately be pursuing other opportunities, recognizing he is still part of our management team through March as Jim comes in, and he leaves behind a very strong team in finance. Jim coming in is a known quantity, as I said, respected by everybody and I think gives us the chance to not skip a beat. He learned our business well both operationally and financially when he was here. He's a strong leader. He's a strong manager of controls in a good control environment in a business where a lot of cash comes through our hands. And so I and my team, our board, and our finance team are all very, very confident that Jim's going to do a great job.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","That's very helpful. Just lastly on the cash side, obviously you guys produce a significant amount of free cash flow. Some of that I guess will go to pay down the eviCore acquisition. Anything else on the acquisition front that would move you a little bit away or a little further away from the PBM business that you can talk about in terms of a strategy going forward?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So actually, let me reframe your question, because I want to keep moving toward the PBM business, but redefining the P as in patient. And so from that standpoint, because we really like the core PBM. We think it's a great enabler and a great chassis for some of these other things to complement. We're always looking at things in the space.","Obviously, we're very pleased when we were successful at the eviCore management team and our getting together and getting this transaction announced. They have ideas. We've had ideas. When we complete this transaction, we're going to be able to sit down together and really evaluate the payer services space more broadly and look at places that are natural for us. Not going to name any names now, but we have probably a half dozen things that we would be looking at and tracking as we look over the next 12 to 18 months.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","The next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Swann. You may ask your question.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you please talk about the cost reduction program? Exactly what sort of costs are going to be taken out? And then any comments on any updates like the formulary and your views of biosimilars would be very helpful. Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I'll start, as it relates to the cost reduction piece, obviously we're still working through the work. Some of it is going to be as simple as severance and footprint as it relates to things that are directly attributable to Anthem. And I say that, we're going to work to minimize that.","We actually think natural attrition and other things can give us a pretty good glide path given that as I tell people, this isn't a tornado dropping out of the sky. This is a hurricane that we can see coming and so we can plan for it and be thoughtful about it. But a lot of it is going to be investment in technology to reduce sort of friction in our processes both in terms of how we work with physicians and how we work with members as well as clients.","I would give you the example of prior authorizations, which today are still over half done by faxes or other primitive methods, I'll call it. And so while we've moved the needle a long way there, we think there's more we can do. That requires investments in technology and people to execute it. And there's a whole series of things that I would just point to that ultimately, we speak a little bit or give you a little bit of a hint on it with the slide that we put up where we talk about some of the measures of success.","And so again, we still have a third of our members who are calling us who frankly don't want to, and who even tried the self-serve, understanding them driving their NPS score up, making the changes in our website and our digital experiences that will lower our costs and improve our experience and give our ability to better manage the risk that our clients take as it relates to those patients' behavior. Those are the kind of things that I think are going to be very powerful.","Now as it relates to formulary and biosimilars and so forth, I will start and then I will ask Everett Neville, who is my Senior Vice President over our supply chain and strategy to speak. It's a longer-term opportunity for us, that we're preparing for and we believe we are perfectly positioned to do what this industry did for the last 20 years with sort of small molecule generics, which is dried biosimilars adoption, when they become available. And we've been advocating very strongly in Washington and we've been working at the state level to put laws in place that will facilitate the dispensing of biosimilars when they become available. And so we see it as a significant opportunity.","I would also tell you that probably as we begin evolving our investor conversations over the next 12 months, we're going to begin dimensionalizing it more because we can begin to see sort of the horizon on this, it's not necessarily a big 2018 opportunity. It is definitely a meaningful 5-year to 10-year opportunity, and Everett any color beyond that at all?","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I would just comment that we continue to see increasing leverage from a formulary position. And that leverage is spreading and growing more in the specialty space, particularly in the coming year in the MS space with the generic co-packs and product, recently being released. From a biosimilar perspective, we remain convinced, in fact more convinced than ever that they will have an impact, the timing is where the biggest question is. We now have a bookend, we know that we will see biosimilar Humira product by January 23, there's some possibility of that earlier. We've got the Inflectra product, the other products coming in that space as well. And they are already having some meaningful impact and cost in this space.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","The next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank AG","Yes. Thanks for taking my question. Tim, in your prepared remarks, you provide a lot of details around the services you provide, and I think investors would say they've heard that from other PBMs pretty similar pitches, and so my question is really twofold. When you meet with your clients you have data that suggests that your programs are more effective at controlling spend, and are you able to compare and contrast sort of your results versus the competitors? Because I think the second part of the question what we hear from investors, they seem to be very focused on the fact that Express Scripts is earning an above average return relative to the competition. So I guess the question is what really gives you the confidence that that trend is sustainable?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Let me start with the above-average return, you need to mix adjust that to start with, and I'm not going to be able to get it down to the decimal point for you, but there's a lot in there when you actually take a look at the different mix. You look at \u2013 you back out our Anthem business for example, you then take a look at the other competitors. Also our mail piece obviously has to compete against retail, but we have got our cost situation there where it's very attractive. So, I don't have clients coming to me saying we're over earning on things at all. You know at the end of the day we've got a price to compete, and our clients I can promise you, they force us to compare and contrast pretty much almost every large sophisticated client. And the retention results we had with health plans and large employers particularly and our federal businesses this year, those were all highly competitive where we had to show value.","Some of that value comes from our scale and our ability to basically drive down unit costs, but a lot of it comes from being able to take and manage risk as it relates to whether that's what we do in specialty, and drug trend. What we do in terms of generic substitution or other things, and I recognize that from a distance all the PBMs look like they have the same capabilities. But when I take a look at our ability to put \u2013 do value-based contracting, we've brought that to life for clients and we're the only guys getting their money back in the inflammatory condition space right now, for example. That's a meaningful, tangible difference, and we've got over half a dozen programs that we have launched that competitors may have imitated by name, but have not imitated substantively that our clients are absolutely seeing the benefits of.","And so, I can tell you at the highest level, I talked to the CEO of one of the largest regional Blues plans in the country yesterday who talk to me about the visit that was made to our lab when this individual spent a day and saw specifically with their data what we were able to help them do and commit to in the future, and we've secured a renewal in that case, as we have most of our health plans as I've mentioned already that were out for bid. So from that standpoint, I feel very, very comfortable that when it comes down to discerning clients, doing an objective analysis, we stand tall.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank AG","And maybe if I could just ask one follow-up question with respect to pricing, I mean when you were commenting earlier in your remarks on the CVS Anthem situation, I think you described it as perplexing. Obviously the savings that Anthem put forth were probably bigger than what people appreciated, and I certainly appreciate the uniqueness of that situation. But as you think about the potential ramifications that that could have on pricing in the industry, is that too far of a leap? Or as you think about trying to sell business in the wake of that announcement, does that have any impact at all? Or how should we think about that?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I really don't think it does. I mean I can tell you I've spoken to or communicated with the CEOs of almost all the major health plans in our book, for example, or many of them, and there's none of them that actually view it as a factor. They aren't concerned about our leverage and scale. They already know what we do working with them.","If we were going to have a scale reduction that was meaningful, then I'd think we'd have some work to do, but because of the relationship we've had with Anthem and the things they've already not done on their own or not participated in for us, whether it be formulary, retail, networks, mail, specialty, we are not left uncovered in being able to do our job really well and continue to innovate.","And in fact, it's the opposite. I think that with our enterprise value initiative, we're going to be coming to market with an even more interesting story over the next couple of years that will cause us to compete very well.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank AG","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Michael Baker with Raymond James. You may ask your question.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. Thanks. I was wondering how much you spent on the enterprise value initiative to-date. And then as you think about your spending, how you make the determination or how you're making the determination in terms of what you add back to GAAP earnings to come to adjusted?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. So year-to-date, it's been below $25 million that we spent. It was said it was about $23 million, and largely that's in the kind of things you would expect at the front end of a process like this. There's the professional fees to finalize our plan. There is some severance in the piece as well, but not a lot. So from that standpoint it has not been a lot.","Over the next three years, we think it'll probably be spending it in a fairly ratable fashion, but again, as we're just finalizing the work streams now, I don't want to declare that yet, Michael. And all these charges will be non-recurring, of course so. And the second part of your question \u2013 I'm sorry was around closing it back to GAAP?","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yes. So in other words, the $23 million came a little bit sooner than what I was expecting. It was added back. So I was just trying to get a sense of is all the enterprise value initiative going to be added back to earnings? In other words, reflected in adjusted earnings?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I'm going to let our Chief Accounting Officer and Controller, Brad Phillips, give you a more specific answer than I can. So Brad, you want to take that?","Bradley E. Phillips - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. The costs that we incurred in the third quarter, you'll continue to see that category spike out as we go, and as Tim mentioned, it began this quarter. You can expect to see it probably ramp as we go into 2018, probably not too significant in the back half, but we will track those as a project team, and you can anticipate seeing more disclosure on that in our 10-K.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. And then just back to Tim or whoever wants to answer the question, when you guys give guidance, historically you've just given adjusted EPS guidance. In light of the fact you're spending a lot of time understanding what your spend is going to be related to this, do you plan to give GAAP range as well?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Probably not at this point.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","But we'll be giving you a lot of information because we'll be breaking out our core, of course, and so forth. So our goal in doing all of this back in April was primarily to give you better view of how the core itself is performing, and that's where we're going to spend a lot of our time focused.","Benjamin Bier - Express Scripts Holding Co.","And Michael, this is Ben Bier. With the intangible asset amortization and some of the other details we break out, I think it's possible for you to do the analysis and get to an estimate of our GAAP projections.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","All right. Thanks.","Operator","The next question comes from Lance Wilkes with Sanford Bernstein. You may ask a question.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning. Just had a question on the mail and potentially online business for you folks and wanted to understand the investments you're making in the business as far as the front end of mail. How much of the business is actually conducted online today and what your strategy is for that going forward?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, I mean, mail and online, we've got a \u2013 we've had a long history of having a strong web and digital relationship with our members. We continue to invest in that, we have a roadmap actually that we just reviewed again this week at senior staff inside the company looking at the design language and how we're building that out across our platform. So we have a good \u2013 we have a great sort of strategy there. It's been an area that where the investments have very high returns for us in terms of both gross margin and cost management.","And so from our perspective, it's an important area to continue to invest in. We have NPS scores when you look at \u2013 and we're very disciplined about that. We look at NPS for new patients versus existing patients, we look at it across channels and we look for those opportunities where the investments will have the highest return both in terms of member satisfaction and costs and so from that perspective, it continues to be very important to us","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got you. And as you look at that going forward, do you see your mail and do you see your online as an offering that is going to be more compelling to customers? Especially thinking of potential disruptions in the space? I know right now you're relatively agnostic between the different channels.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","There's no question that we recognize that our consumers, our members, they compare our experience against, experiences they have across platforms outside of healthcare and there are not a lot of players in healthcare at all that are doing a great job of meeting those \u2013 that level of standard. We believe that we are meeting it today and we're going to be able to actually exceed it as we move forward. So there's no question we have to continue to make it not only compelling and attractive, but future focused.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Got you. And just one follow up on the growth comment you made earlier on pricing and some of the leadership changes you've made there. As you look forward both 2018 but beyond 2018 and 2019 and once your post Anthem, from a pricing strategy, are you going to be taking a different approach and perhaps valuing kind of membership adds a little more than margin? And then the other question around that is once the Anthem contract is no longer in place, does that eliminate any restrictions that might exist on you as far as how aggressive you get in the market or particular competitors?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So first of all, we're going to remain disciplined about membership adds. We think there are real good opportunities for membership adds that don't require us to somehow change our underlying pricing philosophy. I think the goal for us is to make sure we get a good line of sight to the value we're going to be creating because as you heard Everett say, we are now starting to look over the precipice at significant value creation that we just need to make sure we fully get credit for and bake into our underwriting. As it relates to the Anthem's contract going away, it really doesn't change at all from our perspective the ability to compete for either other large health plans or in the employer space.","Lance Arthur Wilkes - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Hey, operator, we'll take one more call.","Operator","Thank you. The last question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Rose V. Lauricella - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Question's been answered. Thank you.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Okay. Thanks, Ricky.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, again a lot of stuff that we had to go through today. I appreciate everybody dialing in. I think the real story is this model is absolutely performing. We're proud of our retention rate and the way we're competing in the marketplace and then really importantly, the uptake that our clients have with our core solutions. We're proud of the way we are deploying capital and you should continue to expect us to be very disciplined, but also very aggressive as it relates to returning cash to our shareholders through both good investments as well as share buybacks and pay down of debt and all the other things that we know we're responsible for. So, we are very confident. We look forward to talking to all of you on December 14 when we give you our 2018 guidance. Thank you.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Also, Tom Mac Mahon will continue as Lead Independent Director of our board.","I want to highlight two other recent additions to our leadership team. Marty Akins, who has been with the company 14 years in a number of important roles in our legal department, has recently been named General Counsel. Marty has deep expertise in corporate governance, client contracting, M&A and our specialty business. Few people in our company know our business from as many perspectives as Marty. His insights and counsel will be valuable as we grow Express Scripts.","In addition, today, you'll hear from Eric. Our new CFO was most recently at Gentiva Health Services, a leading provider of home health, hospice and community care services. In addition, Eric has held executive roles with Centene and Cardinal Health. He has a solid track record of driving strong performance and we expect he will do the same at Express Scripts. His financial expertise and understanding of the healthcare industry are a great combination.","I also thank Jim Havel for serving as our interim CFO. I am pleased that he will stay on for the next several months to ensure a smooth transition.","Over the past 30 years, we have built and expanded our core business while continually evolving to keep our clients ahead of the changing healthcare environment. Today, there is more talk than ever about the cost of drugs. Whether it's a pharmaceutical company increasing the price of an old generic drug overnight or a biotech charging hundreds of thousands of dollars for a new drug, payers are facing unprecedented challenges.","The good news for our clients is they have Express Scripts in their corner. We stand fully aligned with payers to control costs and improve care. No one approaches pharmacy benefit management like we do. Our clients value our unique combination of focused scale, specialized care, and pharmacy innovation, which ensures they and their 85 million members get the most value from the pharmacy benefit.","I am particularly proud of the bold actions we take to control costs, drive out waste and improve care. Because we are fully aligned with clients and they trust us, we take the actions others in our industry cannot or will not take. One great example of our leadership is in the improving access to the cure for hepatitis C.","Before Eric provides an update on our quarterly financial results, I would like to invite Dr. Stettin to provide some context on two topics. First, our decision to prefer Viekira Pak on our National Preferred Formulary in situations where is it is known to be safe and effective. And second, and what makes our Accredo specialty pharmacy unique. Dr. Stettin founded our therapeutic resource center model and currently leads our technology and innovation center. He is an instrumental leader in our company and specializes in all clinical matters.","Now, I'd like for him to share his perspective with you.","Glen D. Stettin - Senior Vice President - Clinical, Research & New Solutions & Chief Innovation Officer","Thank you, George. And good morning, everyone. You'll recall last December, our independent pharmacy and therapeutics committee evaluated the curative therapies available for hepatitis C. They found them to be equivalent in terms of safety and efficacy in most situations. That allowed us to then leverage our national preferred formulary, the biggest in the country, covering approximately 25 million Americans to ensure a broad, cost-effective access to innovation. We selected Viekira Pak for our national preferred formulary, dispensed through the Accredo specialty pharmacy as the preferred agent for patients with genotype 1 hepatitis C to deliver on the promise of a curative therapy for hepatitis C patients.","The risk of using Viekira Pak in patients with severe liver disease was known and addressed as we defined policies for exception coverage when the drug was approved last December. We proactively put a clinical process in place to manage the small population of patients with more severe liver disease who might require an alternative to Viekira Pak. From the very beginning, we recommended and approved other therapies in this subgroup.","Last week, the FDA revised its label for the use of Viekira Pak for these patients. Given our original position and actions, the change in label does not impact the availability of Viekira Pak for patients for whom it is safe and effective, nor does it impact our utilization projections. As such, we don't expect any financial impact to Express Scripts for our clients. It is also important to note that we have not had any client disruption regarding Viekira Pak as a result of the FDA alert. Our mission is to make medicine safer and more affordable. By maintaining a clinical focus and keeping patients first, we achieve both.","Also this past week, you've heard about what I'll call \"specialty pharmacies\" set up and owned by manufacturers to distribute a certain drug. I want to take a moment to reinforce our specialty model.","At Accredo, we ensure patients with complex and chronic diseases get the medications they need. Accredo serves patients who take specialty drugs, which are often life-sustaining medications with complex regimens. These drugs require a high-touch specialized care model. We make sure special handling requirements are met for certain drugs, and we put our deep knowledge to work to improve patient adherence. We have specialists, pharmacists and nurses within our therapeutic resource centers dedicated to the care of patients with needs in specific therapy classes.","For example, we don't just have an oncology TRC, we have pharmacists who specialize in specific types of cancer. Our pharmacists interact with thousands of specialty patients each day. Every interaction increases our knowledge and understanding of complex diseases, allowing us to provide better, more personal care. Specialty drugs are also high cost, so we spend time helping our patients who need it get financial assistance to help gain access whenever possible.","Accredo means specialized personal care delivered by experts. Accredo represents the best of specialty pharmacy and represents what our clients and patients want; expert care that's always available. Our clients trust us to take great care of their patients, which, in turn, allows us to put in place clinical programs like our Hepatitis Cure Value Program and our Cholesterol Care Value Program. Our formulary management and specialty pharmacy capabilities are only two examples of how Express Scripts provides a fundamentally better experience for clients and patients. These solutions create value for clients and create opportunities for growth.","I'll now hand it over to Eric to discuss our quarterly financial performance.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Before we get to the results, let me take a moment to share why I came to Express Scripts. First and foremost, it is simply a great company with an outstanding leadership team and an exciting future. As you know, the healthcare landscape is challenging and rapidly evolving. In light of those challenges, there is an incredible opportunity to help chart the future course for Express Scripts. With a diverse payer base, the ability to deliver specialized patient care, and a unique collection of solutions and businesses, we are well positioned to transform the practice of healthcare.","It is an extraordinary opportunity for our company, our clients and for me personally. I am excited to work with George and Tim and our leadership team to truly change healthcare for the better. My priorities from a financial perspective align with those of this leadership team \u2013 to maximize return on invested capital, manage expenses and working capital, and optimize our capital structure. Through our business model of alignment, we manage trend to lower cost for our clients and improve the health outcomes for our members, resulting in enhanced value for our shareholders.","I am excited to have joined Express Scripts and also to provide you with this overview of our third quarter financial performance. We reported adjusted EPS of $1.45, which represents an increase of 12% year-over-year and is $0.02 above the midpoint of our guidance range. Adjusted EBITDA continues to be strong, increasing 4% year-over-year as a result of managing specialty, formulary management and an increase in the aggregate generic fill rate.","Other key metric highlights include adjusted claims worth $328.3 million. Adjusted SG&A expenses increased 2% year-over-year as we continued to invest in our future and enhance our member and client experience in home delivery and specialty. We generated adjusted EBITDA of $1.8 billion, resulting in adjusted EBITDA per claim of $5.51, an increase of 4% year-over-year. Finally, we generated $793 million of operating cash flow during the quarter. We also deployed approximately $1.2 billion of cash to repay debt during the quarter.","Now, I will make a few comments about our 2015 guidance. We narrowed the total adjusted claims guidance range to $1.29 billion to $1.31 billion, maintaining the previously guided midpoint. We are increasing our adjusted SG&A midpoint guidance range by $50 million, reflecting our continued commitment to invest in our future. However, due to our strong operating performance, we increased and tightened our adjusted EBITDA guidance range to $7 billion to $7.1 billion, our adjusted EBITDA per claim guidance range to $5.37 to $5.47, and our adjusted EPS guidance range to $5.51 to $5.55 which represents 13% to 14% growth over 2014.","In summary, we delivered solid results for the third quarter and project continued growth in the fourth quarter.","Now, I will turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Thank you, Eric. First, I want to thank George and the board for their confidence in me. It is humbling and exciting to lead 30,000 of my colleagues in doing the important work of making medicine more affordable and accessible for the 85 million people and 3,000 clients we serve. There is no greater opportunity in healthcare today.","As you can see from our third quarter results, we are winning in the marketplace and driving shareholder value. Let me provide some perspective on why. The past 18 months have represented a critically important journey for us as a company. Our business model of alignment resonates with new and existing clients, our independence is increasingly a differentiator, and we are raising the bar in client and patient experience.","We have steadily strengthened our operations, introduced novel solutions and redefined what leadership means in our industry. This has led to strong selling and renewal season. Therefore, we are increasing the low end of our retention rate from 95% to 96%, and our range is now 96% to 97%, excluding Coventry. We are confident in our direction because our clients place their confidence and trust in us.","In addition, our pipeline of new business is as robust as I've ever seen. Based on our results this year, we are confident about next year's selling and retention season. Our service model, differentiated solutions, bold actions and strong client relationships position us well for 2016. We will keep our clients and patients in the center of everything we do.","The work we do has never been more important today and in the future. And when I look at our future, you should expect us to continue to take bold actions our clients have come to expect. Just a few weeks ago, we provided another example of what Express Scripts uniquely can do in the marketplace with our formulary decision on PCSK9 inhibitors. As Dr. Stettin mentioned earlier regarding hepatitis C, we are putting in place strong clinical programs to manage high cost drugs for large patient populations.","I wanted to take a moment to talk about the two PCSK9 drugs that were recently approved and that we were able to put on our formulary through our Cholesterol Care Value program. Once again, we leveraged our leadership position to create access for new innovations and ensure industry-leading pricing for our clients.","Importantly, we also leveraged our therapeutic resource center model to employ utilization management tools that ensure only patients who have a real clinical need for PCSK9 inhibitors receive them. If you compare plan sponsors who will closely manage PCSK9 inhibitors against those who do not, we project a significant difference in spending on this class. Tight management of PCSK9 inhibitors will have a huge impact for our clients positively and is the right thing to do for patients.","The financial impact may vary depending on the client's overall plan design, size and industry, but the benefit is clear as is the solution we uniquely bring to the market. It is critical to manage the entire benefit as tightly as possible to derive the most value for our clients, and this includes minimizing price and optimizing health outcomes for our patients.","As my team and I look ahead, we start with unique assets and an unambiguous core mission, aligning with clients and their strategies while caring for patients and improving their health outcomes. As George said, we take bold actions to control costs, drive out waste and improve care. We do what others won't because we are fully aligned with clients. That will never change.","The relevance of our model and the work that we do have never been more important to our clients. For example, we continue to have significant opportunities for our creative leadership in supply chain management. Also, specialty pharmacy care will be core to our focus as a growing stand-alone PBM.","At Express Scripts, standing alone has never meant standing still or doing more of the same. We've redefined our industry and changed healthcare for 30 years and we are well positioned to do the same for the next 30 years. However, we will evolve what it means to have a laser focus on clients and patients. We will stay at the forefront of innovation, including building upon our unique clinical focus and ability to leverage actionable data to help clients better assess and manage risk. Further, we will create even more differentiated and better outcomes by transforming our member experience across all channels to help patients effectively navigate a complex healthcare system.","We will broaden our M&A capability, creating opportunities and expanding the solutions that we offer payers, patients, providers and pharma. As an example, our UBC business has strong relationships with key pharma players and represents a starting point to expand and bolt on additional services and capabilities to help pharma develop and launch innovative products more safely and effectively. This is important. We will provide the view of the client to pharma as they evaluate and set pricing for new product launches and this is just one area we are exploring.","Throughout our business, there are many more opportunities. As always, though, we will maintain strong financial discipline in assessing opportunities. But I'm excited about the future of our company, including the growth opportunities that will enhance our business.","We will now take your questions. Thank you. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Mr. Robert Willoughby of Bank of America. Sir, your line is open.","Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi. Good morning. This is Elizabeth in for Bob Willoughby today. Obviously a big cash flow quarter is implied with your fourth quarter results and with the ASR ongoing. Should we assume that you continue to pay down the term loan, or are there other more productive means to deploy your capital near term?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. Hey. This is Eric. You know, we will be looking at a lot of opportunities around that cash flow. That's really driven a lot by our part D business which drives a pretty significant fourth quarter cash flow opportunity for the company, given the way that Medicaid reimburses. So \u2013 excuse me, Medicare. So, again, still looking at that and looking at the opportunities and how to best deploy it as we move ahead.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know, we always take our cash and look at the opportunities, and whether it's investing in our future or whether it's buying back stock or whether it's looking at our debt levels, we evaluate that on a continued basis. We give projections with respect to our cash flow, but we like to keep our flexibility based on opportunities as they approach. And so we'll provide better \u2013 more guidance to that when we give next year's earnings guidance.","Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Ms. Lisa Gill of JP Morgan. Ma'am, your line is open.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. And good morning, everyone. George, of course, I have to start with the first question of the transaction that was announced between Walgreens and Rite Aid. I know over several quarters we've talked about potential opportunities to work more closely with some of the retailers in the market. Can you talk about your expectation, if this changes anything from your perspective on your relationship with retailers?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. You know, retailers are a very important component of our business because there's a lot of acute medications out there that need to be taken immediately. In addition, some members prefer retail. So retail has always been a high priority for us, just as mail and specialty are as well. Over the years, especially over the last several years, there's been a change of management at Walgreens. And that's actually worked the better for us. We have very strong relationships there. We're in constant communication. I talk with Stefano (24:33), and Tim talks with Alex (24:35), and our teams up and down the line communicate on a regular basis. So, we believe these relationships are getting stronger, the opportunities are good. What we like is we like to have choices for our clients. And as you know, clients are looking to better manage their overall drug expense. And so to the extent that we have opportunities to use networks that are new and improving way, that's always positive for us. So we'll \u2013 it's awful early to say how all of this is going to play out and what the company is going to look like as it goes through the FTC process. But we'll certainly keep our eyes on that, and we'll keep up our communications with Walgreens and CVS, for that matter.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I think if I recall last quarter, I asked you and Tim about your thoughts around business that you've signed for 2016, what people are looking for. And you said, as we get further along in the selling season, come back and ask again. So here I am again. Can you maybe just give us some indication? I think you talked about a very strong selling season for new business wins, obviously strong retention. You or Tim, can you maybe just give us some color as to what people are buying as we think about 2016? And how do we think about this? You know, obviously your programs around formulary management have done well, specialty, et cetera. But if you can just give us any indication as to how to think about that business and along those lines, how to think about the profitability of that business as we move into 2016 would be very helpful. Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely, Lisa. You know, I'll start and I'll turn it over to Tim. But, I think if you go back \u2013 I've been in this business for a long time, if you go back 15 years ago, let's just pick a period, clients were really looking at making sure they had a portfolio of options for their membership. And costs were raising at a very high rate. But the focus was really \u2013 because, you know, at the end of the day, even though costs were going up, as a percentage of overall cost, it wasn't nearly as great as it is today. And so clients were looking at plan designs, the impact it was going to have, and we were doing a lot of consultative items there and doing some rebate analysis. But the world's really changed. And it's what Glen Stettin was talking about, Dr. Stettin, around the advent of these new drugs coming to market. It's about manufacturers and pharma buying other pharma companies and significantly raising the cost.","Clients are looking for solutions. The world has gotten much more sophisticated around healthcare in general, and it's not enough to have access. It's not enough to have 90-day retail or mail order or any type of retail solution. It's about how do I control my overall cost. The economy is not the greatest. It's growing but not at rates that we historically have had back before 2008. And so the cost of every element of the income statement is under tight scrutiny. CFO's need solutions, and HR directors and benefit design people come to us and look for those solutions. And I think we have a very broad, unbiased approach to the market that can give them a spectrum of answers.","What happens here is they issue an RFP, and the RFP is looking for a bushel basket cost. But that's just the starting point. What Dave Queller and his whole team do is they go out there, use those RFPs as an entry into that client conversation to lay out opportunities and programs to drive down that cost and take the edge off of price, price inflation and cost.","Our clinical programs are incredibly important. The work we've done with our formularies is critically important. The work we do with networks is critically important. It's the package together and the unbiased, uncompromised approach we can bring to the market is what clients are looking for.","With respect to where that sits and how, I'm going to let Tim discuss sales activities and certainly, you can see the numbers in retention.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure. George has hit a lot of the points that I'd make. I think if you dissect it down to the sort of two major elements of the market being direct payers and then health plans, what I'd say is in health plans, supporting their brand, helping them grow in their markets, helping them stay regulatory compliant and showing our rock solid \u2013 our Star Rating results were extraordinarily strong this year for our clients, those were the \u2013 and helping them manage risk.","We're actually seeing, and I know we'll get questions later because it doesn't show up in the numbers today, but the focus on mail, we are long-term bulls on mail. We see health plans this year looking at mail for their health exchange populations in much more significant numbers than we have. It's going to take time. But I think when the results come in, we'll see that continue and there's been a lot of interest in that.","Specialty even in our health plan, again, much more interest in narrowing down to Accredo and including Accredo in a focused way.","On the employer side, I'd say supporting an increasing kind of consumer model and the way we integrate with their systems and their other vendors to help empower that.","Formulary and specialty, very important. Our formulary is a strong reason that we win and retain business there because, not just because it's effective from a cost standpoint, but because the proof of the pudding is then we've been able to manage it with literally no member noise. And so we're able to achieve some guard rails and consumerism on the formulary side while at the same time helping these plans maintain their overall risk profile.","I would finally say wrapping all of that up, I would broadly determine the member experience. There was no question, I said in my prepared remarks. Our focus on the patient and the member and the many, many elements of that strategy as we take it to our clients and engage with them to help design it in our lab, and we have had hundreds of clients this year in our lab, hundreds, is a transformational to a relationship sort of model because of the fact you're now not just bringing the products out or the way you do things out and putting it under desk, you're engaging and collaborating to customize it or to make sure that's meeting their needs in ways that help us drive innovation as well.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate all those comments. Is there any way to put any numbers around any of that to say that we grew from X percent to Y percent for 2016 as far as whether it's specialty, Tim, or moving towards your formulary management? Is there any way to quantify any of that at this point? And I know George is thinking like we're not giving guidance at this point. I'm not looking for guidance; just more of directionally how do we think about percentage of your customers that are participating in these programs. Any kind of number would just be helpful and I appreciate all the comments.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, why don't we do this? Why don't we \u2013 we have numbers but they haven't been set through the process. Why don't we do this? When we give our guidance, we will give you some of those numbers, and we will show you our specialty uptake as a percentage of our clients. We can show you...","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Formulary.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...how many clients have actually chosen Select Home Delivery and mandatory mail and those type programs and show you some of these \u2013 our formulary decision process and what's taking place.","It's important to note because we talk a lot about 25 million members on our NPF, but it's also important because we got 85 million members, so what happens to the rest of the 60 million? Well, with the health plans, often they have their own P&T committees so they set their own programs, but both Dr. Stettin and Dr. Miller work very closely with those health plan P&T committees. So even if we're not perfectly aligned, the idea is that those classes that truly matter, that drive the best economic value, can we align those out to drive the best value for them? And I think one of the reasons we have such a high retention rate for our health plans is because we can customize the approach yet to make sure that they stay inside the sweet spot of savings. And so, we'll try to give better information when we give our 2016 guidance.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I appreciate that. Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions here. First of all, obviously you have a strong end to the selling season and the range for retention. You did not change 2016 volume guide. Are you seeing some change in the environment or utilization environment that keeps you on the sideline, or is it just too early to make an update?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. First, there's two pieces to this. It is too early to provide an update because we're still on the throes of our middle market selling season and retention efforts, but that's going well but we're not prepared to really speak to it in any kind of exact numbers. But you also read it in the paper the other day about healthcare reform and the fact that members aren't signing up at the rates that they historically \u2013 or that they projected to be signing up for.","Our health plans across the board have effective felt that. And so what the initial numbers they give us have a certain level of uptake for healthcare reform lives and those haven't materialized and it's too soon. We're just now into the open enrollment process, so it's too early to tell what 2016 is going to look like.","You probably have seen that premiums have gone up significantly in this situation in an economy that's \u2013 I'm not saying it's bleak, but it's not as strong as we would have liked to have seen and so how does that impact members' renewal rates and what decisions they choose? So it's really kind of early.","We also know as the economy slows, for years, Ricky, in the early part of my career throughout the 1990s and the early 2000s, we used to see no matter what the cycle was, utilization not only stayed strong but grew and grew at significant rates. But you got to remember in those days, there were new cholesterol elements coming to the market, new hypertensive drugs coming to the market, new cures for cancer at a very fast rate and these were pills which, although expensive, didn't equate to what specialty drugs equate to.","I would say the world is a little different today. As we look at softening markets, utilization is down and you see the numbers and that's going across the board. I think our job actually is gets emphasized because as \u2013 even though utilization may be down, our tools matter, especially when there's pharma companies and others that are raising rates at alarming rates. We can implement our tools and we get paid to put those tools in place.","And so we've been able to show in our numbers that we can grow EBITDA per Rx. So even if Rxs aren't growing at a historical level, we're still growing profits. And I think that's what's needed is for a company that can be unbiased in its decisions and lead with creative solutions that can drive.","There was a \u2013 I saw some of the headline news about our revenue line and it being somewhat weak. Well, that's actually a testament to our business model again. When our revenues are weaker and we're hitting our claim counts, that means we are more than doing our job because our revenue lines is our clients' cost trends. And so, if we can drive down revenue while keeping the Rx line up, that is a big testament and a benefit for our clients and, of course, that's the output of using more generics, of driving higher rebates.","Rebates to our clients are our contra revenue accounts, so they drive down revenues. And so, there's \u2013 the things you that see in those numbers shouldn't be viewed as missing, but as a heck of a positive in fulfilling our mission in driving our core mission, which is to drive down the cost of healthcare and drive up health outcomes.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, George, that really kind of like fits into kind of like my follow-up question which is around rebates. So can you maybe speak to the contribution of rebates in the quarter versus historical? And how should we think about the flow of the rebates through the P&L, i.e., kind of like revenues versus gross profit? Because to your point, I mean, revenue were kind of particularly low but gross profit were kind of like higher than what we expected. So how does that impact from the rebate dynamic and is this something that we can think of sustainable going forward?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So, the rebates are much stronger. As you know, the hepatitis C, you've got the whole situation with the PCSK9s, although very small to start with, but it'll have an impact as we go forward. Specialty, as you know, over the last, I don't know, five years, six years, we've been really working to limit access and given therapy classes like MS where there's a number of drugs, to try to get the portfolio down to a manageable level then drive adherence and usage in this given drug so that we can get better discounts for our clients.","So to the extent that the rebates are given to the clients, it's a negative revenue number. So it reduces revenues. To the extent we keep it, then it goes against our cost of goods sold which both of which have the impact of improving gross profits.","So what you see in our numbers, and the reason gross profit is up, is because of higher rebates and better generic fill rates and quite frankly, we also do a pretty good job through our integration activities. Chris Houston and her team work hard to drive down costs of our direct processing costs. So as we're getting through the integration processes, that has an impact on gross profit as well. So it's a combination of all of those things that are working together to drive up gross profit.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. It's Stephan, actually, calling in for Bob. Just wanted to follow up on the revenue. Revenue per script, especially in the network side of things, was particularly low as you guys were referencing. Was there anything beyond rebates that might have driven that? Was inflation may be lower than it had been in the first half of the year across brand and generics, for example?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, it wasn't inflation. Inflation is staying very strong. It really is the combination of client mix and rebates and generics that drive down those costs. And keep in mind, it's also formulary management.","If we can move a client from a high cost drug to another drug cost in the same class, the reason we do that is to drive better rebates but also to drive the overall cost of the drug down and all those things have an impact. And then client mix always has some impact on the overall cost so it's how the plan designs are set. But as my earlier statement, I think when you see revenues per script coming down, it's really a good thing as long as you see gross profit per script going up as well.","Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And just one quick follow-up. I know it's still a bit early, but I was hoping you could comment on any PCSK9 volumes so far.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I can let Dr. Stettin address that, but I can also tell you that they've been \u2013 because of our clinical programs, they've been extremely low, but it's because we're doing the right thing. Those people that need the drugs get it. The people that don't, that should first try a statin, are on that first.","Glen D. Stettin - Senior Vice President - Clinical, Research & New Solutions & Chief Innovation Officer","Sure. So our volume has been relatively low. And I would point out that the vast majority of requests that we're seeing are for patient who have not either tried or been treated to maximum doses with statins or don't have the indications that are in the FDA label. So we're doing the right job for both the patients and for the customers who are paying the bill to ensure that the drugs are being used in the appropriate patients. So volume is low, it's been increasing slowly and that's as much as I can say.","Stephan Stewart - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I have a question for Tim. With respect to brand inflation, which obviously is getting a lot of press in the political scene, how is that impacting the conversation with customers? And I think we've all learned a lot about gross to net, have the customers gone along on that journey? And I would assume that suggests that the PBMs are really getting their job done when you look at the delta between gross and net.","And then I think to bring it back to your economic specifically, is it easier to capture gross margin or to capture your fair share in a strong inflationary environment? And does that change should we enter a less inflationary environment?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure. Thanks for the question. As you can imagine, our clients have been extraordinarily supportive of the position that we have continued to take and not only at a macro level advocating on their behalf, both in Washington as well as with the supply chain, but at a very specific level, whether it's the introduction of new therapies or attacking something like compounds and so forth.","And so, it's not just a one-trick piece because of the inflation. The dynamics that are hitting clients are multifold and therefore, our strategies are multifold. That's why Dr. Stettin is the busiest man in show business along with Dr. Miller because we are out on all of those levels. And so, they're great conversations. Clients absolutely look at it from a net perspective, and from our perspective, we demonstrate that.","And what I would tell you is, in high inflationary times then, we are very focused on creating that value for our clients and passing through the value that we're able to get. But there are so many levers that create so much value for our clients and for our company, whether it's new products, specialty, and so forth, that we \u2013 I would not therefore jump to the conclusion if the inflation were lower that suddenly our reason to exist would not be strong. Our reason to exist is very strong even in a no inflation scenario.","Witness new generics coming out this quarter. Witness again some of these key new products. From our standpoint, the way we align with clients in our financials benefits us almost no matter what happens.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's important to look back over history. If you look back at Express Scripts' history, we've been around close to 30 years now and so we've lived through a lot of interest rate cycles during that period. And if you go back to whether it's high inflationary periods or flat to zero inflationary periods, our economic growth stayed strong. And the reason is exactly what Tim just said. The solutions are different and customized based on the environment in which we operate.","So, Tim summed it up, but I think that the history of our results speak to inflation is just one of the many aspects for which our tools work. And if it's zero to down, then it's \u2013 there's other aspects and other opportunities to drive value into our book of business.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","So my follow-up would be on one of those tools, the Cholesterol Care program seems notable. I know the number of PCSK9 scripts is low, but as we look at that program, is the intention there to manage and monitor every patient who could be at risk or at \u2013 possibly use a PCSK9? And does that program involve moving to mail in advance of any movement to PCSK9s?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I love the question. And I'm going to turn it over to Glen to answer since he's the architect of that program, along with our supply chain leadership.","Glen D. Stettin - Senior Vice President - Clinical, Research & New Solutions & Chief Innovation Officer","Sure. So the PCSK9 inhibitors are managed as part of our Cholesterol Care Value program. And as part of that program, these drugs are being dispensed inclusively through the high cholesterol PRC that's part of Accredo. So that's a requirement for the program.","In addition, we're looking at utilization and utilization management specifically for ensuring that it's not everyone who asks for prescription for the medication, but those people who really qualify based on clinical need and the FDA label. And then beyond that, it's about supporting the patient to be adherent with this injectable medication so that they get the lower cholesterol and the true value out of the -that the medication that has to offer them.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And so just to the put the icing on that, yes, we manage each and every patient for which has come into the PRC that has a prescription for this drug.","Glen D. Stettin - Senior Vice President - Clinical, Research & New Solutions & Chief Innovation Officer","Yeah, and in fact, to take it one step further, the conversations we've had with clients that they've been very supportive of is as this class evolves over the next several years as it's predicted to, managing entire population of statin users, or even potentially a broader population inside of our high control pharmacy environment is, in fact, the way we think about ultimately creating maximum value for the patients, the clients, and frankly, for us.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","That sounds like a very large group or a very large population. Is this an opt-in or an opt-out? And what has that experience been?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So what I would tell you at this point, we actually \u2013 I'm going to let Glenn speak to this. He's talked to lots and lots of clients about this program.","Glen D. Stettin - Senior Vice President - Clinical, Research & New Solutions & Chief Innovation Officer","Sure. So this is a program that dovetails very nicely with the National Preferred Formulary. So the majority of our clients that participate in the National Preferred Formulary are participating in the Cholesterol Care Value Program, just as they are with the Hepatitis C Cure Value Program. So the client participates, and the members then if they want access to the medication, we're delivering it through the Accredo pharmacy.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You know for the client, this is a huge savings opportunity. And it's not just about money. At the end of the day, there's people that are at severe risk of stroke or heart attack that need to be helped. And so this question is, how I do get the best performance out of my employees while making sure I'm controlling my overall cost? And so putting a program in place like this with specialists who understand the disease state, understand the patients, and making sure that those patients that need it get it, that's what we get paid to do. And it's a great opportunity for us, it's a great opportunity for our clients, and it's even a better opportunity for our patients.","Eric R Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. Congratulations to Tim and also Eric on your new roles.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Thank you.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","First, Tim, you mentioned improving star ratings for your clients. But you guys have also done a better job in your own ratings and bidding in your top regions for 2015 than last year. So I'm wondering, is this due to just better blocking and tackling this year as you're arguably more focused? Or is this more of a conscious, strategic shift in focus more towards government programs?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Well understanding what it is, is we have a large book of health plan business who are extraordinarily focused strategically on growing their footprint in these regulated markets. That has caused us to invest, as you've heard us talk about before, in ensuring that we've got the right package of solutions, whether that's in terms of helping them assess and manage risk even outside their provider \u2013 or inside the provider group, for example, as well as inside a pharmacy. And so the natural spillover of doing really well for our clients is that our own PDP gets sharper and smarter as it relates to the way we are able to assess and go out and price and manage risk. So the important strategic thought, though, is that we've got clients that we are going to keep in the game and help win in their regulated markets. And we're going to use our IT leverage and our ability to invest once for many is almost a service, so as to help them then execute their strategies in unique markets.","For example, recently our client in California, SCAN, along with us, talked about a retail solution. So this is beyond just keeping the core systems regulatory compliant. It's been about working collaboratively in specific markets to deliver specific solutions that align to the goal of the client, and you should expect to see that continue. And yes, that is definitely a strategic focus.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay. And follow-up is on mail order. I thought there was supposed to be a substantial upgrade to your mail order website a couple of months ago. So I guess, first, how did that go against plan and how are you thinking about it impacting first time in repeat mail order usage? And second, you've focused on mail order and reinventing mail order hiring external talent earlier on this year. So how far are we along the process after this major new upgrade?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure. So first of all, let me be clear, a website launch is just that, right? And it's a piece of the member experience strategy that we look at across a spectrum and across an investment horizon over a number of years. It went very well, is the first answer. And for us, it demonstrated conclusively that well-engineered member interface can produce differentiated outcomes because the member is happy, because we're listening to their feedback and because we're integrating into the experience in such a way as to make that experience for them familiar and comfortable and usable.","And so to be very specific with you, the big change that was made in our launch that was very successful involved showing our members at the front page of the website, and there were many other changes, but the big a-ha for us was aggregating their savings opportunities that we were able to scrape by analyzing their data and bringing it to the front page of their website page, of their personal website page. And what we have found in doing that is the conversion rate of those patients to the optimal choice, which benefits our client because anything that we're going to recommend to a patient is also going to be something that benefits our clients. We saw a near doubling of the patient response rate as it relates to \u2013 and literally the next day as it relates to the launching of that website.","So that is what I would call a good start. We have a lot of work left to do. We've just relaunched our iPhone app and our Android app with iTouch or the finger touch security. First of all, better security. Secondly, makes members a lot happier and it's, again, an indicator where we're heading but we've got more to do. That being said, we are bulls on mail as I've said before and I think the longer-term strategy here, we've been able to align a number of new outside resources and importantly a number of our inside resources across our IT and our member experience platforms to really begin to collaborate on inventing the future as it's relates to how our members are going to interact with us.","And importantly, while the longer-term payoff for that is hopefully members going to the channel that makes the most sense, let me be real clear about that, and often that's mail and from our perspective. The shorter-term benefits show up and you won't see it in the numbers that we break out as clearly, in our operating costs, because anything we do that takes phone calls out of the system and makes our system easier for a member to interface with and get the answer they need through self-service mechanisms immediately drives down cost even as it improves the ultimate long-term outcomes and how they interface with us.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's very useful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Your line is now open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Just to go back to the inflation topic, given your extensive sourcing work, can you give \u2013 maybe quantify the sort of inflation rates that you're seeing? Manufacturers at least attempt to put through in brand and specialty?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So specialty drugs have been \u2013 it really depends on class. So we're talking about weighted averages, but you're running in the very high teens, 16% \u2013 14% to 16% inflationary rates. Some are much worse and some aren't nearly as bad depending on the drug, but the effect to the client. On the branded side, you're seeing price increases over 10% this year and that's \u2013 those are big numbers.","When you're having those type of inflationary effects \u2013 it's not that those just go through our \u2013 affect us or help us, we need to go make sure that our clients that there's better alternatives so somebody is not raising their prices nearly as fast to shift on the move and make sure that we can make the right formulary decisions and drug decisions for our clients to either, one, capture that inflationary cost back for our clients and members or two, if it persists to look at other options. So it's a thing we have to manage in high inflationary periods. And, again, in lower inflationary periods, we manage other aspects, whether it's plan designs or retail mail mix or just still particular formularies because of overall high ingredient costs.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks, George. And then follow-up, can you just remind us how you expect payer consolidation that we're already aware of, how that will influence your claims volume over the next year or two? Have your expectations for the Coventry roll-off changed at all, for example?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Obviously we haven't given 2016 guidance, but Coventry is rolling off and it's affecting us this year and next year, and so we'll provide that guidance to you with our 2016 guidance.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Any other planned consolidation transactions that you think will be notable that we should keep in mind as we think about next year?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. You know, I think the retention rates are extremely good. You know, I've been at this, again, John, as you know, for a lot of years, as has Tim, and in all the years I was with Express Scripts, we never had this level of retention. And so, I think this is a real testament to the team, what they're doing, our approach to the marketplace, our tools, the sophistication that's occurring within our health plans and our commercial clients that are choosing our services. So I really do think it endorses our model, what we do, and our approach to the marketplace.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, and congratulations to all you three guys, George on the retirement and Tim on the promotion and Eric on the new job. So first question, with all the noise around Valiant and specialty pharmacies, are you guys seeing increased discussion on \u2013 from payers and your clients to roll out more aggressive specialty tools, whether it's more narrowing the networks and just putting in more regulations around dispenser specialty?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Absolutely. It is definitely something we have seen. You know, as you know, it's hard for you guys to see it in our volumes, but our specialty volumes show that clients are increasing narrowing to us so that it's getting managed for that entire population of a class. So yeah. I mean, the short answer is, yes. It's for us in that respect, it's another element of us doing our job. It create a reason for us to get in, talk to the client and show them solutions. You know, the other piece is formulary.","Again, these \u2013 often these products \u2013 sometimes these products are on the medical side and so we can do data mining for our clients and show it to them and help them understand the challenge and help them engage with their health plans, but where it's not on that side, then we're able to get in and either shut it down, find alternatives, or quantify it and deal with that in their budgeting process.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Thanks for that color, Tim. And then, George, just to follow-up on your comment, you're right, this is probably one of the best retention rates we've seen. So just qualitatively, is there anything different that we should think about as it relates to the renewed contracts in terms of the margin profile that we should expect in year one since it's a little bit higher than usual?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The retention rate is up and I think one of the comments I've always said is you never want a retention rate of 100% because that means we're not doing our job in the marketplace. I think the only \u2013 what I've seen evolve, though, and what's coming to light this year is the challenges our payers are facing with your \u2013 the comments you made a minute ago with some of the pharma moves and some of the opportunities in drug launches really highlights our skill set. And I think what's helping drive our adherence rate is, one, clearly is a focus on customer service and reporting and member service but the second one is unique and better solutions that are more valued today.","We go back to the years when Barrett was the CEO here and I was CFO, we were always rolling out solutions and then trying to address the cost side but it didn't get the same level of New York Times and Wall Street Journal press that they get today. So, today our tools are more important than ever for meeting the needs of an evolving healthcare sophistication that exists. And so I really feel like at this point in time, our retention is not only the great service and relationships we have, but it really is our bag of solutions that resonate with our clients.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks, guys.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Why don't we do just one more question?","Operator","Okay. Our last question comes from the line of David Larson of Leerink.","Chris E. Abbott - Leerink Partners LLC","Yeah. Thanks for sneaking me in. This is Chris Abbott in for David. So with the PCSK9 class that you obviously have talked about a bit, but you took a different approach from your exclusions to the hep C class. What's different about these PCSK9 drugs that made it more compelling for you to include both Praluent and Repatha? And what's the customer reaction been so far to that announcement?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I'll start, and then I'll let Glen \u2013 first of all, let me start with the most important point. Customer reactions that incredibly supportive and grateful because creating access and keeping the ability to manage this closely were the two critical dimensions along with getting unit price right. And I would say one of the fundamental differences here was that we were fortunately engaged with both originators of these innovative products very early on. We are able to have iterative discussions about the care models, about the management models and about appropriate unit pricing. And ultimately getting to the end point that we got to was something where all of the parties were supportive of getting to the right place. That's always our goal.","I think I've said before, our goal is to make maximum access available, but at our cost our payers and patients can handle. And in this case, both manufacturers worked with us to allow for that. And basically, they will not be competing at the physician's office. We will be managing the patients. And so from that standpoint, it worked well all the way.","Glen, any color you want to add there?","Glen D. Stettin - Senior Vice President - Clinical, Research & New Solutions & Chief Innovation Officer","Sure. So while we've built a reputation as a company by making bold moves on behalf of our customers to save them money and make sure their patients get the best care at the best price, I think that translates into some people believing that we want to exclude drugs or have only a few drugs in the category. The facts are that we prefer to have every drug available for every patient where it makes sense. Unfortunately, the economics don't always work that way in order to be able to provide the most affordable access to the drugs people need. So when it makes sense to exclude a drug from the formulary or do what we've done with regard to retail networks and other actions that we've taken over time. Obviously we're going to do what our customers need us to do. But where we can get great value for our clients and have more than one drug available in the category, that's a fabulous thing as well.","Chris E. Abbott - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And I know you typically set your formularies in August and then, I imagine, reevaluate over the year, but historically, there haven't been too many changes midyear. Are you able to review the exclusions on a rolling basis as the plan year proceeds? Or does that really create too much disruption and you get pushback from clients?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So while we have opportunities to make changes and if the new clinical information comes out that causes us to revise the policy or what have you, we can and do. On the other hand, our preference is to set up our contracting such that it doesn't make sense for on purely economic reasons to make changes during the calendar year. And we can provide ongoing and thoughtful access for patients for the medications that they need to stay healthy and continue to deliver good pricing and value for the customers.","Glen D. Stettin - Senior Vice President - Clinical, Research & New Solutions & Chief Innovation Officer","The only thing I'll add to that is, however, if a drug price does fight for some reason, we do have the flexibility and we have the allegiance of our clients and the trust of our clients to make off-cycle changes when appropriate. And we've had to take those actions in the past, and we will continue to take those actions to make sure we're properly managing the health outcomes of our patients while maintaining the cost for our clients and patients. So it's an important part of our business.","Chris E. Abbott - Leerink Partners LLC","Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, again, I want to thank everyone for joining us on this call today. I think our results speak to our commitment to driving down cost while improving health outcomes. And we look forward to talking to you all again soon. Thank you very much, and have a great day.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's call is being recorded. With that being said, I'll turn the conference now to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. David Myers. Please go ahead.","David Myers","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our first quarter call. With me today are George Paz, our CEO; and Jeff Hall, our CFO.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements, may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. Company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our recent SEC filing.","For clarity purposes, all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables in our press release for reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we'll be discussing. And the reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our earnings release, which is posted on our website.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who'll discuss our first quarter results.","Jeffrey L. Hall","Thanks, David. On April 2, we completed the acquisition of Medco. In anticipation of closing, we maintained high levels of project spending to free up capacity for integration activities in the year and delayed cost savings opportunities, keeping staffing at higher levels to support integration planning. We also incurred additional expenses during the quarter to ensure a smooth transition for new clients and to accrue management bonuses which were not paid in 2011.","Despite this increased spending, gross profit was up 11%, gross profit margin was 7.1%, up slightly from 7% in the first quarter of 2011, EBITDA was up 7% over last year and EBITDA for adjusted Rx rose to $3.40, up 3%. First quarter earnings per share was $0.73, up 11% from prior year. Cash flow from operations was $530 million for the quarter, a 117% increase from $244 million last year.","Turning to guidance. We expect EPS for the year, excluding transaction, integration and amortization expenses, to be in a range of $3.36 to $3.66, representing growth of 18% over 2011 at the midpoint. Consistent with last year, EPS is more back-end-loaded due to timing of new generics, realization of synergies and client billings expected in the fourth quarter. Total adjusted claims are expected to be approximately $1.4 billion. Gross profit and gross profit margins are expected to improve sequentially as we move through the year. This guidance assumes that diluted shares outstanding will average 833 million for the next 3 quarters and total 750 million shares on a weighted average basis for 2012. This share count will be affected by the amount and timing of legacy Medco options and RSUs exercised. There are approximately 48 million outstanding, and we have assumed that about 1\/3 of these are exercised over the course of the year. Since we issued shares in the second quarter to complete this transaction, earnings per share for each quarter will not add up to earnings per share for the year. The tax rate assumed in our forecast is 39% for the year. If the share count or tax rate changes from our assumptions, our EPS forecast would most likely change. I would also like to take this opportunity to confirm that our view on synergy and accretion has not changed. We continue to expect the transaction to be slightly accretive in the first full year and moderately accretive once fully integrated. That means we expect to achieve $1 billion of synergy in 2014 and that the transaction will be moderately accretive to standalone 2014 earnings per share.","And with that, I'll turn it over to George.","George Paz","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. April 2 marked a truly defining moment in our history. After months of rigorous review, the FTC allowed our acquisition of Medco to proceed without any stipulation. This merger represents the next chapter of our mission to lower cost, drive outlays, improve adherence and deliver better health outcomes. Bringing our 2 companies together provides limitless opportunities to innovate and improve how health care is delivered. Our successful track record of acquisitions is based on a philosophy of taking the best in class of both organizations and combining them for the benefit of our clients, patients and stockholders. Building upon a platform of clinical expertise and applying our understanding of behavioral sciences, we have an unprecedented opportunity to improve patient outcomes, drive down the cost of prescription medications and eliminate the wasteful spending that burdens the pharmacy benefit. This will help us chart a course for continued growth with the creation of innovative solutions to address our country's most pressing health care challenges.","We are receiving great feedback from clients and prospects. Our breadth of services that span traditional PBM management, specialty management, Medicaid and Medicare is unmatched in the industry and positions us well for client retention and new sales opportunities. Just last month, I met with many of our clients at our annual Outcomes Conference, our first large event as a combined company. Overwhelmingly, our clients are supportive of our merger and share our enthusiasm about the enhanced services they will receive. Our clients also continue to voice strong support for our retail strategy. The conference highlighted our industry-leading Drug Trend Report, which provided cost -- cutting-edge solutions for most effectively managing a pharmacy benefit. This year, we focused on the $408 billion of waste due to suboptimal pharmacy-related behavior. Non-adherence contributes over $300 billion of this waste. This is enough to cover the cost of health care for nearly 45 million uninsured Americans. Our breakthrough adherence solution, ScreenRX, combines early detection with tailored interventions, improving outcomes and lowering cost. In the wake of our merger with Medco, ScreenRX is a prime example of where Express Scripts is headed, making it easier for patients to make decisions that improve their health and lower the cost of health care. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of medicine safer and more affordable. This is exactly what employers, health plans, unions and government agencies need now.","At this point, we'd be happy to answer any of your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, I just want to kind of get some of your preliminary comments on the selling season this year. It seems, based on your 1Q results, given your revenues and your claims growth, that it doesn't seem that the Walgreens issue is really having a big impact on your business. Maybe if you could comment on that and kind of give us some of your early perspectives on the selling season and how some of the conversations with some of the Medco renewals is going, it'd be helpful.","George Paz","Why don't we take a step backwards first and ask ourselves what is the job of a PBM? What are we hired to do at the end of the day? Our job is to take the waste out of this system. As I said in my prepared comments, there is billions and billions of dollars that are being wasted in the health care benefit. To the extent those dollars can be captured, we reduce the cost of health care, we improve health outcomes and, therefore, we deliver a better product. That is our job. So what are our clients looking for? They're looking to spend money where it matters and not spend money where it doesn't matter. So again, if a cutting-edge new cancer agent comes to market, very expensive, we put it on the formulary. We have to put it on the formulary. We want to put it on the formulary, because it's going to help our patients health outcomes improve. By the same token, those components of the health care system that only drive up cost and don't improve health outcomes, there's no place for that. Companies today are struggling in this economy.  With the uncertainty of our global economy, other things that are going on throughout our country and the rest of the world, companies can't afford to spend money on things that don't matter. Pharmacists are a very important element of the health care delivery system. To the extent that they're helping to improve individuals' health outcomes by focusing on adherence, the right drug at the right time, with proper direction, that's all very important things, and that's what we want to pay for. Merely dispensing the drug itself is not a value-added endeavor. So again, to the extent somebody want to charge more money for that activity, there's no room in the equation for that, quite frankly. Those clients that want it, that want to pay for it, that want to have -- that are willing to pay for that convenience factor, they may want to do it and they may go somewhere else. But, quite frankly, we're very content in doing what our clients are asking us to do, and that is to take out those unnecessary costs out of the equation. And that's our focus. That message is very well received. We believe we are well positioned, as you see, our script counts grew last year, unlike some people thought they would decline. We're very well positioned. I think at the end of the day, the question is going to be on our ability to continue to innovate and deliver quality products that take out waste. And that's our mission, so we're pretty excited about that, Glen.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe if I could just ask Jeff a follow-up. Jeff, I wanted to talk quickly about the expenses. If I look at the expenses recorded by Express Scripts on the SG&A side, probably a little bit higher than what we'd modeled, and you said you're continuing to pull some projects forward to free up some capacity for the integration. And secondly, I look at the expenses on the Medco side, what they reported, the gross margins and out-margins were both below what we had expected. So SG&A was well above kind of where we had it modeled. And so I'm wondering if you could just elaborate on the expenses a little bit in the first quarter, because it seems like on both Express Scripts and Medco, both the expenses were higher than what we had modeled. So if you just give us some comments on that, it'd be helpful.","Jeffrey L. Hall","Sure. I think what you said is accurate. Both companies continue to spend on projects in anticipation of the acquisition closing. So we did see expenses up. And in addition, we kept people around. We always ramp up for 1\/1, we kept those people around because now they're going to be working on integration-related activity, so that's extra cost in the quarter. I think what you'll see now as we add the 2 companies together, when we come out with Q2 -- obviously, now you're going to see combined Express Scripts\/Medco numbers rolled up into Express, so we'll see those numbers come up in Q2, and then you'll see that the numbers start to decline over time as we begin to realize the synergies from this transaction.","George Paz","Let me just add on to that. As we look out to the future, we don't know how the Supreme Court decision is ultimately going to come through. But we've got to be nimble. And I think one of the qualities of Express Scripts is that we've been able to move quickly and do things efficiently. But there's a lot that's going to take place in '13 and '14 as we prepare for health care reform as the Supreme Court either upholds the current health care law, or even if they keep most of it, maybe the individual mandate, if that gets turned down and the rest of it stays, we're still going to have to be prepared for the exchanges. So I think what Jeff's saying is right. We certainly had a lot of ramp cost. Medco didn't know till towards the end of the quarter that the deal was -- when the deal was actually going to close. They had to be prepared to continue to operate and compete on a standalone basis, so there was a lot of cost being incurred on their side as we also tried to get ready for integration and the combination of the companies. But we still have to spend money in order to make sure that we have the premier offerings in 2014. So that's also included in our guidance, but it's something that we have to be prepared for.","Operator","Our next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","George, just going back to the selling season for a minute. There have been some comments that the selling season is going to be to 2 to 3x what it's been historically because of your combination. Can you maybe just frame for us what you're seeing as far as what customers are doing in the Medco book? Are they utilizing the change of control, or are you seeing this more of a status quo here, and therefore, we're just going to see us going through more of a normalized selling season for your book and the Medco book?","George Paz","Well, I think any time you do an acquisition, if you remember back -- good morning, by the way, Lisa -- but as we look out, we look in the past and see our previous acquisitions. Remember, when we were -- after we closed the WellPoint transaction, our sales activity wasn't as robust as historical, because, again, people are a little less likely to want to look at you when you're in the middle of a transitional issue. Our job is to make sure that they feel comfortable with that, and that's what our sales people are engaged to do. But with the SXC-Catalyst merger, there's a lot more activity taking place this year on multiple fronts. So it's still too early. Remember, keep in mind, we've only been 5 weeks into this transaction. I know there's been a tremendous amount of misinformation given out there.  Some people seem to think or seem to believe they know more about this business than we do, even though we own it. So there's very few contracts that actually have change-of-control provisions in them. But we're going through our process, and I don't want to get into specific client conversations. We usually aim to keep 95% of our business, for good reason. We think we had to continue to grow profits, and at times, our model doesn't necessarily always fit with the clients we have. We've never had a 100% share.  By definition, we will lose some clients over the course of the year, and we'll gain others. And as the year unfolds and we get our arms better around the Medco situation, we'll be able to give much better guidance. We're just very early on into this process. Medco is big. We had our annual Outcomes Conference a couple of weeks ago.  Medco's is next week, so we're headed down for that, and we'll get a better read then. But we feel very good about what we've seen.  We've been in front of -- I personally have been in front of many, many of the Medco clients, and I think they're excited about what we have to offer.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","George, going back but [indiscernible] reported in your Outcomes Conference, I think you talked about this new narrow network that will be tiered. Can you just maybe talk about how that works?  Is that an incremental savings for the member?  Or is it tiered based on what the plan sponsor will play? And then secondly, what's been the early reception to this kind of tiering program?","George Paz","We've just rolled it out. There a tremendous amount of interest. I think eliminating Walgreens from our network was better received, quite frankly, than even we expected, and the clients had virtually no disruption. So this was a very big home run for us, and I think that opened up the flood gates. And I think what we're seeing is opportunities for employers to form special networks that are centered around their employee bases. So if you've got 5,000 employees, you really need a 60,000-store network.  And why not take advantage of concentrating all your employees into a given set of stores that are large in your area.  You can protect it with a wrap, with a national network while are traveling, so they can still get it. It is a savings to the member, and it's also a saving to the plan sponsor. Keep in mind that we don't -- the plan sponsor is the one that ultimately controls the cost, so we tell them what the cost differentials are and what the options are. And so as we do that, we can then evaluate the differences of cost versus access, and then the plan sponsor can decide how much copay differential they want to allow the member to go to the premier stores and with that means for the plan sponsor.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Great. And then if I could squeeze one more with Jeff.  When we look at this script volume in the quarter, Jeff, 3.6%, clearly better than that guidance that you gave of 0% to 2%. Should be still be thinking overall year being 0% to 2%? I think you gave a guidance number now, right, of 1.4 million claims?  But what's the underlying utilization expectations, I guess, for that book of business when we think about what you did in the first quarter? And secondly, what was the primary driver of it coming in obviously materially better than what you expected?","Jeffrey L. Hall","So utilization still remains very low. Basically, we aren't seeing any, it's functionally flat. So all of the increase we saw was a result of net new business that we won over the course of the middle to end of last year, and that's what's driving the increase. As we move through the year, we did have a new client that came on in the September time frame, so we would expect to lap the compares on that towards the end of the year. But we remain very positive about the core or the legacy Express Scripts numbers.  The volume is just there, we're seeing nice net new growth, and that's without any kind of utilization.","Operator","Our next question is from the line of Bob Willoughby of Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","George, when you guys did the DPS deal years ago, you threw out a number of the business that DPS did that you were targeting to retain. It was something in the neighborhood of a 90% number. Wouldn't you be better served or well served to kind of throw that kind of number out for the Medco book of business, what you expect to retain? Because, clearly, there's some work there, that they're doing, that probably doesn't meet your profit standards.","George Paz","That's a good comment. Back in those days, we didn't have nearly as good a CFO as we have today. So we're trying to struggle with how to get our arms around that, Bob. But, yes, that's a great point. But keep in mind the difference.  Back in those days we were both relatively -- or much smaller PBMs relative to what we have today. So our due diligence work going into that acquisition was, quite frankly, a lot more thorough, because we could. This deal was in front of the FTC for an extended period of time, and our access to information was pretty limited. You're exactly right, though. There's clients that we have a way of doing things, and our business model has a certain manner. And some clients, that's not going to be right for. And other clients, it'll be good for. And the synergies will help us stay -- even become more competitive. So you're right. There is a number out there, and we should do that. I can't tell you I know what that is today. We're very early on here relative to where we stood with DPS. But that's a great point, and we'll definitely take it under advisement.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","All right. That might be interesting to hear next call, then, possibly, before we start seeing business siphoned away.","George Paz","Bob, by the way, we did include in the synergy number a fairly uneducated, if you will, guess on loss of some clients. So that is -- the $1 billion is a net number. We'll try to get that better refined, though, as we get a chance to go through all the contracts.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And obviously, you mentioned no plans for the Medco pharmacy networks here. A, would you hazard -- do you have anything to say on that front?  Or, B, if you do intend to make some changes, when do you actually need to notify clients?","George Paz","Well, it depends. I've met with a whole host of clients not too long ago, maybe 2, 3 weeks ago, and kind of explained to them the cost differentials by including Walgreens. There's some misnomers out there that -- somebody who runs a pharmacy chain up in Chicago is saying that $1 or $2 doesn't matter when it's only 20% of your total network. Well, it matters a lot. Because what that does is it sets a pricing level. And again, when you're paying one person a premium over others, you're, of course, putting price pressure on the entire network. So even if it's a few cents, it all matters. It's all relative to the value you're delivering. And I think that there's -- again, there's a pay-for-performance standard. If we can come up with ways to help actually drive down costs, improve adherence, do things that are out of the ordinary course of the book, we're willing to pay for those if our clients are willing to pay for those. But we're not just willing to pay for doing nothing special, for not doing anything different. So when we go out to the Medco clients, the Medco clients themselves as we're going through this process -- and again, we're very early on, here -- several of them have already selectively chosen to drop Walgreens themselves. That'll be occurring here shortly. And that's their decision. When that occurs, there doesn't have to be any notice, they just do it. If we were to decide to drop them, that would require notice, and we have to go through a process. We're still evaluating all that.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And then just the last one. Just, any plans, any insights yet on the mail footprint, what you will consolidate, what you will keep?","George Paz","We are going through that. As you probably know, that's a pretty -- those are tough calculations. There's everything from state tax credits to job credits to labor relations to supply a pharmacist, and those are big decisions. We are pretty far down that path, Bob. We've incorporated some of that into our guidance, but we still have a little bit of room to go there. But we are -- those things have to be done quickly. The employees need to know where we're headed. So rationalizing the footprint is an incredibly important part of our process. Pat McNamee and his team, led by David Norton, all play a very prominent role in this process, and we're pretty far down that path, and we'll continue to advance that ball.","Operator","Our next question is from Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Now I'm wondering whatever happened to that CFO. I think I'm talking to him. He did okay. Just to elaborate a little bit, George, on a point. We met with, recently, the CEO of a health plan who suggests that while they're still using Walgreens they'll be very willing to have a conversation with you guys about saving money. So I guess that's consistent with what you've said. And you said that, for the time being, they remain in Medco's network. You're communicating that -- you're evaluating sort of your decision for 2013. Is there any way to sort of frame, if you were to make a decision about or go forward without one chain, would that be September, October?  Or might we hear something before that?","George Paz","Larry, I don't want to speculate on that at this time. Again, because of our FTC process, Chris Houston and her team have been out running our supply-chain economics and putting the contracts side-by-side and understanding best practices and what opportunities we have. And this is still a little too early to go there, but we'll definitely keep you posted.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. And then just a quick -- as well as that and a quick follow-up for Jeff. On Medicare Part D, I guess, the same question. Obviously, you're growing your Part D business.  Medco had a five-star rated product. Is it still too early to sort of think about combined strategy, or are you going to be rolling something out?","Jeffrey L. Hall","I'll enter even a little broader than that. Certainly, Med D is a growth area, and Medco had a great product there, so we're taking a good hard look at that in deciding what we want to do. But that applies to, really, all of the subsidiaries as well, right? We've inherited a bunch. We have some, and we're going through really detailed process right now to figure out what makes sense and what we want to continue and what we want to focus on and grow over the course of the next several years.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great. And just a quick follow-up, then. You're guiding at a midpoint to 18% growth, and it seems like your history, the performance to that midpoint has been outstanding, notwithstanding issues last year. Just remind us again, I know you get a tax rate and a share count, but it seems like it's a pretty wide range of $0.30, Jeff.  And I know you're not talking about next year, but are there any major headwinds and tailwinds we should think about as we kind of think about growth for next year?","George Paz","Jump in on that, and then Jeff can also add in. Again, because we had limited opportunity to plow through all the things we normally do, that's why we have a wide range. We are hopeful that we can do synergy acquisition faster, and that could drive us to the higher end of the range. But also there's a lot of cost here. We'd also have a lot of Medicare, Medicaid and exchange uncertainties that are facing us, and that's what drives us to the lower end of the range. So we've got a lot of work to do, and I think it's only prudent at this early stage to give a wide range. As we go through the year and we get our network strategy better finalized and understand the different options that we have -- and your point on Medicare is right on. Medicare is a fast-growing area. We are incredibly excited that we brought in Tim Wentworth and Glen Stettin from the Medco team to be part of my senior management team. And Tim heads up all of the account management and sales programs, and he's an ex-Medco guy, so you probably know him. And he's a wonderful addition to our team, and he's very much focused on growing the business on a profitable basis. So he's going to help us rationalize the Medco business with our business and figure out what's in our best interest and our clients' best interest and our patients' best interest. And at the same time, Glen is going to run our product portfolio for us, and so, looking at Medicare and Medicaid, the exchanges and all the options, he's very well equipped. He's a doctor by education, so he's very well equipped to come to the table and help us get the right offering. So we're very excited with where we sit.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And headwinds and tailwinds for '13, or is it too early to comment, George?","George Paz","Well, I think that's what I'm speaking to. The headwinds are really the uncertainty of the future right now. And there's always challenges. We're taking 2 systems and putting them together, we're going to start that process, we don't lollygag when it comes to this stuff. We think the best thing we can do is get to one platform rather quickly. I think that eliminates a tremendous amount of cost, it allows us to remain flexible, it gives us a standard offering across all of our books of business, investments that we are fixated and focused on. But there's always surprises when you start peeling those things back, and those are the headwinds. The tailwinds are a pretty powerful. We've got a tremendous synergy opportunity. Jeff talked about the $1 billion, and the timing of that gives us great tailwinds, and we've got a great product offering portfolio. We're taking our clinical, our combined clinical expertises combined with our understanding of behavioral economics is, I think, is just something that's unprecedented in our industry and something the entire country is thirsting for. So we're well positioned.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","You showed very growth in your mail script account. Can you talk through what's driving the growth? And is the shift away from Walgreens helping in transitioning some members away from retail and toward mail?","George Paz","We are thankful on that one a little bit, again, to our friends up north. When they decided to withdraw from our network, that gave us a reason to outreach to all of our members on behalf of our client. And they had an option. They could either go to other retail drugstores or they could look at the convenience and efficiency and cost savings attributable to home delivery, so it helped drive home delivery up.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then following up on Larry's question around kind of growth rate in the future. And understanding kind of like the timing of integration and it takes time to transition to one system. But really, when we think about the opportunities over the next 2 to 3 years as the integration are completed, can we use that kind of like midpoint of this year figure of around 18% as our benchmark?","George Paz","You really think I'm going to answer that question? I mean, we have not given '13 or '14 guidance, and we don't intend to do that at this time. We're a couple of weeks into this acquisition, and we got a lot of work ahead of us. We're excited about where we sit. But keep in mind, there's a tremendous amount of uncertainty in our marketplace. We don't know how the Supreme Court is going to rule. I will tell you it was a travesty for so long that so many Americans did not have accessibility to our health care system. That had to change. It's changed now. Everybody is in '14 is going to get access, but we haven't addressed the cost side. The cost side alone is, both to the state and the federal government, could be huge.  It will be huge. And we're going to have to address those issues. All those -- addressing of all those issues means significant changes to what we do today and how that's going to play out in the future. To the extent that we are nimble, that we are part of the solution, there is tremendous opportunity for us in the future. By the same token, though, we don't know how that's going to play out, so we just have to be positioned and ready, and we will keep you informed and give guidance as we go.","Operator","Our next question is from Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I have a couple of follow-ups. George, I think you were talking before -- you maybe alluded to $1 or $2 a script is meaningful to clients. I know it varies by situation, but can you talk about average differences you're seeing for clients, either with and without Walgreens? And also, maybe as a result of your new advantage offering network?","George Paz","I don't want to get into the particulars, and again, you're right. I mean, it really depends. It depends on the mix of business and whether or not -- if you've got high utilizers of specialty drug, you're going to have a much different answer than if you've got a young population, if you're a professional firm which turns over young people rather frequently with a high density of young people, that's going to be a different answer. So I think every client is different, and so that's why one size doesn't fit all, and a PBM has to have the tools to be able to go out and evaluate that. I will tell you, though, some companies are very agnostic of regarding their offerings, and they've got -- we saw clients with two-tier products with almost no differential in price between the first and second tier with very open formularies and open access standards. And that's not our sweet spot. And those clients don't really -- we have a hard time providing much of a value to them, because we're not taking cost out of the equation. We're not actually improving their health outcomes. Our tools don't work as well there. So it's just depends on the situation. But again, from our perspective, we look at every drug on our formulary. We look at every access point in our network.  And we look at every dollar we spend. I think any company that's well run looks at every penny it spends and determines whether or not that penny is adding value to its shareholders. If it is, you spend it. If it isn't, why spend it? There's too many great opportunity to save jobs, to grow companies, to improve margins. You don't spend money for nothing, and I think that's the message we have to our clients. Our clients, it resonates with, and it is proving fair dividend for us.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So it sounds like your thinking is there is savings, and whatever the amount, it's important.","George Paz","There are savings, and then for some clients, it's quite large. Other clients, it's not nearly as large just because of the demographics I talked about a minute ago.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right. You mentioned before, sort of evaluating the situation with Medco and Walgreens and the network. Clearly, you still have an option now. Based on the current contract, though, between Medco and Walgreens, how long is that an option to keep Walgreens in the network, even?","George Paz","I tell you, we'll keep you posted as we go. I really don't want to discuss either drugs, networks, clients or any of that in an open forum. It's really our business with our clients and their decisions on how to meet the health care of their patients. And I know it's important to all of you, but quite frankly, it's very important to our clients and our clients shouldn't be hearing stuff here. We should be working with them to meet their needs, and we will keep you posted on those decisions as they unfold.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Last one, if I could. On the integration, Jeff, I think you mentioned your synergy and your accretion expectations haven't changed. You were a little bit more detailed on the timing, I think, so I just wanted to make sure is there any changes in your views there? And can you remind us if there's any key steps or milestones that we can sort of watch for as you proceed on the integration?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Yes, absolutely no change. We tried to be a little bit more precise because now we actually have a closing date. Originally, we've been saying first full year post-close, one fully integrated, we've been saying the integration is 18 to 24 months. So now that we actually have a hard closing date of April 2, we can fill in the dates and fill in the time frames, which is why I was a little more precise today, saying we still expect it to be slightly accretive first full year and moderately accretive once fully integrated. And now I can say that what that means is that we expect $1 billion of synergy to be in '14 as $1 billion and moderately accretive to standalone would have been EPS for '14.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Any key milestone that we should think about in terms of the process as you move forward?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Yes, I would tell you there are pages and pages of key milestones, probably none of which we're going to share externally. I think we'll give you updates on our quarterly calls. But, quite frankly, it's probably going to be hard for investors to see externally, other than what we're saying.","George Paz","The key to both the synergies and to positioning ourselves is getting the systems integrated. That's always the biggest thing, and that's comes in waves and over time, and we'll keep you all posted on how that's proceeding.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just a follow-on to the synergy question. It looks like, obviously, the total amount is unchanged. I know you've had a whole month to look under the hood. Any more perspective you can add on the sources of synergies? I know the systems you mentioned being a big part of it, but maybe just any more color of SG&A versus COGS?","George Paz","I don't think we've broken down sources.","Jeffrey L. Hall","Yes, we have not.","George Paz","No, but it's going to be from a combination of things. To the extent that Medco ran multiple formularies, we were more tighter around our formularies. We had to look at all that and see what is it clients are trying to accomplish and can we rein some of those in?  That'll give us upside to the synergies. And so we've got a lot of work there, but part of the synergies will come from supply chain. Some of it will come from just getting the footprint right-sized. And then I think we bring a different approach to things. If you look at a lot of the acquisitions that Medco did over in the past and a lot of their spend, I'm not sure they used the same rigor and discipline that Express Scripts uses in how we set rate of return targets and the thresholds we're looking for. I think it's all about focus at the end of the day, and we've never lost our focus on our patients and our clients. And that is to improve the health care system by driving out cost and improving health outcomes.  And everything's got to tie back to that, one way or another. Otherwise, it's really not in our bailiwick. So that's where we will continue to work.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And just If I could follow on the tax, Jeff, understanding that it is your best estimate. At this point, I mean, can you maybe help us bridge the gap between your legacy rate, Medco's rate and the 39% that you provided? At this point, are there known items that maybe fall away in future periods?","Jeffrey L. Hall","No, it's just really early, and tax rate, it takes a while. We are, as you might imagine with a 39% tax rate, paying a full federal rate. And so what it comes down to is how do we -- what tax rates do we have state by state?  And there's just a lot of work going into what the final footprint is going to be, how we're going to interact, how all that's going to be apportioned. So it really is early. What we've done is we've taken a look at our tax rates and our apportionment and Medco's and said that it probably is going to end up in the center somewhere. We used 39% for our guidance, and we're trying to be real transparent from that standpoint, saying, look, in my 351 midpoint, we used the 39% tax rate.  To the extent the actual tax rate comes in different than that, that 351 midpoint is going probably to move.","George Paz","Can we just do one more question, please?","Operator","That'll be from the line of Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Congrats on the strength of some of the key metrics in the quarter. And I guess speaking to that, just curious on the first quarter gross profit strength. Two questions kind of interrelated. I guess to the extent that your cost of revenues no longer included a certain potentially higher-cost retail pharmacy provider, was that exclusion material enough to move the needle in the quarter?  Or was it more a function of maybe you were able to get lower reimbursement rates to stick with all the other retailers of the pharmacy network? Just trying to get more color around the gross profit strength.","Jeffrey L. Hall","Yes. So the exclusion of the person you're talking about had no impact at all, on the gross margin in the quarter, no meaningful impact. Really, the strength is about the generic fill rate being up and mail being up, and it's in line with our model of alignment. We talk about it a lot.  As we're able to save cost for our clients, our profitability tends to improve. And we saw a large increase in generics and we saw a nice increase in mail that we talked about earlier. Holding it back a little bit has been LIPITOR.  Obviously, it's one of the big generics, and the pricing of generic LIPITOR just hasn't come down dramatically yet. On top of that, it's the additional spending on projects that we talked about, some of that's above the line. And then the 1\/1, the headcount that I said is remaining on to now start working on integration. But network, no meaningful impact.","George Paz","Just to add on to that a little bit. When we talked about the Walgreens situation, it wasn't that we would come out of the chute. They wanted to hold their rates based on what they were in 2011 for the next 3 years. And as you know, branded drugs rise at 11% a year, and specialty drugs go up at over 14% a year. So we're one month into this. So the impact on this year's expense levels, cost of goods sold levels, isn't that great. It's what happens over a 3-year compounding of drug cost rising at over 10% for really doing nothing different than putting the same pills to the same bottle. That's what was intolerable, that's what caused the problem. And it was that and then the redefinition of generics to increase the price, effectively, for generics. Those items, if we would have taken them on, you would have seen our cost of goods sold rising at a much higher rate over time. None of that's really in the first quarter, just to make sure we're clear.","David Myers","Okay, well, again, thank you all very much for your time this morning. We're very excited about what this acquisition means to us, our patients and our clients and our shareholders. So thank you very much, and we'll keep you posted as we move down the integration path. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8761":["Express Scripts Holding Co.

The press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.express-scripts.com.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Today we're going to focus on the results for the strong financial quarter and share our excitement about the future of our business and our industry. Our business model of alignment, standing strong with our clients, is translating to another strong retention year, sales year, as well as a great year overall.","So first I want to discuss a top issue in our country, escalating drug prices. There is no doubt that drugs represent the first line of defense and hope for taking on the vast majority of medical conditions. However, our nation's attention has increasingly turn to affordability of drugs, particularly in cases where new and existing products lack competition. Gross prices for many existing therapies have increased at rates higher than other areas of healthcare. This has not only captured the attention of payers and patients, but also politicians in this election year.","A few pharma companies have chosen to blame our industry for these rising drug prices. This is ironic, as the facts accumulated over many years with real results could not be more supportive of our role in creating affordable access to drugs. Just this week, a new report noted that although drug pricing will remain in the headlines, solving the challenge involves use of PBM tools, tools which include value-based purchasing, PBM negotiating leverage, increased competition through more FDA approvals, and protecting the Medicare Part D program, which has been immensely popular and has come in under budget every year because of the use of our tools.","Additionally, two recent reports further validate the systematic need for what we do and, importantly, what we have done. First, IMS released a detailed study concluding that the current price in the United States for a hepatitis C cure is below that of nearly every Western European country. We were proud to lead the way. Second, The New England Journal of Medicine released a study on the effect of co-pay coupons on cost and generic utilization. Unsurprisingly, they concluded that these coupons are, and I quote, \"undermining insurer copayment systems,\" and that they result in significant increase in cost due to unnecessary use of branded drugs over equivalent generics. When we saw these coupons proliferating, we changed our formulary strategy, we drove costs down, and we protected our clients. These studies add to a robust dossier of research from academic and government agencies that collectively validate the power of PBM solutions.","The bottom line is that drug companies set drug prices. Our job is to get the lowest net cost and to put medicine within reach of patients. And let me be clear: We do our job very well, and our job has never been more important. The proof of what we do, the results we achieve for our clients, shine through the headlines and the rhetoric. Last quarter, we highlighted our 2015 drug trend, which you see on the left side of the slide. Given all the discussions in 2016 about drug pricing, we wanted to present a year-to-date drug trend figure. Through the first nine months, our commercial clients' average drug trend is 3.9%; 3.9%. This is against 5.2% for our average client in 2015 and, importantly, is inclusive of specialty spend and the positive effect of our adherence programs.","By driving greater generic utilization, more competition between clinically equivalent medicines, use of low-cost channels, while achieving higher patient adherence and better medical outcomes, we leverage our unique collection of strengths in ways no one else can. And we believe there's even more we can do to expand the potential of our model, applying our unique supply chain expertise and focused clinical approach to generate client savings and drive growth for our business.","In fact, look no further than SafeguardRx. In the past several weeks, we've bolstered this offering with novel solutions for inflammatory conditions and diabetes. In addition, for 1\/1, we will introduce a market events program that will provide proactive protection to clients from the challenging drug price environment.","Our business model provides a differentiated opportunity to manufacturers that want to bring innovative drugs to market in the safest and most cost-effective way. The discussions we have with manufacturers are focused on ensuring broad access, the best possible overall outcomes, and cost management, while limiting the disruption and delivering greater savings to clients year over year. It's exactly where we want to be as a company: actively engaged, bringing our innovative solutions to the marketplace to add more value to the pharmacy benefit as we better serve patients and clients.","The common thread through all of these programs is our unique, focused ability to leverage deep, specialized expertise in clinical care, supply-chain management, and client alignment. That's what SafeguardRx and our other solutions are delivering: innovation that drives down healthcare costs and improves outcomes. The proof of our model is in our financial performance, and now I'll turn it over to Eric to share our third quarter results.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the third quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.74, representing growth of 20% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. On a GAAP basis, we reported net income of $722.9 million, representing growth of 9% over last year and earnings per diluted share of $1.15, representing growth of 19% over last year.","Other third quarter highlights include adjusted claims of approximately $312 million were slightly below the midpoint of our guidance range. The largest driver of the volume impact is due to Coventry lives rolling off at a rate faster than expected, which impacted both retail and mail claims. Other factors include an increase in retail 90-day claims, as these are currently only counted as a single claim using our current adjustment methodology. And finally utilization management programs are curbing the use of controlled substances. Obviously, while utilization programs have an expected negative impact on our adjusted claims volume, we are proud of the fact that, working with physicians and plan sponsors, we are helping to curb this public health epidemic.","Adjusted SG&A decreased by 15% year over year. As discussed throughout this year, we remain firmly committed to expense management. As mentioned in prior quarters, we had one-time charges realized in the first half of 2016 that did not repeat, helping to reduce third quarter selling, general, and administrative expenses. We're also seeing lower depreciation and amortization as a result of assets becoming fully depreciated in July. Finally, with lower volumes, incentive compensation was lower during the quarter.","In the third quarter, we also generated $1.9 billion of EBITDA, resulting in EBITDA per adjusted Rx of $6.24, representing growth of 13% year-over-year despite the headwind of both the Coventry and Catamaran business rolling off our books on 1\/1\/2016, which we'll discuss further on our next slide. In addition, we delivered strong operating cash flow of approximately $1.5 billion during the quarter and settled the 2016 accelerated share repurchase program, receiving 6.2 million additional shares.","Now to our 2016 guidance. With one quarter remaining, we are narrowing our guidance to an adjusted earnings per diluted share range of $6.36 to $6.42. This range raises the midpoint to $6.39 and represents growth of 15% to 16% year over year. There are a few other guidance revisions I also want to discuss. We are decreasing the midpoint of our adjusted SG&A range by $10 million, which represents a decrease of approximately 6% year over year at the midpoint. As a leadership team, we are very pleased with the work our teams have done in the past year with regard to expense management, driving towards being a cost leader in our industry. The 2016 guidance does imply that adjusted SG&A will increase in the fourth quarter. This upward trend is to prepare for a strong 1\/1 implementation and to invest in innovative offerings to our clients, such as continuing to build on our SafeguardRx programs.","We're also decreasing the midpoint of our EBITDA range by $50 million, which represents growth of approximately 3% year over year at the midpoint. Going into 2016, we were faced with two large headwinds due to acquisitions, with both the Coventry and Catamaran businesses rolling off our books. The Catamaran drug formulary management business is coming in below forecast due to an accelerated roll-off. Also, as I indicated earlier, our volume is being impacted by a greater- and faster-than-expected roll-off of the Coventry lives, and the volume impact now represents a 4% loss of adjusted claims.","Despite these challenges, we were successful at retaining our clients and taking on new business in 2016 to overcome the headwinds and grow EBITDA by 3%. The growth came from leveraging our key growth drivers: supply-chain management, specialty, and mail, all fueled by the adoption of our cost savings tools by our clients. Specific to supply-chain management, we are realizing growth due to cost savings from generics, including both branded drugs coming off patent, as well as the lower cost of generics procured through our GPO for our home delivery pharmacy business.","We are also seeing an increase driven by greater adoption of our clinical tools. As shown in the table, our total adjusted claims midpoint remained relatively consistent with the prior guidance despite the increase in Coventry claims rolling off. Bottom line is that our core business is performing despite the headwinds we have faced throughout the year.","Finally, due to our deployment of cash, we expect share repurchases in the fourth quarter of between $750 million to $1 billion. The impact of our share repurchase program more than offsets the forecasted reduction in our EBITDA range, resulting in a $0.01 increase at the midpoint of our EPS range. Therefore, we expect fourth quarter adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.84 to $1.90. Finally, in regards to the 2017 outlook, we plan to release our 2017 guidance before the market opens on December 14.","I will now turn it back over to Tim for some closing comments.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thanks, Eric. A year ago, I said there was never a better time to be in our business, given market needs. That is more true today than ever. In the 18 years I've been in this business, value creation has expanded from mail service and rebates to generics to specialty and now indication and outcomes-based pricing. The point is we have always created and delivered value to payers and patients. It's why we exist. To deliver meaningful long-term value in today's marketplace, it takes specialized care and unique, sometimes challenging, relationships with manufacturers and retailers, along with a willingness to take bold actions to drive greater efficiencies. In short, it takes Express Scripts.","We have transformed the supply chain. Pharma comes to us to partner on value-based approaches, proactively tying reimbursement to performance. As I mentioned earlier, just this past month, we announced two clinically-based solutions in inflammatory conditions in diabetes and also a retail pharmacy change with one of our largest clients, moving market share to deliver major savings with minimal disruption. We are an aligned, focused market force that improves healthcare while driving down costs. We're respected and rewarded for our bold actions by those who follow our industry and by those who need the value we offer, our clients.","This year, we expect retention to be between 97% and 98%, near an all-time high. In addition to our high client retention, we are pleased with this year's new sales results with new-name sales exceeding our client retention losses excluding Coventry. That's validation of our business model of alignment, appreciation of our innovative solutions, and recognition from our clients that with Express Scripts as their PBM they are more likely to achieve their goals, and we are more likely to achieve our goals today and into the future.","Now we'll be happy to take your questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. You may now ask your question.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Tim, just to follow up on your thoughts around the selling season for 2017, when we get to December 14, will you actually give a net new number? What's the metric that we should think about? Is it just going to be scripts, or do we think about it the way Medco used to do it and it grows versus net basis as far as what you keep?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Good morning, Lisa, and thanks for the question. Well, first of all, we will most certainly give you claims guidance at that point. And we are having some discussions right now about the most appropriate set of metrics to give you that day in addition to what we normally give you. We recognize that, as we've said, our core is performing well and we want that to show through in terms of the guidance that we give. And so let us get back to you on that, but I understand. As I said in my color today, we're really pleased to have our sales exceeding our named losses, and meaningfully. And so, from that standpoint, we recognize it would be \u2013 any additional color would be helpful.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then just secondly, your comments around relationships with the pharmaceutical manufacturers, we hear lots of things in the market, whether it's moving to a net price, less drug price inflation. Can you talk about from your perspective any changes that you think could come about to the industry and what that would mean specifically to Express Scripts?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I think change has typically here \u2013 as we've seen it in the last year or two \u2013 been aligned around being able to demonstrate performance to manufacturers that also was performance the clients and patients needed. And I think we will continue to see a lot of the major pharma companies wanting to work with us to continue to add that level of precision to sort of how their drugs are given access to in our formularies.","But I don't expect to see change overnight. I think you're going to continue to see brands competing with each other for access to formularies, and the way that they're going to do that is to continue to retroactively discount through rebates. But I do \u2013 I like very much the fact that even in some places difficult to manage as oncology, we now have three different classes where we're working with manufacturers to get our clients more precision in terms of either how the drugs are reimbursed or getting their money back if patients drop off of therapy and those sorts of things. And I will tell you that the number of pharma companies that want those sorts of conversations with us is increasing, not decreasing.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","I think really what I was trying to better understand, though, is if the drug companies were taking 10% or 12% for price inflation, if that goes to 5% or 6%, or if some companies say, hey, look, you know what, we want to move more towards a net price than rebating, are you having those conversations, number one? And, number two, just to better understand how each of those things impact the model. And I'll stop there.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","You know, we are having some of those conversations, and what I would tell you is if you look over the long term, we figure out how to drive down costs for our clients and get paid for that. And so we don't see a dramatic shift away from the current rebate model. We do see decreasing inflation rates; there's no question about that. And, again, from our standpoint \u2013 again, in my 18 years, I've seen us as an industry do really well with zero inflation, I've seen us do really well with 10%, 12% inflation. In either case, we have to demonstrate to our clients that we're bringing value to the table. And I believe we're in a position to continue to do that. I think you're going to see some moderation of inflation, but probably not enough, frankly, for the payers' taste on a gross basis. Which is why we will still have a job to do to drive their net trends into the direction we've been able to achieve.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Tim and Eric, quick one. Just what are the variables at this point for 2017? You've got a pretty good bead on the margin trends; you know your debt schedules and where that share base is. With that clarity on the margin you offered today, what's left open-ended here for you?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah, I'll let Eric take that one.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, certainly we've launched the new Safeguard programs; we're going through enrollments with our clients on those programs. Those will be the biggest drivers. Also there's a series of drugs that are scheduled to come off brand next year. A lot of things will depend on timing of those. We continue to, through our GPO, continue to source and improve the sourcing of generics, so there'll be opportunity there. So those are kind of the larger of the still kind of unknowns and things that will have positive impact potentially on our numbers.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","What are you expecting for the exchanges, though? Or how well-positioned are you there?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, currently, from an exchange perspective, we're waiting on a lot of our health plans to determine where those lives are at and what the expected enrollments are. But at this point it's still too early to know how that is going to come out for 2017.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","As you can appreciate, Robert, there are a couple variables as it relates to that. There's, are the plans going to stay in are not \u2013 that we have good visibility to. Then it goes to how are their premium increases going to stack up against their competitors in the market, which could drive movement of lives one way or the other, and that's much more difficult to predict. We're modeling it out based on what we are aware of. We work very closely with the plans that are in the marketplace. But this year, I can tell you, for example, was a modest headwind for us that we don't call out. But we thought we got it right, and what you saw was there's a fairly price-sensitive group of buyers out there who will either be willing to risk paying the penalty or just drop out or switch providers away from us. So we don't think it's a major issue, but we need to see it play out.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher of Barclays. You may now ask your question.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Question on the SafeguardRx programs and maybe how they're running through the financial model. I know that you talked about in the first half you saw SG&A incentives to really drive those programs through. Is that something we should expect to see occur each year, or was that unique to this year? And then as we get into the back half, you've stated that brand inflation cap programs begin to contribute more in the second half of the year. Is that different than the type of contributions you expect in diabetes and inflammatory and the other programs? So how should we think about seasonality that we've seen to date and how that might change in the future?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah, so I'll start. The incentive compensation is certainly unique to this year. As you can imagine, launching something as comprehensive and large as our Safeguard program was a company-wide effort. I mean, it required everyone across the business to put it together, to execute at the negotiated arrangements that sat under it, and then to go out and model for clients. I mean, I would tell you that for example in the Diabetes Care Value Program, we are at the client level putting caps on their diabetes spend next year. And so that's individual \u2013 literally individual underwriting and so forth. So, when you look at that, those incentives were important to get things off the ground. That will not be a recurring theme, however.","And as it relates to sort of how it plays through in the numbers and seasonality-wise, I'll let Eric take that.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah. So as we've talked about before, I mean, the Inflation Protection Program this year as it relates to inflation and where inflation ultimately comes out naturally is back-loaded versus front-loaded. There's a more normal pattern in the rest of the programs, so we would expect other inflation protection to be fairly moderated throughout the year.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And is your expectation that going forward that inflation program provides less benefit, given Tim's comments earlier around we're not seeing the end of inflation but we may be seeing a little bit less, that \u2013 offset by the uptake of new programs? And maybe I'll just throw on there, what does success look like for these programs? Is the goal 5 million, 15 million, 50 million lives? What are you shooting for?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, I'll talk first about the outlook and as it impacts 2017. I would say stay tuned till December, and we'll talk about what the enrollment has looked like. Again, as I indicated earlier, it's early in the programs, and we'll wait until December really to comment on anything on outlook on 2017 on any of these programs.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah. And I guess all I'd add is that inflation is something that, while it's our job to tame it, we look really good to our clients when we can keep it low. And so from our standpoint, when it's driving retention, driving uptake of our programs, because clients see that those programs actually work, they see that it powers us with pharma to continue to move forward into negotiations that provide additional value. It's important for us to have the inflation caps. They are put in there to deter inflation. When they work, everybody wins. And, from our perspective, there's still competition to be on formulary, there's still competition to have access to our patients that occur even in low inflation. And so from that standpoint, I wouldn't say that the way to think about it is lower inflation dramatically changes our financial profile.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. You may now ask your question.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions. Eric, you mention operational improvements driving the impressive reduction in SG&A we saw in the quarter. Pretty significant and sudden reduction in spend there. So I was hoping you could maybe help us understand kind of how and where you were able to reduce the cost base so quickly. And then how should we think about \u2013 I know you talked about the uptick in 4Q \u2013 but how should we think about the sustainability of these savings as a run rate as we move out of 2016?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah, sure. Thanks for the question. So as we've talked on our previous quarters, we've been very focused across the business from an operating perspective in being much more efficient in both our fulfillment process and our call centers. We have taken on pretty significant initiatives to both improve the quality and functionality of our website and to continue to develop digital tools that our patients can go to. So that's their first line of resource to contact us. And as a result of that, we've seen a significant number of calls come out of our call centers, which is our goal, and we will continue to focus on that for 2017 through additional initiatives. So that's been the big driver. But also, just from an overall SG&A perspective, department by department, we've gone through and have been very, very focused on being efficient, productive, and taking out non-value-add work across our business. So you're seeing a lot of benefit of that coming to fruition, as we expected in the second half of the year.","I'll just point out also that there were two \u2013 a couple items in the first two quarters that were one-time items that drove higher numbers, so you're seeing a little more drop as a result of that. And also, as I commented in my script, volumes were off a little bit. We have internal and stretch incentive programs that \u2013 some of those weren't met in the quarter. So incentive compensation is lower. Fully expect folks to hit those in the fourth quarter, so I expect that to be up, but more so the fourth quarter driver is we have a lot of 1\/1 new installs that we've got to invest in, in the fourth quarter, so you will see a ramp up. And I think, if you do the math from our guidance range, you'll see that. But I expect absent the one-times, our SG&A trend to be sustainable and we'll continue and we'll talk more about this in December. We're going to continue to be focused on SG&A reductions.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it; that's helpful. And then I guess just on claims \u2013 I know, Tim, you talked about some of the swing factors and how we'll get claims guidance with 4Q. But I'm curious, are you comfortable today saying that you do expect claims growth in 2017, ex Coventry? And then, given the fact that it sounds like Coventry rolled off a little faster maybe than you had expected, are you comfortable saying that you could actually just see absolute claims growth in 2017 over 2016?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So I'd love to. The only reason \u2013 first of all, I won't give you guidance yet. And then, secondly, as we said, the effect of the exchange lives is not \u2013 again, we think we've got a bead on it, but I'd like another couple of months to model it out to be sure that if we make that kind of commitment to you, we deliver it. Again, we've got a very good line of sight, obviously, to our book of business and the dynamics there. And that's a very good story. But that piece is probably the biggest piece that we've just got to work our way through.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. All right, thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. You may now ask your question.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, Tim and Eric. Actually, one of them is a follow-up to the question just earlier on script count. So the script count that's coming from Coventry that's being lost at an increasing rate, is that coming from next year's 1% headwind? So we can expect next year to be a little bit better as a result? And then, related to that, if you strip out non-Coventry, non-Catamaran volumes, what does the underlying organic core growth look like?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So the answer to the Coventry is that, yes, that will impact next year in amount of claims. So we'll talk about this more specifically in December, but there will be an element of claims. Obviously, with a quicker roll-off, next year's numbers will be much lower, but there also will be some ongoing Coventry claims that we will retain beyond 2017. So, as we work through that plan, we'll give you all the specifics. But as you strip out all of these impacts, the answer is, yes, the core is growing. When you look without that, somewhere...","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","About 2.5%.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","2.5%.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, no, that's very useful. And then the follow-up is, if I'm not mistaken, you're still closing out the selling season for the mid-market, I believe? So how big of an impact can that make to guidance for next year? And how big of a year is it for you this year relative to a normal year, I guess? And I'm asking that only because I think couple years ago you guys were making a push to the middle markets, so just trying to follow up as to what impact that that's making.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I wouldn't model any sort of disproportionate contribution. What I would say is, we have always been very committed to the middle market and done well there, and this year would continue that string. But I would also point out that the middle market is a competitive market as well. It is more profitable due to the fact they take more of our tools and so forth. If you look at the Market Events program, that's sort of a preemptive enrollment. The middle market tends to like those sorts of things where you just enroll them in our programs and they perform for them. They don't have the staff to get involved with lots of detailed modeling and customization of the benefit.","And so, while it's a little bit more profitable for us to administer, therefore, I wouldn't be modeling some significant disproportionate profitability impact due to the mix of business. We've had a good mix of business this year across the piece, Garen. So while the middle market's been notably stronger, I would tell you that we've got a very large health plan we're proud to be implementing. We've got a number of other things that we're putting into place across the marketplace. So I wouldn't over tilt to the middle market.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. You may now ask your question.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi, thanks. Tim, you mentioned the 3.9% net trend across your book. Could you just expand on that a little bit? If you look at that same time period, what was the gross inflation that you guys saw, and was there any underlying utilization in that number, or should we view the 3.9% as sort of a good guide for net inflation?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No, I think you want to look at it as a guide for net inflation. It includes obviously the rebates which flow back to our clients. But I would say that that number pretty much on its own is the number. We do occasionally show clients what will happen if they don't put programs in. And so you can model out what their trend would be. We're in fact doing that with the Diabetes Care Value Program, but we don't tend to overly focus on that piece as much as picking where a client's at today and look at what can they do to continue to protect themselves and drive it down. And then we go out and contract in ways to make sure that we actually can deliver on that. So that would be the better way of thinking about it.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Are you seeing any underlying per capita utilization growth, or is that still close to zero?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No, we do. I mean that's \u2013 one of the things that's not well-understood is \u2013 and I know I called one piece out in my prepared remarks \u2013 that trend includes specialty, new drugs, and utilization. And so those are all the headwinds you have to counter when you're trying to manage to a net drug trend number. And so that's what to me makes it such a disparate conversation against the headlines that we all read, because in fact we're doing our jobs really well. And part of our job is to get out there and make sure folks understand it. Our clients sure understand it.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And then lastly, with the bulk of the selling season behind you, can you just comment on the competitive pricing environment that you are seeing and how that might compare to the last year or two?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I mean, I think it's as competitive as it \u2013 it's been competitive for my time in the business. It continues to be competitive. You see select competitors be selectively aggressive in certain spots. But I would say that I don't have anything unusual to point out to you. It is an environment where you have to compete on value. You have to demonstrate your core attributes well. And I will tell you that, again, I think what you would see is, had we had to do things that were irrational, you wouldn't see even the third quarter showing up as it had, because we would have had more early pricing and those sorts of things. We have found our model to be able to compete. We have found our retention to be strong in a pricing environment that is in line with the competitive nature of this business.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen. You may now ask your question.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Tim, when we think about this Inflation Protection plan in particular, clearly you're starting to look to go at risk on price, and you're aligning yourself with your customers. As you work with manufacturers to get them to join into the plan as well, how much does this help set up more of a market self-regulation to control drug pricing? And is this a message that you think you can take to Washington to help them understand the role that PBMs play here?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So let me step all the way back. The risk that we take on price is largely a result of the way we're able to contract. So I've been sort of describing it as we're able to reinsure that risk through our supply chain contracting methodologies.","As it relates to \u2013 and I do absolutely believe that over time that that is causing pharma \u2013 I believe we have been able to cause pharma to step back and say, it's no fun to be in the headlines. There are other ways for us to produce value for payers. And we have a chassis that we can plug into through Express Scripts to actually bring those ideas to market. And the creative conversations that we have with these pharma companies, again, is very encouraging to me. It's not transforming anything yet, but it's certainly very encouraging.","As it relates to Washington, what I would say is we are very, very much in Washington. In fact, both ourselves as a company and our industry, The Hill just a week and a half ago had a two-page piece by the PCMA CEO, Mark Merritt, describing in detail for that audience what we do. But more importantly we are spending a significant amount of time with key legislators in the decision-making areas to make sure they understand exactly what it is that we've done and what we can do. So, from that standpoint, I think that the story's a good one and we are out getting it told.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. And just a follow-up. As we think about the puts and takes here, any reason \u2013 given some of the success you're having here, obviously, with the retention rate, and sounds like the net selling season \u2013 any reason why we wouldn't expect EBITDA to be up next year? We should be seeing growth in EBITDA?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So I'm going to look over to Eric, who's going to tell you he's not going to give you guidance for next year yet, other than we're going to manage every element of the P&L very aggressively, both the cost side, as you would expect us to do, as well as ensuring that our continued upsell of these programs and continued driving of value to clients \u2013 some of which we're able to then capture \u2013 continues. But I won't go so far as to say that unless you're willing to, Eric.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No, I think we will hold that until the December discussion.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. You may now ask your question.","Brian G. Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. Tim, just to follow up on the question on the selling season. So this is obviously one of the best selling seasons we've seen in a long time. So I know in the past, George used to say you don't want to go to the high 90s, because you're leaving money on the table. So how should we be thinking about where the margins are or what the pricing looks like on the retention number for next year?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I think George was right. And I would agree with him. But I think George would also have said, and would have seen that hitting the 97% to 98% range is absolutely something that we should be able to do based on the value we create and the way that we're able to pass that value through and get credit for it, particularly in renewals, where your incumbency value can grow as you produce real results that clients value. What I would say, and agree with George, is 100% of the time you're probably not going to win because you're going to have \u2013 there's always a few clients who, for a lot of reasons, either don't align with your model or for other reasons are just going to go a different direction.","But I think that if you were to ask me a different question around is 97% the new normal for you guys? I will tell you this: We certainly are going to target to be in that 97% to 98% range moving forward. I can't guarantee it. I'm not giving you guidance for next year on that. But there's no reason that we can't keep the vast majority of our clients and do it in a disciplined way.","Brian G. Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate that. And then, Eric, one of the comments you made on volume was that you're counting the 90 days as a single script. So is that something that you're seeing some traction in? Or is that an area that's growing so something that we should think about as we model going forward, where the script count will be a little bit off just because of the shift to 90-day retail?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah. And we're seeing that as we start to see those programs evolve. As we move into December and giving you guidance for next year, we're revisiting all of this. Tim talked about some of the things we're looking at and how we give you better view to our growth. We're looking at that. But we're also looking at scripts and how they're counted, because the more these programs and the 90 days start to evolve, the greater the impact's going to be. So we're looking at how the industry is counting and what we're doing. And we will give you the follow-up on that when we release guidance in December.","Brian G. Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Eric, just a quick follow-up on that. So how should we think about the profitability of 90-day retail for you guys, just qualitatively?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, we don't get into profitability on specific programs, but I will just say that our programs are very good.","Brian G. Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right, appreciate that. Thanks, guys.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah, I would just add that we \u2013 certainly now we've positioned ourselves in the relationships that we've built with retail, to be able to offer, to Eric's point, our programs in a way that we feel very good about, in terms of the economic impact to our clients. Because I can tell you, moving those 30 days to 90 days, irrespective of channel, is extraordinarily valuable for clients, it's good for adherence, and we've gone out and transformed our contracting in such a way as to ensure that it supports our growth.","Brian G. Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","All right. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. So as we think ahead of your December 14 guidance, you talked about potentially giving us just better visibility and more transparency. So when we think about the top three drivers, can you help us \u2013 just rank for us \u2013 what are the top three drivers that have an impact on your growth algorithm?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, number one, as has always been, is our supply chain ability and the continued ability to both procure drugs on behalf of our clients, and continuing to drive down prices. As we've always said, when we drive down prices, our clients benefit, and we benefit as a result of that. So the supply chain is always going to be one of the big drivers. We'll continue to look at our SG&A and direct product costs, continuing to drive those down. And then, beyond that, our specialty business continues to grow, do very well. And I think those kind of are three areas -and finally, obviously, we talked about them, our SafeguardRx programs and the adoption of those.","So I guess I gave you four instead of three, but those are kind of the core things that drive the business.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So, as a follow-up, when we think about the supply chain that you hire, that it is one of the \u2013 is the biggest bucket. You've just renewed your agreement with Walgreens on the retail side. Do you see an opportunity there on the purchasing and supply chain side as well?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, what I'd say, Ricky, is that \u2013 and I know you've heard me say this before \u2013 I always see an opportunity to go out and ensure that our GPO is procuring generics on a net basis \u2013 net of the way that the GPO fees and so forth operate \u2013 is ensure that we've got the best arrangement, because if there's a better one, we're going to be very interested in pursuing it. We are agnostic as it relates to how we do generic purchasing as long as we're protected in the longer term, as long as we're in control of sort of some of the key dynamics. And there are a lot of ways to achieve that besides having our own GPO.","I'm not going to declare any one potential future partner, because there are a number that we will continually look at, we will put in clean rooms, and we will challenge ourselves to create additional value with. I would say our team, led by Jan Burkett, has done a tremendous job of putting us in a position where our generic purchasing for mail is very competitive, but we're going to keep looking at it.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then one final question, because you did mention earlier on the uncertainty around exchange enrollment as it flows through your health plan partners. Can you maybe help us quantify what type of benefit did you see from exchanges in 2016, just that we have some context as we think about the potential for 2017?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No \u2013 I mean, what I would tell you is \u2013 and, again, it's all inside a range, so I don't want you to be modeling out gigantic numbers. But what I would tell you is part of the reason we have a range on claims in a business that you would otherwise think is fairly easy to predict is, for example, this year we saw the exchange claims volume drop somewhere between 7 million and 8 million claims compared to our coming into the year sort of best guess, and that's why we're reevaluating kind of how we model it now.","Again, in the range, it's a headwind, it's directly attributable to two things \u2013 let me be clear. One is more of our clients have put in our utilization management programs, and so we're doing our job to help ensure that patients that shouldn't be getting products aren't getting products, that they're finding ways to resolve their issues. But also, quite frankly, again, some of our clients, based on either the premiums that they set or potentially even dropping out, saw less lives. And so this year it was a very mild headwind, but it was headwind. Next year we're going to try to give you a range where we bake that headwind in, and that's what we're working through now.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Costa of Wells Fargo. You may now ask your question.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hi. Sort of a follow-on to the last one, but more specifically regarding margins, can you give us sort of headwinds and tailwinds that you expect on margins for next year? What levers do you have to actually improve your margins for next year?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah. So really our tailwinds are the things we talked about just now: continuing to focus on cost cuts, new drug launches, continuing to manage the supply chain and the drug pipeline, the drug costs, and continue to drive those cost down as new opportunities arise. And also our specialty business and growth; we continue to see very good growth in that area of the business and would expect that to continue next year. Headwinds, as we talked about, we still got Catamaran, Coventry rolling off, additional stuff next year, and then beyond that \u2013 I don't know if, Tim, you had anything else? Those are our big ones today.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No. I think you nailed it.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","So net-net do you expect sort of an improvement or a deterioration in margin for next year?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","We'll talk about that in December.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay, thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","You know, the other tailwind that I just want to call out, because nobody's asked about it today, we talked a little bit about it as it relates to our cost. A little over a year ago, we were taking over 400 calls per 1,000 mail service scripts. Today we're taking less than 250. Our digital initiatives have driven amazing amounts of cost out of our system while improving our patient experience. Our NPS score has gone up a double-digit number of points. But it's still early in the game as it relates to converting those patients to what you'd see as mail growth. I know you'd see mild sequential growth in the quarter.","But I think the other tailwind for the longer term \u2013 maybe not even next year, because, again, I think that this is a multiyear investment horizon that we have \u2013 is in fact, when you take a look at where people are buying almost everything else today, and when you look at healthcare and the position we think we can be in in terms of the digital and the human experience that our members enjoy, I think over the longer term that there is a tailwind still in terms of minimally our omnichannel drive to 90-day, and inside of that our drive to mail. It's longer term. The good news is those investments pay off in the short term based on cost and experience improvements. And over the longer term they will pay off, I believe, in terms of again being able to help move members to the channels that are best for them, for the payer, and ultimately aligned with our interests.","Peter H. Costa - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti of Maxim Group. You may now ask your question.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Thank you. Yeah, I was just wondering if you could talk about the potential benefit of Tricare moving to Walgreens from CVS? And then any update at all on the Anthem dispute?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I'll take both of those, thanks for the question. First of all, as it relates to Tricare, the benefit is accruing to our federal government. This is us doing our job the way the contract is written it is. And so the benefit is that we're demonstrating our value. Lawmakers in D.C. pay a lot of attention to what goes on with those beneficiaries, and I can tell you in my conversations with lawmakers, they are deeply interested in beneficiary experience and in the cost of running the program. And we're demonstrating the ability to continue to drive both of those things, not have them be mutually exclusive. And so, from that standpoint, that's how that flows. You shouldn't model in some gigantic upside for us as a result. The upside is we renewed them some time ago, and we're going to continue to position ourselves to grow the program and help them stay solvent.","As it relates to Anthem, I don't have an update for you at this point, as you might imagine. What I'd just say is this: I think they're quite busy right now working on another matter, and what we're doing in the meantime is making sure they don't have to spend any more time than they need to on pharmacy by giving them great service, helping implement the programs that they are putting into their marketplaces, and positioning ourselves to be the obvious choice for them when they get to the point of taking a look at the marketplace.","What I would say also is it would not surprise me \u2013 we believe, and I think it's probably known, that Anthem is likely to put an RFP out early next year, and so you should all expect that that would be a market event that would happen. They would put an RFP out for their 2020 and beyond business. It wouldn't even shock me if we didn't get a copy of it initially. But we would expect that they would be out in the marketplace with a consult and an RFP sometime early next year. But I would tell you, again, we're working every day to give them no reason whatsoever to do anything other than to continue to allow us to serve their members.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Ross Muken of Evercore ISI. You may now ask your question","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi, this is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. I just wanted to get an update on your thoughts on potential areas of strategic interest in M&A given the changing service landscape and potentially a need to diversify? How do you think about that versus continued share repurchases? Thank you.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. So, it's an area we continue to engage in. There's a lot of activity, I'd say. And I would first point out that at least we are not bound to buy our own stock back, but we sure, at these prices, believe that that's an important way for us to deploy our cash, absent anything else.","But, that being said, we have a very disciplined approach to analyzing what's going on. We like the areas of workers' comp. We like the areas of payer and provider solutions, looking at use of data, quality, those sorts of things, healthcare information technology. We like some of the smaller niche specialty opportunities that may be out there. But, again, have to really look really hard at all these things to be sure that we spend our money really wisely. So we're engaged in a lot of looking. We'll see if anything comes to bear. We certainly are in the business of taking a hard look right now.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink. You may now ask your question.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, Tim. Can you talk about your approach to biosimilars? And maybe can you touch on Remicade, Humira, Neupogen, and Enbrel specifically? How aggressive or not are you going to get in this area? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. So obviously it depends. We're going to be very aggressive at driving down our patients' and clients' costs, and the advent of biosimilars will give us another tool, another lever to do that. How it plays out is still, I think, going to be a class-by-class, product-by-product, manufacturer-by-manufacturer set of conversations and decisions. There are certainly \u2013 we saw early on, for example, one of the biosimilars that came out tried to price itself in a way that made it unattractive compared to what we were able to do working with the brand manufacturer. We are agnostic as to who makes it as long as it's a high-quality manufacturer and it drives down our patients' cost and it creates some competition.","I also think that to talk about a point in time versus what happens over the longer term would be wrong because I think you're going to see evolution both in terms of the pricing \u2013 it's what we saw in hepatitis C just with two competing brand products, for example. It wasn't just a one-time decrease. It was sort of an ongoing set of kind of the market finding a different level. And I expect that you're going to see the same sort of thing in the biosimilars. So we've demonstrated in the small molecule space that we can work with brand manufacturers to create house generics that are good for patients and good for payers. We've equally demonstrated that we can move share away very aggressively. Interchangeability is going to be another dynamic, and a lot of that'll depend, again, on the product and the area.","What I am confident in is our specialized care model and our supply chain expertise, as I mentioned in my prepared comments, position us very, very well in a case-by-case basis to optimize for our clients their spend in these areas.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","We'll take one more question, operator.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our last question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of Bank of America. You may now ask your question.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, everybody. So it is interesting in the IMS market data, it does show for the first time in about 15 quarters that mail-order scripts in the U.S. actually grew faster than retail scripts. So just curious, are you sensing any renewed enthusiasm for mail order within your customer base? Or is 90-day retail still rising in popularity? You touched on this a little bit. But also the follow-up question would be do you feel that your current 90-day retail offerings within your network, do you feel that those are adequate, or do you feel like you still need to kind of enhance what you have right now, maybe over and above the Smart90 deal that you have with Walgreens? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So what I would say \u2013 thank you for the question. First of all, in our customer base I would say first of all there are a lot of our customers, particularly the commercial ones, that have always been enthusiastic and supportive of mail. We do see \u2013 and as we look sort of at this year's benefits hub sales for next year, we have continued to see health plans adopting the mail programs in an increasing number for certain lines of business. And so it's not completely surprising that you would continue to see, or you may see, some change in that.","I would also say from a 90-day standpoint, one of the important dynamics is 90-day programs that typically are omnichannel or offer both retail or mail, wind up growing both retail 90 and mail to the expense of 30-day scripts. And so to the extent that both we and, frankly, competitors have been moving into these 90-day programs offering both channels, it's not surprising that mail is getting fair share. And I think in our case we're very, very well-positioned to capture patients into our program.","I do, though, want to conclude by saying that the program that we currently have, I think, is exactly what our clients who have high 30-day penetration and have not been able for various reasons to put in more targeted mail programs, is exactly the program that they need. And we \u2013 as you may know, we have two different offerings, one of which does include Walgreens, and we're seeing a lot of interest, again, in those plans in particular who have historically not been able to, for a variety of reasons, necessarily strongly incent mail, but they want mail to be available, they want the 90-day program to be available, and they want to gain those savings and the clinical benefits of the program.","So actually I like very much where we sit in terms of the current program and don't see dramatic things en masse. I do think what you saw in diabetes, though, shows what we can do in targeting a class, and we have a number of other classes as we look out over the next 18 months in the chamber to take potentially more targeted, more clinically intensive approaches beyond simply just the channel approach to driving adherence, and you'll hear more about that in the coming quarters.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So with that, I want to thank everyone for dialing in today, and we will look forward to speaking to you in December when we give you our 2017 guidance.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference.

Welcome to the Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, Director of Investor Relations, Jamie Kates. Please go ahead.","Jamie Kates","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter 2014 earnings call. With me today are George Paz, Chairman and CEO; Tim Wentworth, President; Cathy Smith, CFO; and other members of our senior management.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company\u2019s plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company\u2019s actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in the company\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update, or otherwise release publicly any revisions to our forward-looking statements.","For clarity purposes, all financial numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to tables included in our press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we will be discussing. A reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our press release. The earnings release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website. This presentation will be posted on our website and includes an appendix with footnotes and the reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted numbers and EBITDA to net income.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Kathy.","Cathy Smith","Thank you, Jamie. Today, we will cover three topics. First, I\u2019ll review our second quarter financial performance and guidance. Second, Tim will provide a business update. And finally, George will address some raising questions we received from investors and provide an update on how we are positioned for the long-term growth.","During the quarter we made progress on rationalizing our footprint and delivered a quarter in line with our expectations. Adjusted claims were $324.5 million, in the middle of our guidance range. Home delivery and specialty claims increased sequentially from $30.5 million last quarter to $32 million this quarter, due to our continued focus on mail order program, a long list, the adoption of our aggressive mail programs by several of our clients for their healthcare reforms offerings.","Furthermore, we continue to see mail growth for client on a same-store basis. Once the patient starts on mail, we receive approximately 75% share of their script while our mail penetration currently stands at around 30%, our target continues to be 40%. We have the type of programs in place that will help drive our mail growth. Similar to the second quarter of 2013, this quarter reflects the $129.4 million in incremental revenue related to a client contract payment.","Year-over-year SG&A expense declined as a result of efficiencies gained from a net co-integration. As mentioned, we are making progress on decommissioning the legacy Express Scripts platform and rationalizing our operational footprint. As we announced in April, we are closing three operational sites, consolidating one contact center, and replacing the backend pharmacy in New Jersey. These savings are reflected in our 2014 guidance.","EBITDA exceeded $1.7 billion for the quarter and EBITDA for adjusted scripts was $5.35, up 10% over the prior year excluding UnitedHealth. Excluding the impact from the previously mentioned client contract statement, EBITDA for adjusted script would have been $4.95, up 9% over last year excluding UnitedHealth. We are realizing an improvement in EBITDA for adjusted script without a material increase in our junior excel rate. This improvement is attributable to supply chain performance, including the launch of our 2014 National Preferred Formulary, better management of ingredient cost, and productivity improvements. Importantly, these factors also result in significant cost savings for our client.","We reported earnings per share of $1.23 representing growth of 15% over last year excluding UnitedHealth. In addition, we generated $735.5 million of cash flow during the quarter, and repurchased 29.9 million shares for $2.2 billion. As of the end of June, we had 42.9 million [ph] revisions. During the quarter we also launched and priced a successful $2.5 billion bond offering across three tranches [ph] with a weighted average coupon of 2.55% and weighted average maturity of 6.6 years. We used the proceeds to prefund our $900 million 2.75% senior notes due November of 2014. We also reviewed all of our $1.25 billion 3.5% senior notes due 2016 at the Medco premium. The remainder of the funds will be available for our other general profit services which may include share repurchases under our share repurchase program.","As we look including the effective tax rate and diluted shares, our diluted share range now assumes approximately 28 million shares repurchased in second half of this year. With regards to our third quarter projections, earnings per share is expected to be between $1.27 to $1.31, up 22% to 26% year-over-year for UnitedHealth. All in all, is an in line quarter with some very positive trends.","At this point, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Wentworth","Thanks, Cathy, and good morning, everyone. Today I\u2019ll begin by addressing two primary areas which go hand-in-hand, specifically service excellence and client retention.","At January 1 we successfully implemented over a hundred new clients who delivered the pharmacy framework in support of the healthcare reform business of our health claim clients, executed on a comprehensive new regulatory requirement and migrated over 9 million patients to our destination platform. The integration activity specifically resulted in some isolated challenges with some of our clients, and in response to these challenges we have revamped our leadership, strongly aligned our metrics to key service indicators, and redefined our commitment to service across the organization. These changes have produced significant and sustained results. Our operational indicators show that we are now performing at or above pre-integration and strong historical levels.","Now at the heart of our successful track record of involving acquisitions is our practice of combined best of all systems and building new and more effective leadership. However, this means change which despite of best efforts often includes the loss of some account management teams. In our comments, routines bind our relationship with our clients. In light of this change, clients naturally are going to evaluate alternatives and often test the market. Express Scripts has taken advantage of this dynamic in the past when our competitors have merged, and likewise competitors are attempting to take advantage of this situation now. Due to these dynamics the retention rate for 2015 is expected to be in the range of 92% to 93%.","This retention rate combined with strong organic growth and new sales will result in expected claims volumes slightly down, to down 1.5% in 2015. As you know, Ed Ignaczak, our Executive Vice President of Sales and Account Management, is retiring after 24 years and we will miss his strong leadership and the contributions that he made to help our organization grow. In the wake of that retirement, we are extremely excited to welcome David Queller to Express Scripts as the Senior Vice President of Sales and Account Management. David comes to us from Aetna, where he was Senior Vice President of National Accounts, and David deepens our knowledge significantly on both, Health plans and large direct payers, and is uniquely suited to lead our client facing organization.","We have built the most advanced, best positioned PBM in the industry and we believe we will improve retention and win a significant share of new business going forward. And we are confident about our future for three main reasons; those are scale, alignment, and innovation. First, scale; our scale is a terrific near and long-term advantage. A great example is what we have achieved for clients through our focused management initiatives, whether delivering over $700 million in client savings through our National Preferred Formulary in 2014, or eliminating 95% of wasteful spend on compound drugs, we continue to leverage our scale to drive client savings, and provide patients access to clinically effective cost effective options.","Alignment, our client service organization provides unrivaled specialized knowledge of our clients businesses, and our healthcare landscape. Experience account teams partner with our client to deliver on their specific needs whether it is the health or health plans grow their lines of business or help our commercial clients drive down costs. Our clinical specialization provides the best care for our patients, and as we lower cost for our clients and drive better health outcomes for our patients we also deliver the value to our shareholders.","Innovation, to our merger we brought together complimentary capabilities which enable us to uniquely address our clients\u2019 needs for better decisions and healthier outcomes. We combine the advanced application of behavioral sciences together with the therapeutic resource centers which rely on specialist pharmacist to help patients make better decisions. In addition, two days ago we cut the ribbon on our 2.0 Innovation Lab, this dynamic and interactive workspace incorporates 3 of our 11 therapeutic resource centers, as well as decision designers, researchers, and other key employees who are focused on innovation. Our lab enables strong collaboration with clients to drive differentiated safety, savings, and health outcomes. Ultimately we\u2019re driving down costs, reducing waste and improving health in ways no other company can, this makes us unique in the PBM marketplace.","And in fact, a result of the research completed in the lab we published a comprehensive peer reviewed report in this month\u2019s Journal of Managed Care and Specialty Pharmacy which concluded that patients receiving their medications via RTRC led home delivery pharmacy had significantly greater adherence than those receiving their medications from any channel, including 90-day retail. The results were particularly strong in the Medicare population and adherence is one of the key drivers in the star ratings process for health plans that provide Medicare services.","We make unrivaled investments, hundreds of millions of dollars annually in our systems and processes to ensure that clients and patients have the industry\u2019s safest, most effective, and innovative and convenient pharmacy experience. Our innovation matters to clients and patients. Every day we talk with our clients and it is clear that scale, alignment and innovation along with our singular focus is what makes Express Scripts unique. Our clients need us more than ever to navigate today\u2019s complex and challenging healthcare environment.","Now switching gears to another growth driver, let me spend just a few minutes reviewing healthcare reform and its impact. One of our strengths is our large nationwide book of health plan clients. This present helps us grow with these clients in their regulated businesses including Medicare, Medicaid, and the ACA marketplace. In each of these markets we are well positioned to help our clients gain an ever increasing share of the new lives come into market. And we do not simply lied along with them as they grow, we collaborate with them closely to help them drive and manage their growth. We have managed care clients in states that cover 90% of the newly available healthcare reform lives, and our plans are taking advantage of our innovative tools in order to keep premiums lower and attract membership. Therefore, when a member moves from previous coverage in 2013 to an exchanged plan in 2014 for example, these lives are better managed which results in better health outcomes, lower costs, and increased shareholder value.","More specifically, 41% of Express Scripts sold plan added an aggressive home delivery program and 48% of Express Scripts health plans implemented more narrow pharmacy network. In a tighter managed plan, the need for a therapeutic resource centers and specialist pharmacist is greater than ever. It is important that when formularies are tightened and networks are narrowed for our patients, but they are able to get the help they need to manage therapies, adherence, and health outcomes and ultimately drive to a lower cost for our clients, and therefore greater value for our shareholders.","At this point, I will turn the call over to George.","George Paz","Thank you, Tim and good morning, everyone. I\u2019m speaking with many of you over the last several months, it is clear that there are a number of questions around the future of our business which I will address at this time.","First, regarding service, our merger with Medco resulted in change that people processed within systems which created isolated challenges for some clients. In response, we are taking clear and specific steps to improve both, the client and patient experience. And we continue to invest to enhance the service provided and optimized every patient touch point. I want to emphasize what Tim just said earlier. Our operational indicator show that we are now performing at or above pre-integration and strong historical levels.","With respect to our retention in new sales, we have always operated on a very competitive marketplace. Our focus has always been on growing shareholder value and maximizing our EBITDA growth to our model of alignment with our clients. Our retention rates which gets a lot of focus from investors is really a lagging indicator reflecting the impact of two years of integration activities. This retention rate is not the similar to previous integration years. As we after two years of integration activities we are emerging as a stronger PBM and few are even better positioned for the future to drive retention to normal level, gain market share and continue to increase shareholder value.","As we have discussed in the past, clients are different and we have always preferred to partner with clients who share our focus on managing trend, driving out waste, and improving health outcomes. Our scale, innovative tools, and alignment with these types of clients allows us to continue to grow EBITDA per reps [ph] and earnings despite lower claims of volumes.","Specialty is a primary driver of growth and it will continue to be so in the future. Our clients are facing a longing trajectory of specialty cost, including costs resulting from non-adherence, as well as significant ways. Our clinical specialization positions us to close gaps and care, drive to the most cost-effective drug, and encourage the use of the right therapy at the right time. Our comprehensive management is once again a differentiator no other company can replicate. As a result, we expect to continue to gain share in the specialty marketplace.","Regarding WellPoint, we have a strong and a well aligned relationship with WellPoint. They need our PBM innovative tools to be successful to marketplace and we grow as they grow. With 5.5 years remaining under the contract, we will continue to be \u2013 to provide a high level service and costs savings which will position us for as a continued healthy long-term relationship with WellPoint. They are our largest client and we are very proud to serve WellPoint. We expect that future organic earnings growth will come from several drivers. Our script volume is just one component. Other drivers include generic conversions, specialty pharmacy, formulary management, clinical programs, non-claims pharma services, and home delivery; all these leverage will drive EBITDA and earnings growth in the future.","I want to spend a few minutes talking about why I\u2019m bullish on the PBM industry and in particular, our positioning. Being in line with our clients best interest is the fundamental part of our business model and such alignment has never been more important than it is now. With around 90 million members, we have a unique and meaningful opportunity to reshape our pharmacy benefit delivered, and to improve patient health. Increasingly our clients are relying on us to help navigate a complex and changing regulatory environment, drive solutions designed to control costs and provide a patient experience that is second to none. Through our innovative platform we combined world-class pharmacy operations, the Express Scripts lab, clinical specialization and pharmacy data of 90 million. We provide clients with access to the breadth and depth of solutions no one else on our space offers.","Let\u2019s take a closer look at some of our key organic growth drivers. As we think about client challenges and our areas of opportunities, specialty is at the top of the list. While our clinical tools have helped hold the growth in specialty drug spend in 2013 to 14.1%, the lowest in our past six years. We forecast that specialty spend will increase an additional 63% over the next three years. The leading driver of this deep spending increase is Hepatitis C, and the introduction of costly new medications. Our clinical tools and clinical specialization will be of critical importance in taking advantage of the \u2013 as into biogenerics and competing therapies that emerge.","Another area unique to Express Scripts is our size and scale, and how we leverage it across the supply chain to manage cost for our clients. Tim talked earlier about our National Preferred Formulary. We introduce our clients to our National Preferred Formulary as a strategy to significantly lower cost while limiting member impact. The decision to implement this formulary was an important one for our clients. Over 90% of our commercial clients choose to implement this formulary. This choice was purely the choice of our clients. Our clients have expressed high levels of satisfaction, and we\u2019ll see over $700 million of savings in 2014.","We will rule out our 2015 formulary in the coming days which I anticipate will drive significant additional savings bringing the 2015 annual savings well over $1 billion for our clients. Although our mail order growth has been impacted by our mix of clients, as the cost of healthcare continue to rise, our home delivery platform will be a fundamental differentiator allowing us to drive the power of our solutions to our clients, drive lower costs generics, and improve adherence. Plan sponsors are increasingly utilizing our broad range of home delivery programs as the safest and the most cost-effective channel for giving medication to their patients. We are also investing in consumer experience which will drive their use of our Express Scripts pharmacy as the preferred pharmacy.","Also contributing earnings growth will be our continuing focus on cost improvements from streamlining and simplifying our business processes. In addition, we will continue to redeploy our excess cash for share repurchase or strategic M&A. When we think about the impact that Express Scripts will have on the healthcare marketplace, we\u2019re very optimistic that our scale, alignment and innovation positions us well for long-term growth.","This concludes our prepared remarks, and we\u2019ll be happy to answer any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","(Operator Instructions) And our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Yes, thanks and good morning. Hey George, just wanted to follow-up on some of your comments. As you seem to suggest, Express Scripts has robust clinical tools that nobody else seems to have and I hear Tim\u2019s comments regarding customer service level seemed to be a pre-Medco levels, it\u2019s kind of inconsistent with the retention rate that we saw again this summer. And I\u2019m just kind of curious if you can maybe reconcile some of those comments to give us a better sense for maybe what you saw this selling season, why maybe the retention rates were lower than what you would have liked, and maybe, if you can comment on pricing and is that playing any part within the selling season?","George Paz","Sure, thank you Glen. With pricing always plays a part, this is a very competitive market and price is incredibly important, we have very sophisticated buyers of our product and services. While price alone can\u2019t solve the issue, it really is about drug trial management, if you take $0.50 to $1 out of prescription in the sales process, that is dwarfed by putting the right formulary employees, having the right clinical tools. Nobody else at our industry has done what we\u2019ve done to try to understand the behavior of human beings and the interaction of that with specialized pharmacist. If you find yourself with a heart condition, a kidney failures, other types of things, you don\u2019t go to a general practitioner, you go to see a specialist. What we\u2019ve done \u2013 what Medco did historically, I wonder what I think the greatest assets we got from the company other than Tim was the fact that we were able to all of the TRCs which I think is really key for our future success. Having pharmacist who are trained in disease states that understand the condition of the patient, that understand the complications that family faces, at the same time trying to get the right regiment, help the doctor and the patient adhere to their medication therapies is incredibly important for our future, no other PBM has those tools and the combination of those tools with the data that we have on 90 million American steps us apart in this marketplace.","As far as retention numbers, retentions, when you think about sales \u2013 the sales that you\u2019re seeing today are a result of what\u2019s happened over the last two years \u2013 not sales but the retention rate. We did have some service flips because we lost some key account managers. When you model an M&A deal, you had to figure there is going to be disruption and change. We factored those into our numbers before we figured out what \u2013 when I make sure we could have our return hurdles and well positioned. We\u2019re very, very pleased with our medical acquisition. But to think that every client was going to get the same \u2013 the exact, everything that they had before wasn\u2019t going to be the case. We had to combine systems, we had to combine processes, people themselves when change occurs look for change, and so we lost employees, all those things combined reflect in the retention rates. Our comments were that our service levels \u2013 our call center performance, our mail performance, our specialty performance, all of our performance metrics that relate to member and high-end service levels are back to where they were. That doesn\u2019t mean that there was some compliance, that didn\u2019t have account management changes, that didn\u2019t change from us during that period. We took advantage of that one when CVS was share marked [ph] several years ago and likewise, our competitors are trying to take advantage of that today.","I think the really good news here is the impact we\u2019ve had on our selling season; our business model resonates and talks about our new lab and cutting the ribbon. The fact that we do offer programs that others don\u2019t bring our clients in to see the lab, I think is a real testament to our future and speaks to our investment in the patient experience and making sure they get the right health outcome. We are extremely excited to help our health plans grow which is our organic growth and our new sales which has been very strong this year.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","I appreciate all that detail, maybe if I just ask one follow-up on the claims guidance that you gave, if you look at sort of the claims that you\u2019re suggesting for fiscal \u201815, probably better than what we would have thought given that retention rate kind of where it is. And, so I\u2019m wondering if you could just maybe discuss some of the assumptions that might bridge that gap between that retention rate and the guidance and I think if I heard Tim correctly, in his remarks seems to be that maybe your managed care clients are attracting some new memberships, I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s a piece of it and I\u2019m sure there is some new business wins and matter of group [ph] in organic growth initiative. You can maybe just give us some qualitative comments how we should think about the claims as we move into 2015 to be helpful. Thanks.","George Paz","Yes, as our matter of group factors in over the course of this year and next year, both in the numbers, but it is the smaller portion of the overall growth. A lot of the growth is coming from just strictly new sales and our ability to help our clients grow their book of business. We have a lot of clients and we work our account teams and our sales and marketing people are out with our clients helping them grow their business. We feel good about our numbers and where we\u2019re at. This isn\u2019t \u2013 these are strong projections and there is \u2013 we do a lot of economic analysis around this and we feel good about what we said.","Tim Wentworth","So Glen, and obviously we can\u2019t project that 2015 healthcare reform pick up yet so that would actually not be \u2013 and even, we\u2019re talking about working with our health plans, our new main sales that grow their books of business that they will be installing for 71-91-11 next year and so forth, so that\u2019s the key part of the organic growth.","Glen Santangelo \u2013 Credit Suisse","Okay, thank you.","George Paz","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Thanks very much, good morning. I also had a question, as we think about EBITDA going into 2015 and any plan design changes that are going into FX for 1, \u201815. George you talked about incremental changes to your formulary driving an incremental billion dollars of savings for your customer but how do you anticipate that translates for Express Scripts, number one. And number two, did you see any increase in sale pick up around plan design changes or anything else that we should be keeping in mind around plan design changes for impact to EBITDA for 2015?","George Paz","That\u2019s a great question Lisa, it\u2019s way too early to come out on that yet but we are in the throes of those announces today. We haven\u2019t released our 2015 formulary yet, that will help and we\u2019re going to roll that out probably next week with our \u2013 with the consultants and then approach our clients, probably they are after the designs. And it really is going to be how many of them adopt the new, last year was a great year for us, 90% of our class opted into the new formulary and it was purely their choice. And the opportunity that savings and the member \u2013 the lack of member disruption really spoke heavily to the success of that program. We are hopeful we can get those kinds of numbers again for \u201815 but we don\u2019t know that. And so we hit the market and you\u2019re exactly right with new order programs, we got to go out and get all this in line and try to sell our clients over the next \u2013 the process has been going on but it\u2019s really going to come ahead over the next month or so right before we open enrollment. All of these programs have to be designed and put in place for the open enrollment period and that\u2019s coming up in September\/October type timeframe. So it\u2019s way too early to give guidance on EBITDA growth because the ultimate drivers of that is what\u2019s happens over the next couple of months.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Then \u2013 I guess just my second question which has been on pricing this year for things that you reviewed or any other new business that you were able to bring in for \u201815 George, can you just comment on the overall pricing environment first and what we\u2019ve seen historically? I know there has been some concern in the marketplace that it was a little more aggressive this year?","George Paz","That\u2019s really aggressive every year. I mean that it\u2019s \u2013 but the real question is, how do you manage that aggression and what are you trying to solve for. If we do our jobs right then it should be a win-win. Clients are always concerned, it\u2019s not comfortable when you see in your largest component of your drug cost which is specially growing at double digit numbers and \u2013 so, being able to put tools around that and help bring it in is critically important. And again like I said, PBMs are making a couple of bucks, $5 a script in EBITDA on these clients and you can cut $2 or $3 here or there. Before if I can convert a very expensive drug to a much cheaper drug, and especially in the specialty class where drugs often have a sticker [ph] price of $2,000 a month, the savings are astronomical. And that\u2019s where we got to prove ourselves with our tools and our interventions on a regular basis.","So it is an aggressive market and so it\u2019s interesting because we win and we lose. And when we lose, we always concern that we may not have understood the client right. When we win it\u2019s because we have a very strong understanding of that client and their intentions, and where they want to go. If the client is fed up with certain components of their heath design programs and we can come in with a solution, it may look like incredibly less surprising, we hear sometimes that we\u2019ve got aggressive pricing. The reality is its aggressive in our eyes because we know what the clients\u2019 intents are, we know what they\u2019re going to try to push, we put the right pieces of the pricing into the right components to maximize the outcome for the client, and the same time make a return for our shareholders. So the environment is tough, it\u2019s always been tough, we\u2019ve always told the businesses where we feel good about, where we\u2019ve said we feel good about our tools and we feel good about our growth prospects.","Tim Wentworth","If I could add one other piece of color to that, which would be \u2013 as we look at our losses, because we examine ourselves hard as you can imagine. The one thing I would say is different is, it\u2019s not about aggressive pricing but it may look that way. I think that there were several losses that we\u2019ve had this year where typically you have incumbency value because of the money you\u2019ve saved your clients, the programs you\u2019ve put in place, the service you\u2019ve delivered. And I think we had a handful of losses where incumbency value turned out to be zero, maybe even a little bit negative because of that and so that\u2019s not irrational pricing that would take that away, that\u2019s simply that we don\u2019t have the opportunity to stay disciplined as we do, and at the same time keep the client based on what happened.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","Okay, great. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","And our next question will come from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America","Hi George, the current rate of share repurchase \u2013 you exit the public arena here in about six years, are there deals that you need to do here in near term to position for maybe opportunities you\u2019re speaking to that might detract from that repo effort?","George Paz","You know share repurchase is important to us. We believe we need the support of our shareholders who produce a lot of cash, and we\u2019ll continuously deploy that capital as we find a better use for that capital. And the best use is two-fold of course, one is the constant investment in our own full rams, because they will turn our own businesses strong, but that doesn\u2019t take a lot, we\u2019re not a capital intensive industry. And of course, the second use is key strategic opportunities. We have a group of people, including myself, and Tim, and Cathy that constantly look in for opportunities in the marketplace, there is a lot of healthcare that\u2019s mismanaged, are not managed, and to the extent we can use our tools and our processes and our people to better manage an aspect of the marketplace. We will definitely take advantage of that, obviously, we can\u2019t get into specifics here as we haven\u2019t disclosed anything.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America","And do you expect George to have any kind of formal presentation on your oncology strategy or is that something that gets rolled out as part of the broader, sort of specialty offering in there? Are you looking to distinguish that in anyway shape before?","George Paz","That\u2019s a great question. We plan on doing an Investor Day again in the winter, so \u2013 yes, let us take that under advisement and see because specialty is as you are alluding to, most important part of our future growth and managing drug trend, so this is something we should probably get a little more detail and meet on the bone around.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And the next question is going to come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Yes, good morning.","George Paz","Good morning.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","What percent of the selling season is still pending decision? And Tim, I think you talked about incumbency values, so when we think about the Medco legacy business, what percent of legacy Medco contract has still not come up for renewal since the merger has been completed?","George Paz","Yes, so \u2013 what I would say, looking inside, give me the first part of your question again?","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Just what percent of the selling season has \u2013 is still pending decision?","George Paz","Yes, it\u2019s fairly small amount now. It\u2019s alleged number of cases relatively speaking because it\u2019s a lot in the middle market, but in terms of both, in our book, specifically in our book actually, it is predominantly now over as it worth. That being said, we actually have a very nice pipeline that we continue to pursue right now, collaborating with our health plans as well as in a direct basis with our mid-market sort of business but still is available. And I\u2019m not going to get the real detail on the Medco legacy piece other than to say, we\u2019ve been very successful this year with that and there is not a lot that we haven\u2019t dealt with, we certainly have lost some of that as well but I would tell you that there is not a lot left there.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay. And then you highlighted that you\u2019ve addressed the service levels and they took back, kind of, like your metric pre to Medco acquisition. So, when we think about the amount of SG&A investment required, are you happy with the size of your current sales force, are you looking to increase it? Should we think about additional SG&A investments or do you think that at this point you\u2019re in good position?","Tim Wentworth","One of the things that I think is really important to understand that is that we through the last two years recognized the importance of account management and we did not \u2013 that was not the place we did any synergizing to speak up, we were really very focused on having that to be a strong part of our business and as George mentioned, unfortunately even in that context, we lost some folks. What I would tell you is particularly with David Queller joining us and bringing a whole new set of eyes to something I\u2019ve managed for a long time and Ed did as well, we\u2019re going to continue to look at it and figure out how to strengthen it. And if you take a look at account service, it\u2019s not going to move the needle one way or the other on SG&A, that\u2019s simply not the decision point that you really drive that. What we\u2019re looking for is, what could we do to be more effective and set the standard in account service and that\u2019s really where we\u2019re at.","George Paz","I\u2019m just have to pile on a little bit. If you ever ask me if I\u2019m satisfied with my SG&A, the question will be no. We are \u2013 we always have a process improvement, so eliminating the waste, figuring out redundancies and where costs are being spent, that\u2019s not adding value to our shareholders or our patience, and we eliminate those. And as we\u2019re going through the final steps of our integration processes, that\u2019s a key focus as ours as we\u2019re consolidating footprint and we\u2019re eliminating the legacy Express Scripts system and taking a lot of actions to reduce cost. However, we reinforce what Tim said, account touching the field force is not part of that, that\u2019s neither been part of the equation, it\u2019s all the support and outside of that area that\u2019s the focus.","Ricky Goldwasser \u2013 Morgan Stanley","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks for the questions. I just wanted to ask one on utilization. You guys have been calling for or calling out flat growth all year despite \u2013 few other data points pointing to a pickup in script growth. I guess, maybe just an update, what you guys are seeing today both from an ACA and a core utilization perspective, and then it be helpful if we could understand a little bit of what you\u2019re factoring into that down slightly to down 1.5% as far as utilization?","George Paz","We\u2019re not seeing growth in utilization, it\u2019s been zero to slightly up, not anything of any magnitude, and we still haven\u2019t seen those numbers change. So you know, what we\u2019ve factored into our growth projections are \u2013 our claim counts were still flat, utilization \u2013 we don\u2019t see those numbers changing.","Cathy Smith","Yes, and then as far \u2013 Bob, for healthcare reforms we\u2019re seeing \u2013 consistent with what we\u2019ve said, around 11 scripts per member, right now it\u2019s pretty consistent.","George Paz","Which is just slightly lower than we referenced rest of the book, and it\u2019s around 12 or so.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","So not a lot of factor into that outlook, is that fair?","George Paz","Yes.","Cathy Smith","Yes, definitely.","George Paz","As Tim said, we haven\u2019t really put any numbers in of any magnitude for healthcare reform for next year and we haven\u2019t really factored in any utilization growth. If we can get utilization back up to 2% growth again, that would be a huge upside to our numbers.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just on the mail and specialty, it looks like up 7% growth sequentially in the mail pan [ph], increased nicely. Just on those two metrics, any more detail you can share behind what drove both the total sales growth and then the mail pan increase in the quarter?","George Paz","I said this in the first quarter, and I\u2019m not sure people really took it to heart but we did see utilization drop in the first quarter and it didn\u2019t smell in the second quarter. So we got the benefit of people coming back and getting their scripts, and we\u2019ve been \u2013 during the last year we were aggressive selling our mail order programs, and the way a lot of those work as if you go to exclusive or preferred home delivery as you get \u2013 you get your first two scripts in retail, then you get converted into mail, that gives us a chance to make for an orderly easy transition without people missing their medication. So, something in the first quarter we also saw the retail effect of that as people were gearing up for the mail that came through in this quarter. So I would tell you it\u2019s a combination of our mail order programs kicking in and stuff that Tim talked about, although it wasn\u2019t a big number, healthcare reform, many of those eyes selected a more aggressive mail order programs and it\u2019s \u2013 so we feel good about where we ended the second quarter.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks so much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Eric Percher with Barclays.","Eric Percher \u2013 Barclays","Thank you, a question for Cathy. Now that you\u2019ve been in the seat coming up on six months, so I\u2019d be curious to hear a little bit of your effort to improve the process and financial systems and drive more work as precision.","Cathy Smith","Yes, I appreciate that. As we\u2019ve shared in the past, we have a number of projects in progress right now with regards to consolidating our financial systems and in the \u2013 six or seven different projects, we\u2019re going to take the bulk of this year and none of that happens overnight as you would imagine. And all of that will help us everything from a consolidation tool a forecasting tool, and then just more consistency around just a basic general as your cost account [ph] that kind of stuff. We\u2019re in the middle of all of those projects right now, and the bulk of unfinished at the end \u2013 towards the end of this year with regards to our goals \u2013 some of those go into mid next year. And the combination of all of those will dramatically improve \u2013 my teams, they\u2019re going to \u2013 they will turn more and more attention to analysis because it\u2019s just a manual process we have to get through right now. So I\u2019m really excited about what\u2019s going to be as opposed to whether.","Eric Percher \u2013 Barclays","Thank you, that\u2019s helpful.","Operator","And the next question will come from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","Hi, thanks very much. George, in the past you\u2019ve done a great job of articulating how your business model aligns very well with all your clients, particularly around generics. Do you feel like you\u2019ve accomplished that at this point with specialty, or put another way, are you guys financially incented to drive specialty costs down overtime?","George Paz","That\u2019s a great question, John. It would be so much better \u2013 and Dr. Miller [ph] spends a lot of time on that and with the administration in attempting to find better and easier pathways to bring biologic generics into the marketplace. When that occurs, that significant upside for us and significant upside for our clients, and this is going to improve adherence for our patients, less cost, less strain, less concern. So that\u2019s a huge whole mark. Are we aligned, yes; many of our formulary decisions that we\u2019ve made last year were in the specialty stage, just an easy example, is growth hormones. There is a lot of different alternatives out there, limiting access, other specialty classes we did the same thing. We\u2019re focusing market share to certain manufacturers provides significant savings in those classes, so we are aligned from that regard as we move people into less expensive therapies and drive down cost. We would be better aligned if we had a generic alternative and we\u2019ll continue to focus on that and drive it, and that would be a big win for our industry and for us in particular.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","Great, thanks. That is very helpful. One other thing just to clarify, given all the comments on the call around service levels, are you making that for incremental investments to further improve our service levels or do you feel like you\u2019ve got appropriate resource staffing at this point for that?","George Paz","We\u2019ve spend a lot of money, John, every year on service levels. The big challenges we face each and every year is to stay compliant with Medicare, so that\u2019s one of our huge investments as we keep our platform, and our people, and our programs in line with Medicare requirements. So we\u2019re always spending money there. Incrementally, I would say no, we\u2019re not really increasing the spend, we\u2019re actually taking out cost overtime because running two different platforms and two different environments was not inexpensive. And so we are taking those savings and we\u2019re redeploying it, some of it back into our service operations, and a lot of it back to our shareholders. So our goal over the next, the remainder of this year is to eliminate those redundant platforms and processes, and drive out cost out of our systems.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","Okay, thank you.","George Paz","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","Thanks, good morning, George, Tim and Cathy. So I guess just a follow-up on the 2015 outlook. Over the past few years you guys have made some occasional late year references to in-group membership attrition within your existing customer base for the following fiscal year and that was sort of a negative surprise, but it sounds like for 2015 you\u2019re already not expecting this which is obviously encouraging. So just curious, if there is any chance you can give some additional color on your early visibility on this for 2015? Thanks.","George Paz","I\u2019ll take a step and Tim can certainly come in. I think what we saw was when healthcare reform was getting all the limb in the sales, there was a lot of people in the hospitality business and others that were either coming out, not \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t say a lot, several though, cut out providing the health benefits to their membership. And at the same time a lot of employers took lower levels salary, less skilled jobs, and took them under 30 hours. I still think you\u2019re seeing that, I still think you\u2019re seeing a growing of under 30 hour work procrastination. And that of course affects us as they don\u2019t provide, so \u2013 but I think a lot of that ships are lost \u2013 left to dock. We don\u2019t \u2013 although it\u2019s still happening, it\u2019s not happening at the pace we saw it couple of years ago. What we\u2019re seeing today though is a real desire by our heath plans to grow their books of business, and our partnership I think with bringing Tim on board a couple of years ago, the focus we\u2019ve had on the clients, we\u2019re excited about having David and all his experience in the health plan arena. We believe we can shell \u2013 when we\u2019ve got a track record now of going out and helping our clients, target clients that aren\u2019t theirs, and primarily the combined medical PBM program just to save money and that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing is the fruits of that labor as we work closely with our health plans to try to grow. Our goal is to grow through that and help them be successful and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re doing.","Steven Valiquette \u2013 UBS","Okay.","Operator","And our next question will come from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies.","Brian Tanquilut \u2013 Jefferies","Hey, good morning guys. George, one thing that you mentioned in your prepared remarks is how you thought that retention was a lagging indicator for your business. So, where you sit today plus all the progress you\u2019ve had with the integration process, I mean would you say that we\u2019ve seen the bottom of the retention rate at this point?","George Paz","You know, I \u2013 we haven\u2019t given \u201815 guidance and we\u2019re trying to make sure that we\u2019re working our relationships with all of our clients. I don\u2019t want to really give a strong number for next year yet, I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to position or going through assessing all that. And \u2013 I like to think we\u2019re at the bottom but we\u2019ll figure that out over the next couple of \u2013 next quarter or so before we give you \u201815 guidance. I don\u2019t know, Tim, you want to\u2026","Tim Wentworth","No, I mean, the only thing I would add is, \u201815 to \u201816 is not a normally large year. We are \u2013 we know where those accounts are, we have obviously, great relationship with the majority of them, the ones that we know we\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve had work to do when it came through at migration for example, I think we\u2019ve now got stabilized and we have to just continue to drive the results in the stability moving forward. In a couple of cases there are new account teams that were training on the new system, and those sorts of things. So I\u2019m with George, I want very much to believe that this year \u2013 and I do believe this year is the bottom but I know I\u2019ve said that last year and I got \u2013 I don\u2019t look like I was right on that this year. So it\u2019s too early to call, but I like everything that we\u2019ve done and all the things that we we\u2019re doing I think was very well positioned, both in terms of service. But really importantly, again, we\u2019re going to be putting a new formulary out, our clients who have seen the benefit of that \u2013 both clients who are on it and clients who are not but have seen the way we managed \u2013 manufactured generally in a very high inflation environment, they see the differentiation. Even there are consultants who quite frankly, may have been the most critical as we finalized integration, said two things, as I went meet with them and talked to them, is they desperately want the integration behind us because they realized that it was an event that was big and challenging. But they saw that our model and our scale would differentiate and are focused, and so I actually \u2013 and strongly of the view that our renewals next year should reflect that.","Brian Tanquilut \u2013 Jefferies","And just a follow-up to that Tim, you\u2019ve talked about inflation being high, so how do you \u2013 what are discussions like as it relates to generic inflation and how do you protect your margins as we see generic rates go higher, or generic prices go higher? Thanks a lot.","Tim Wentworth","I\u2019ll let Cathy talk about some of our margins. What I\u2019ll say is our clients have \u2013 we \u2013 generic is still the best place for them to be. The generic inflation has not been a driver of overall trend for them at all because as you know, the brand spend, even as the number of scripts that are generic is high, the brand spend is still well over half of the spend and then you add specialty to that, and quite frankly, generic inflation is a high class problem compared to the big things that we\u2019re facing with our clients.","George Paz","You know the other side to that is, when you look at generics, we buy from our mail order which is really important that we buy on long-term contracts. And so we often can shield ourselves against those situations when those things are kicking in and look for other manufacturers that in fact we are getting hit with and we have enough lead time, so we better brace ourselves for that. Generic inflation really hasn\u2019t been a significant issue for us today, there has been some effect but not material.","Brian Tanquilut \u2013 Jefferies","Got it guys, thanks.","Cathy Smith","And so the same way that we buy on long-term contracts and have protections there and the way it has not been a significant impact for us.","Brian Tanquilut \u2013 Jefferies","Okay, thank you.","George Paz","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Partners.","David Larsen \u2013 Leerink Partners","Hey guys, congratulations on a good quarter. Can you maybe just give your thoughts on clinical programs that you have at the retail? And can you maybe just touch on your Smart90 program or other programs that can compete effectively with making end choice or do you typically focus on clients where their incentives are aligned with mail? Thanks.","Tim Wentworth","Sure. What I would tell you, first of all, our clinical programs work across all the channels, that\u2019s most important point that I can make. And they are strong continued element of what we see as we up sell, both in terms of our utilization and bundles our rational Med program increasingly prior offs and step therapies, and of course prior offs not only in the Medicare business but in other businesses and other long businesses as well. So all of that \u2013 formulary management, now interestingly, if you take a look at formulary management, mail versus retail, it\u2019s 50% more effective and actually converting patients to preferred scripts. So, we certainly have clients that are continuing to be interested in mail and I believe overtime mail is going to re-emerge as an incredible important attribute to managing down the overall cost of drugs and gaining maximal rebates for those products which are rebuttable.","That being said, the other part of your question which is around the prevalence or sort of our view of the 90, as you probably know, we have two different approaches, both of which provide a retail maintenance alternative, one with Walgreens and then one with a different network, let\u2019s say, and in both cases those \u2013 again, we overlay our clinical programs, our TRC pharmacists, if a patient is at the retail counter and they go home and they have a question, they can go on their phone and within one minute a specialist pharmacist from our pharmacy will call on that number. So we really have \u2013 we believe it\u2019s a single integrated piece and we work with each client to make sure that they\u2019ve got the network that works best for them to deliver care. We have not seen dramatic increases in the uptake of the maintenance \u2013 the retail maintenance programs, I would say it\u2019s an arrow in the quiver [ph] rather than a fundamental strategy.","David Larsen \u2013 Leerink Partners","Great, thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question will come from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group.","Anthony Vendetti \u2013 Maxim Group","Thank you. Actually I\u2019m wondering if we can just \u2013 I know you said not much of the selling season is left but we could play a little more metrics on some of the new client wins or net new wins, or specifically, what \u2013 which large clients have left to give a guidance of 92% to 93% retention rate for 2015. Just a little more color around that would be helpful. Thanks.","George Paz","Well, we don\u2019t mention client names. I think it\u2019s not a good habit to get into people calling clients, these clients don\u2019t necessarily want that. Some of them are public, the southern State of Florida, and Texas teachers, things like that are \u2013 those are all public deals so you can get those names, you can see those lots. But I think it\u2019s important to note that for the losses we had or major big script comps, and if we were not lost those for, our retention rate would have been 96% plus. So those had big impacts, so I would also tell you though that \u2013 I\u2019m not trying to cry over spilt milk here, or not reemphasize the issue because we don\u2019t like to lose. But those clients being state-run auctioned processes are a lot different than a lot of other clients, and it\u2019s wiser to say that these clients were at the lower end of our EBITDA ranges. So it\u2019s \u2013 again, we don\u2019t like to lose but it\u2019s \u2013 we feel four of them had a big impact.","Anthony Vendetti \u2013 Maxim Group","Okay, thanks. That\u2019s helpful.","George Paz","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee \u2013 Cowen & Company","Yes, thanks for taking the questions guys. I\u2019m wondering to talking a little bit about exclusion lists, in a couple of fashions. First, obviously, you may be announced a while back list of all the financial formulary \u2013 how did that affect your specialty pharmacy business, particularly for the part of business that\u2019s in network with expressed transfers [ph] despite those other \u2013 even with clients that are using maybe a different PBM? And then more generally \u2013 there has been some noise about other drugs getting dropped off the \u2013 off your formulary here, if you could talk more generally, how you go about deciding what drugs get excluded? And then do you see more drugs overtime, because it seems like it\u2019s something you\u2019ve been talking about more over the last year or so, is this \u2013 do you see this as a new major tool for you in managing cost? Thanks.","Tim Wentworth","So let me just start with the facts, Sovaldi is on our formulary, it\u2019s the only drug available in its class and so forth, so that\u2019s important. That being said, we have been very vocal about Sovaldi and we are anxiously awaiting competitive products. In the broader sort of spirit of your question, let me have Dr. Miller talk about how we think about building a formulary, specifically with the clinical starting point because that is the most important message you can take away. So I\u2019ll turn it over to Steve.","Steve Miller","Yes, thanks Tim. As you know, we always have the good clinical first. And so we are not only proud of the fact that we have a totally external P&T Committee that makes these decisions for us. So that P&T Committee is not employed by Express Scripts or they get a stipend from us, they are a clearly independent and their decision is binding on the company. The clinical decision is always placed first. And to your point, there are greater opportunities going forward to actually narrow formularies than ever before and we\u2019ve seen this in the traditional oral solid side, but we\u2019re now seeing a lot of competition across specialty drugs, even across oncology agents. So we really believe that in the future, we\u2019re going to be able to narrow formularies, drive patients to the best clinical outcomes but also get phenomenal results for our plan sponsors and our members.","And so last year when we did our formulary, as you know, we had exclusions in five different specialty classes which truly leads the industry. And I think you\u2019re going to see increasing opportunities going forward, so I think you should look out for us continuing to narrow other classes because we believe we can get the best clinical outcomes but also best economics for our patients and our plan sponsors.","George Paz","I think we have two more questions in the queue, so we\u2019ll take those and then conclude.","Operator","Alright, the next question is going to come from Garen Sarfian with Citigroup.","Garen Sarfian \u2013 Citigroup","Good morning, everyone. Not to beat on the retention issue too much but I just have to ask on it again in a little bit different format. You guys have mentioned the retention issues based on the M&A and some service issues, I \u2013 we can appreciate that but at least on hind side, it sounds like \u2013 it doesn\u2019t sound like there is anything sort of new to come out of that. So I\u2019m just wondering what functions had you made because I\u2019m assuming that of course, 100% as your goal, what functions had you made in terms of retention that sort of didn\u2019t hold true, that led to perhaps, not as ideal of a rate that you guys have now?","George Paz","I think there is a couple of things. When we go into the retention process we try to evaluate the relationship that your account team has with that client. We also try to evaluate where the pricing and the market price is going to be. If you\u2019ve got a great relationship and you\u2019ve got an open dialogue, when you have the incumbency, you have the opportunity, you can handsomely talk to that client and get feedback and understand where you\u2019re at and if they want you to win, the opportunity of win goes up significantly. If you have service issues or you have turnover and you had new account management or the account management team isn\u2019t performing at the level they want, our business is no different than any other business, it\u2019s still about people and relationships. And so, if we don\u2019t have those then we lose. And that \u2013 if you asked us, I think going into this year we thought our relationships were better, we priced our products based on relationships and did what we could to try to retain and maintain shareholder value, at the same time deliver value to the patients and the clients. And quite frankly, we missed on several of them. And that\u2019s \u2013 again, I do think when you look at quality of the account team, it\u2019s an integral part of this process and we missed there.","Tim Wentworth","I think the other thing I would add is, and then even the best account team in a company that\u2019s been merged together, that had two systems operating at the same time, some of whom were \u2013 had experienced one versus the other, just getting things done for your client, I think we may have \u2013 in a couple of cases, underestimate [ph] how difficult that was for specific account teams with specific clients. And so even terrific account teams can be made to look bad if you don\u2019t really tap that down, and that\u2019s why getting this migration done was painful as it was, doing in two years instead of the three that would have been a lot more luxurious with absolutely right answer because both of our member service abdicate on the phone having the target between the two systems, as well as our client facing folks who have been working inside of an organization that was still bound by two systems, it made it in some cases, a little more challenging than it should have.","Garen Sarfian \u2013 Citigroup","And you said that your operational metrics has improved, so the service aspect of it which Tim you just highlighted, you can sort of gauge that and measure that. But how about on the relationship side, obviously, do you guys put new retention bonuses now so that there is no further turnover within your sales teams or how do you \u2013 what do you do to sort of fix that for the next cycle?","Tim Wentworth","We would feel that we have stabilized our teams, again, we \u2013 the turnover that came was unfortunate and regrettable. But we do believe that is more than largely stabilized, our incentives are very level lined and very strong as it relates to service, satisfaction, which ultimately yields retention and retention is end result of all the other things as we have said before, and we feel very good about that. I think the last piece is, as George said, we are constantly reevaluating what we do in our cost structure and \u2013 that\u2019s a lower cost but to be more effective, and the better job we do at that, the easier think we is for the teams to work across the organization on behalf of clients.","George Paz","We also pull our clients, so we have action survey to our clients and we have a very high response rate, and of course, if we see issues we jump on.","Garen Sarfian \u2013 Citigroup","Got it, I\u2019ll stop there. Thank you.","George Paz","I think we have one last question in the queue, we\u2019ll take that and then conclude.","Operator","That will come from George Hold [ph] with Deutsche Bank.","Unidentified Analyst","Hey, good morning guys, and I appreciate you squeezing me at the end. Tim, maybe a quick question for you, I\u2019m going to hit the retention topic one more time. If we look at the client attrition, I guess, can you give us \u2013 can you talk to us directionally about whether you lost more clients from the legacy ESI side or the Medco side? And I\u2019m thinking if the platform transition closed a lot of the client dissatisfaction, the clients on the Medco side should have been largely unaffected, I know it would have been the ESI clients that were dissatisfied. So I guess just more color as we think about the attrition from \u201814 into \u201815, kind of what\u2019s driving it? And is there anything specific about the customers who are living that we can identify?","Tim Wentworth","What I would say is, the piece that I think you need to understand is, we\u2019ve lost clients that were part of legacy \u2013 if I look back, sense the integration, sort of \u2013 it\u2019s a pretty equal mix over the last two years. What I would say though is for different reasons, and so if you think about the legacy Medco accounts, their teams, if we didn\u2019t retain them \u2013 then they get introduced to new teams, that was another reason to be a little bit less bound so forth. So even though we didn\u2019t make a transition, we had teams come in and also have to learn in new organization that worked through. The flipside is to your point, on the legacy Express Script side, those clients migrated on a system and that went very, very well for 99% of the clients and for 1%, unfortunately, it didn\u2019t and those are the ones that we have had to really, really focus on and have had some losses on. So I would tell you that really is across both the platforms and going forward, from where I\u2019m sitting, we are positioned as a single company and as I look at that retention, \u201815 moving into \u201816, it\u2019s going to be this Express Scripts company with a very solid account team and a very solid internal operational organization that is going to win and keep the clients, or not, but I believe well positioned to win and keep the clients.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, I appreciate that. And then, maybe just a quick follow-up, I want to make sure that I heard George right, it seems like the client losses were relatively chunky and kind of X4 clients retention would have closer to a 97% number, is that correct?","Tim Wentworth","That is absolutely correct.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Tim Wentworth","Four clients is nearly 50% of the total.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, I appreciate the color. Thank you.","George Paz","Thank you. We thank everyone for joining us this morning. We are \u2013 as we said in our prepared comments, we are very big bullish on our business model, what we have top for our clients, we have under relenting focus on patient service and satisfaction, and add drives of the client service and satisfaction. So we\u2019re excited about our future. And again, thank you for your time this morning. Everyone have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude our conference for today.

Today we'll cover three topics, our second quarter performance and updated 2015 guidance, an update on our business, and key opportunities in the marketplace.","Before Jim reviews the second quarter results, I'd like to share my thoughts in the current environment. The changing landscape validates the need for size and scale. However it's how size and scale is leveraged that matters. We have designed our business model to align the needs of our clients and patients to optimize our size and scale, allowing us to take bold actions that control client costs and improve patient outcomes.","Today in health care specialized care matters to patients and clients. We offer it at every turn. Our pharmacists have specialized training in specific disease states. Our specialized pharmacy, Accredo, offers the best care for complex Specialty patients. Our Home Delivery experience is specialized for patients. And our solutions are tailored for specialized clients and patient needs.","Clients and patients have an independent, fully-aligned partner to help them successfully navigate the complex landscape. Our business model assures a completely shared agenda with clients. With their trust we can leverage our size and scale to change health care. Our strong performance this quarter demonstrates that we are built to win.","I'll now turn it over to Jim to review our second quarter results and discuss our updated guidance.","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George. Good morning everyone. We reported EPS of $1.44, which represents an increase of 17% year-over-year. Overall we exceeded our quarterly EPS guidance by $0.03 at the midpoint, half from core business operating income and half from capital structure. Consistent with recent years this quarter reflects $147.1 million incremental revenue related to a client contract payment.","Other key metric highlights include adjusted claims worth $321.2 million, slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Excluding the impact from the previously mentioned client contract payment, EBITDA per adjusted script would have been $5.15, also up 4% over last year. We are realizing an improvement in EBITDA per adjusted script attributable to managing Specialty, Formulary Management, and an increase in the aggregate generic fill rate. All of which result in a significant cost savings for our patients and our clients.","In addition we generated $899.9 million of cash flow during the quarter, up 22% year over year. We generated \u2013 or I should say, a strong performance in Q2 cash flow positions us to deliver cash flow from operations at $4.5 billion to $5 billion for 2015.","During the quarter we repurchased 55.1 million shares under a $5.5 billion accelerated share repurchase program, which represents 85% of the estimated shares (sic) [$5.5 billion purchase price] (5:09). We expect a settlement of the remaining portion [indiscernible] (5:11) to occur in the first half of 2016.","Our model of alignment and focused scale is driving improved operating and financial results. As a result of these improvements and the impact of the accelerated share repurchases during the second quarter, we are increasing our full-year EPS guidance by $0.08 to a range of $5.46 to $5.54 or growth of 12% to 14% over 2014. The ASR contributes $0.05 to the increase in the EPS range with the remaining increase largely due to our improved operating results.","With respect to the third quarter of 2015 we expect EPS to be in the range of $1.41 to $1.45, up 9% to 12% year over year. Throughout the remainder of 2015 we will execute on our model of alignment, which will drive value for our patients and clients, while generating strong returns for our shareholders.","At this point I will turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Thanks, Jim. And good morning everyone. As Jim stated we delivered a solid financial performance in the second (6:20) is strongly resonating with clients and patients who value our solutions.","We're providing a preliminary estimate of our 2016 adjusted claims volume in the range of 1.255 million to \u2013 sorry, 1,255,000,000 to 1,295,000,000. There are many factors that impact this estimate, including the completion of our 2015 renewal and selling season, loss of acquired scripts, client, and other organic growth and utilization.","Regarding our renewal season, we are updating our retention rate to a range of 95% to 97%. We have largely completed the renewal season for our health plan book of business and are very pleased with our performance. This reflects the value our health plan clients place in our account teams, our expertise, and our unique solutions.","For our commercial book of business we enter an important stretch over the next few months as mid-market clients make their decisions. Our performance to date and the positive feedback we continue to receive gives us confidence that we will have strong retention across the board.","As we have previously discussed, we will lose approximately 40 million to 45 million scripts due to client acquisitions.","As expected, we have seen good activity in new sales across our book. While we do not discuss specific client wins, we are encouraged as our new clients tell us they believe in our model of alignment, appreciate our laser focus on the pharmacy benefit, and value the way we uniquely drive out inappropriate costs, while providing superior care for patients. The result is that our business outlook remains strong and our momentum continues.","Importantly, our model is also focused on development of innovative solutions built in close collaboration with our clients. These solutions, which spring from our unique, focused, clinical, and behaviorally focused model, begin with the fundamental premise that each member is either a patient or a prospective patient, rather than simply a consumer. Our ability to coordinate care drives better health outcomes for patients and drives down costs for our clients. This model is clearly different from that of our competitors.","And our solutions are in great demand. For example as more high cost drugs come to market, Specialty is the number one focus for our clients and is a top focus for us as well. With Accredo, our therapeutic resource centers, specialist pharmacists, UBC, and our Specialty distribution business, we generate value from new medicines for both patients and clients alike.","As you saw last week the first of a new class of cholesterol lowering drugs, PCSK9 inhibitors, was approved. While these drugs are being viewed as breakthrough, they also have the potential to wreak financial havoc on clients who do not proactively manage their Specialty trend and spend. Our clinical programs for PCSK9 inhibitors and for all other Specialty drugs uniquely ensure that the right patients get the right drugs through the right channel at the right price, and that they use them effectively.","Only Express Scripts combines a robust collection of solutions with the size, scale, and client alignment to truly change the market. This is how we move more value to clients, better care to patients, and continued growth for Express Scripts. I'll now hand it back to George.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim. We are excited about our future for many reasons, but today I want to highlight three of these reasons, Home Delivery, Specialty, and Formulary Management.","First, some thoughts about Home Delivery. Our model of alignment drives a higher Mail penetration over the long term. However over the past two years we have had lower than expected retention levels of our existing clients, resulting in a loss of disproportionate number of Home Delivery scripts.","Notwithstanding these losses we continue to believe in the overall benefit and long-term growth of Home Delivery. Our Home Delivery offers greater safety, more convenience (10:27) and continuous access to expert pharmacists from the privacy of their home.","Patients who utilize the Mail channel exhibit stronger adherence rates and better Formulary Management when compared to retail. Of course this results in better health outcomes.","Ultimately we are focused on continuing to improve the patient experience in Home Delivery. As consumers take a greater role in their health care, they will have a larger influence on the delivery of prescription drugs. We are transforming Home Delivery from its origin as a payer solution to a consumer-centric model that grows as a result of patient demand. Therefore we are continuing to invest in Home Delivery, taking the steps necessary to improve the overall patient experience and to position us for growth.","With respect to Formulary Management, we provide flexible offerings that achieve industry-leading drug trend. We have saved clients billions of dollars over the past few years through smarter Formulary Management, while ensuring patients have access to the most effective, lowest cost drugs. Later this week we'll announce our 2016 National Preferred Formulary. Once again it will deliver additional value with minimum disruption.","Finally, a few words about Specialty. Specialty drugs are expected to account for half of the total drug spend by 2018. And this is an opportunity we are focused on and investing in. The landscape constantly changes, and we are best positioned to help clients manage it. We combine our Accredo Specialty pharmacy, the expertise of specialist pharmacists, and our therapeutic resource centers to deliver excellent care to complex patients, while controlling costs for our clients.","We have great opportunities to provide the highest quality care at the best price to patients and clients. We align the interest of our clients to take advantage of these opportunities, which will result in more savings to them, better health outcomes for our patients, and higher returns for our shareholders.","Thank you for your time today. And we will now take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much and good morning everyone. George, if I back into the claims number that Tim talked about, it looks like you might have won $3 billion-plus in the selling season, maybe somewhere between $3 billion and $5 billion, depending on what your assumption were for utilization.","Can you talk about the Home Delivery, Specialty, Formulary Management? What do plan design look like for 2015? So you talked about alignment and why people selected you because of alignment. But can you give us a little more color, one, around some of the clients that you won? Obviously without naming them. And then, two, if you could just give us some of that color around how do we think about plan design and some of the things that they're going to implement for 2015? Both retention as \u2013 or renewals as well as new business.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Sure. And good morning, Lisa, and thanks for the question. You know we \u2013 I'll certainly talk some about this, but I'm also going to ask Tim to chime in here.","With respect to our model of alignment, to us a client has never been just a client. We really are focused on clients who share our interest in driving down costs. So what we look for is clients who want to be part of our National Preferred Formulary that have \u2013 that want to be part of our Specialty programs.","These are really important to us, because when we deal with clients on one side, we're servicing patients on another, and on the other side we are dealing with pharma. And it's important that when we go to pharma that we have a focused book of business that allows us to drive the best discounts possible. And that has always been our model. And throughout the process of integration with the Medco business, we have refined that focus even further and aligned both of our businesses together to now the new Express Scripts, which continues that process.","With respect to Mail, unfortunately over the last couple years \u2013 not this year, this year has been a very strong year for us, good sales as you pointed out, a lot of the clients have been both in health plans and in the commercial area.","The sales season is still taking place, so we still have \u2013 it's a couple of the large employers that are still outstanding. But mostly it's the middle market that it still needs to be decided. And as you know this can go on all the way into \u2013 actually into early January for the very smaller of the group. But for the most part by the middle of November to the end of November decisions are being made, which can ultimately affect our numbers. But we are very optimistic.","After coming off the integration over the last few years, the team under David Queller is truly focused. What Chris Houston has done with respect to operations is truly remarkable, as we've turned the corner and got all of our business processes aligned to service the patients. And what David Norton is doing with respect to supply chain management really leads us to have a coordinated approach to how we work together to deliver our patients, and it's resonating. And sales are strong.","Give it a little more color, I'll just turn it over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Sure. Thanks for the question, Lisa. Obviously each client you win is a fairly customized experience. But the things I would draw from the significant success we've had this year relative to the last three particularly are a couple things.","I would start with leadership. The fact of the matter is we are at the table now because of the fact we have taken a leadership position on a number of issues and delivered on the words that we actually put out there.","If I go a little below that you've got to win on a number of things. And I would say the things that have mattered this year, and George hit on several of them, Formulary, driving value. And so we talk about pricing, but really pricing is increasingly a function of what are we going to do to help drive down costs and manage those appropriately.","The second piece I would say is this notion of alignment. Several places in the health plan space where our wins were driven in part with the notion that we were going to help those health plans in their market shoulder to shoulder to win new business for themselves.","The third is clearly the management of patients through Specialty in particular and being able to demonstrate strong commitments there and as well assure certain outcomes.","And I'd say the fourth is service commitment. And I would say our \u2013 a big thing for us this year is references. And so our book of business has seen what George just talked about in terms of our complete service recovery. And they are speaking to the marketplace about it. And it's very important as you know when you're bidding new business to provide references. And those references are done. And our references have been strong.","I think the last piece as part of service has been \u2013 almost every large case we've won have spent time in our lab. Have come in and shoulder to shoulder with us, with their leadership, seen the way that we attack new challenges and how we collaborate in order to do it. And I think all of that together produces a fairly compelling result for the right prospective client.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And I appreciate all that. Is there any way though just to kind of help us to frame those from a numbers perspective? Meaning for the new business that you won, did it \u2013 everybody take Formulary Management? Was it 50%? Like how do we think about it when we think about plan design in the bucket George talked about, Home Delivery, Specialty, Formulary Management for both renewals as well as new business? Is there a way, Tim, that you can frame that to say, the majority of clients who signed with us went with our Formulary? Or just anything that can quantify this in some way, as we think about 2016?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. So a couple things. And, Tim, feel free to chime in here. But so when we're out selling, there's a far different market in large employer groups versus medium to small employer groups and health plans. One of our challenges with health plans is that they often use multiple suppliers for Specialty. So although we may get the exclusive on doing the oral solids in the Mail, they still have \u2013 often have their own P&T committee. And they have \u2013 and they may choose different vendors as kind of an open hunting ground for Specialty.","So the idea is to get in and to secure it. Make sure that \u2013 and we have on all of our sales, have won a position at the table on Specialty. And now it's a question of our team working the doctor's offices, where we really again turned around our reputation and built our level of expertise, so that they're calling on the docs. They know that they're already \u2013 we're already servicing a bunch of their clients through many other clients that we currently have. And now we got \u2013 we tell them we just signed up with ABC corporation, and they are now a new client of ours. And so we're open to take their transfers and that for those patients as well. And that's mostly the way it works with health plans.","And we've had a very good success in that area, but we're never satisfied. We're going to continue to drive more and more as a percentage of those scripts to us. And so it's on day one, it's more of a challenge than it is on two years or three years into the contract, as we got to increase our penetration levels.","With respect to Formulary Management, there it's a little different with the \u2013 mostly with the large employer groups. They're buying into our Formulary Management processes and programs. Clearly with small employers that's the case. They sign up and they join in.","With the health plans again, they have their own P&T committees. And we're looking for \u2013 is alignment on key therapeutic classes. So you don't have to have 100% compliance with our Formulary Management. But what we do, with Steve Miller and Dr. [Glen] Stettin do is they line up with our clients to make sure that we're informing them about our Formulary Management programs. And then Everett Neville and David Norton go out and try to secure through economics the ability to align us together.","So I would say again on the employer side, it's mostly aligned in there. On the health plan side for us to win, just to be totally frank, it has to be mostly aligned. And that's what's really important to us.","And then over time as we drive greater and greater economics, our teams show up at the table. We show them the information that we have regarding the drugs that we're not aligned on. And we over time secure that and move it closer to our Formularies.","The other thing we do is provide a lot of detail behind the scenes \u2013 or I guess it's in front of the scenes \u2013 to their P&T committees to show the process we use to make those decisions. Dr. Miller runs that part for us. And so he's out in front of the clients on a regular basis talking that through. I don't know if, Tim, if you got anything else to add?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","No. I think that to sum it up I think George nailed it, which is on the employer side this year and the public sector side, pretty much 100% Formulary. Very heavy Specialty, us managing,","Interestingly we won one very significant health plan this year, and that was a client we had had through Accredo. And they saw what we were able to do with Accredo and have moved to much more strongly prefer Accredo. That's actually one of 17 installation. And what I would say is, except for Formulary, Mail, and Specialty, where we're actually working with them for one of 16, because those three areas they were compelled by what we could do for them, and they were motivated to actually move those more quickly. So I think again it's an N of one, but it's a good leading indicator for I think the way things are progressing.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","And, Lisa, I hear your comments and let us \u2013 we'll get with Chris McGinnis, and we'll see how we can give better transparency to this as we go forward. It's I understand your comments. And let us just see if there's something we can do here.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah, no. I appreciate that, George. It sounds like things are lining up well for 2016. I think all of us sitting on the other side of the phone today are just trying to figure out exactly what the wins and the retention mean as we start thinking about building out the financial model. So again I appreciate the comments, and we look forward to incremental detail.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, good morning. This is Elizabeth in for Bob Willoughby today. Growth in revenues per claim for the Mail business suggests further gains for Specialty. How do we think about the components there? What was the market growth? How much was share gain? And what was inflation?","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","We don't give specific details about the component parts. But let's just talk a little bit about some of what we incurred this year. We did have some high quality growth in terms of our Rx. Our Specialty business is doing quite well. And that helps drive like you say those quality scripts, so give you some good numbers.","Our revenue was generally in line. And again our overall scripts were absolutely in line as well. And we do feel we have strong growth in quality scripts, which is absolutely the key to drive our businesses. And as both George and Tim have indicated, Specialty, Home Delivery are two of our \u2013 are just key components in terms of driving our growth. And both performed very well in the quarter and have performed well in the first half.","Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And any color around what therapeutic categories were the big drivers?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","What I'd say is we've seen strength across the board. We have a very, very good super rare disease business that's the legacy, sort of a long-time Accredo business as well as some of the CuraScript business. That has continued to do well, as our service is just so detailed there and the payers completely value it. And the pharma companies have been very strongly supportive as new products have come out. But I would say it has been across the board.","And oncology has been very strong for us. Obviously hep C, I know people are trying to read through to see sort of what's happening. We've continued to see hep C, although certainly it's lapping numbers that were very high. And I would say the hep C contribution is probably marginally less as a percentage. I don't have the exact numbers, nor would we probably give it. But what I'd say is it continues to be an important part of our overall offering.","But no. The good news has been from our perspective, as clients want us to put these programs in place that manage these things, they are directing the volume to us. And so we've seen sort of the natural effects that are happening in Specialty with the pipeline and inflation. But we're also seeing increasing claims due to clients moving more of their business to us.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I think the important point there is twofold. One is we have to \u2013 we're focused on unit growth. But we're also focused on the alignment side of it.","So as clients \u2013 when a new client comes on board, especially a health plan as we talked about earlier, their formulary management may not be as aligned to ours as it will be over time. And so what our account management team does is, is they align it. The client savings go down, because we get better discounts from the manufacturers as we drive into the formulary management areas that we manage.","And then in addition to that the patient cost typically comes down. And of course then our values go up for our shareholders. So that's an important component.","So it's both things. It's not only getting unit volume, but it's also moving in \u2013 the other thing that happens of course is as generic drugs go \u2013 come to the market that actually drives down the revenue line. So the revenue line is always a little misleading, because it's not as much as it was three years, four years ago. But there's still a lot of generics coming to market, which has downward pressure on revenues but upward profits on profitability.","The same thing happens with Formulary Management. As we move from a non-preferred product to a preferred product, our discounts go up, so our revenues come down. But our profit margins increase, client savings increase, patient savings increase, and shareholder value increases. So the revenues are a little tricky in our business for that reason and aren't necessarily a good indicator of where profitability is headed.","Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then finally, how do we think about your competitive advantages in Specialty relative to other models that are out there? I guess why is this opportunity unique to Express Scripts?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well I'd say I think because of our focus again. We're not just here to fill scripts. We're not just here to take whatever the doctor gives us. It would cost us less money if we only took the script that came in the door, put in it a package, and mailed it out to the patient.","That's really not our approach. It's everything from helping that patient find whatever economic assistance can be had through PAP programs or through any other kinds of patient assistance programs that are out there. It's helping get people aligned to the right formulary.","When you're talking about a drug that somebody is going to be on for multiple years, it's really important that you get them started on the right product, because that's an annuity for the rest of their life. So if we can save somebody hundreds or hundreds or thousands of dollars a year, that's a lifetime annuity to that person. It's a lifetime annuity to that client. Because of our discounts it's a lifetime annuity to our shareholders, that person's lifetime, as we move people to the right drugs.","I think that's what differentiates us and makes us special in this space, is because we have that focus on that patient and on our clients and driving shareholder returns through our model.","Elizabeth Mary Blake - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Over the last two years you've touted the benefit from exclusion, $700 million two years ago, $1 billion last year before hep C. At this point you've demonstrated your ability to impact access. As we think about the 2016 Formulary, what type of role does exclusion have? And do you see the benefits of exclusion or your willingness to even in the areas where you're not excluding?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well that's a great question. And quite frankly we're still in the process. We're going to roll this out next quarter. And this will be a focal subject of ours on the third quarter.","You've made a couple of very interesting points. One is access. When drugs get extremely expensive, they can be life sustaining or make for a better quality of life. At the higher prices they're out of reach for many, many individuals through high deductible plans, doughnut holes, other odd things. There's just \u2013 it's harder for our patients to stay adherent and to stay in the programs.","And that's part of our Specialty offering. It's part of what we do every day in our Mail delivery and other areas, where we actually touch and feel the client or the patient. It's to try to make sure that we assist them in staying adherent or helping them reach out to opportunities that exist in the marketplace to secure financing if it's outside of their means. So when we do that we improve the access.","So although costs are going up significantly in certain therapy classes, our focus on that patient allows us to maintain access levels and drive better health outcomes for those patients.","With respect to our \u2013 with our Formularies like I said, we're still working them. We'll be rolling them out here shortly. And when we do that we will talk about that on our next quarter.","But the idea is to find those therapy classes where the competition is uniquely strong, and there's tremendous opportunity to move share. And we can do it with minimal patient disruption.","And when we combine those things together, it works wonders for our clients. A lot of HR departments have been scaled back, and so they don't have the resources they have, so they don't want a lot of noise. And we can manage these things with minimal noise, better patient outcomes, better client savings, and again better shareholder value.","Tim, you have anything you want to add?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","No. I think the only thing I'd add is we've clearly demonstrated to our clients and to pharma that we will make tough choices that minimally disrupt but maximally create value. And by virtue of having that track record of doing that and the scale and leverage to execute and the service and patient care to actually make it work for the client and the member, it gives us a very strong position as we come into 2016 to \u2013 the goal is always the same for us, which is to have every drug possible in the Formulary but at the right price.","And from that perspective you don't have to exclude a drug, because if the manufacturers in that class have made it worth your while to let them compete in the physician's office, we'll do it that way. If on the other hand we've got an opportunity to drive down costs significantly without impacting care, by virtue of an exclusion, we will \u2013 and particularly with minimum disruption, we will do that. Those same principles apply to what we're going to be doing in 2016.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And will \u2013 so we're just seeing what you have in store for 2016. Jim, one quick question, mechanic question here. The home conversion ratio increased this quarter. I know Mail was a little weaker than we had seen a year ago. Could you speak to what impacted that dynamic?","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Sure. As we went into this year we knew we had had some tough retention issues. And so we had some clients that \u2013 we had some losses that came into 2015. And as we reviewed those losses there was a bit of a disproportionate lean towards the Home Delivery.","And so we have been working hard to make up that hole. But that starts you out \u2013 again you've got to fill that hole. And it gives you a little bit of headwind as you begin to start out. So that's really what has affected the Home Delivery more than anything else. We have had \u2013 we've held our penetration rates really strongly. But again we started out in a little bit of a hole, and we just have to work our way through that as the year goes on.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","That's an important area for us. And in my mind if you look across the retail horizon, more and more people are taking advantage of Home Delivery, Internet sales. And I just think that is the future.","And that is our focus. We have the strongest, best assets out there. And the problem we've had that we've talked about on these calls in the past is the fact that for years Home Delivery was a mandatory Mail selling solution for a lot of our clients.","And consumer choice is really important today. And so we are investing heavily to change our model from one that was purely client driven for savings to being patient-centric and focusing on patient needs.","We've rolled out changes in our website. We have another massive change coming through in a month or so that's going to really make it much more user friendly and easier to navigate. The whole experience is being worked on and focused on. And I think we're making tremendous strides. But it will continue to be something we think is a very important vehicle for driving down cost while controlling health outcome. So it will remain a big focus of ours.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Appreciate it. My question was really the ratio. I know 3X is typically what we see, times the Mail scripts. It seemed to tick up this quarter. Is there \u2013 is it as simple as 3X? Or is there a change when you see lower Mail, higher Specialty?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it really is. It's 3X.","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","It's just that simple.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","It's that simple. It's 3X.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Sorry about that, Eric.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi good morning and congratulations on the quarter. Have a couple of questions here. First of all I mean obviously we've seen significant consolidation on the health plan side. And talk about just kind of optionality as it relates to pharmacy management. So, George, would love to hear kind of like your perspective on industry consolidation.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. It's \u2013 there's \u2013 obviously there's an awful lot going on in our space today. I think we are uniquely positioned for roughly 1.3 billion prescriptions. We have tremendous scale and size.","And I don't \u2013 again I don't know that it matters if you're at 1.3 billion or 1 billion, the idea is it has to be focused. In other words if I had a very disproportionate offering in Formulary Management we wouldn't be able to get the economics that we have. So scale is really important. And so when I look at all the consolidation that's taking place, it both offers us opportunity \u2013 it offers us some opportunity.","I think we've significantly improved our service levels with some of our biggest clients. I think that they have a \u2013 we have an opportunity to help them drive additional savings and value. I mean obviously when they run their own companies, they have to decide where they want to go and what they're going to do. We can't speak for any given client or what their future holds.","But I think our job is to make sure that we are presenting a unique experience with great economics that they really can't get anywhere else. And it's our job to sell that and demonstrate that. And I think we're uniquely positioned to do that.","So we're optimistic about what's taking place in the marketplace. And again we've built our company by aligning our interests with those of our clients. And I think that we can have a tremendous offering for any of the players that are out there that are looking for opportunities to improve their service offering, while lowering their cost.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","What \u2013 and what are you hearing from \u2013 because obviously we're seeing kind of like the consolidation of kind of like the large health plans. What are you hearing from kind of like your small to mid-size health plan customer?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry. What? Hearing from whom?","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","From your small and mid-size health plan customers.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Oh I see. Well it really depends. And again not getting into any into client specifics, but there's all different kinds of health plans out there. Some of them are Blues plans that are state owned that have very large shares in any given state with a very good offering.","And I mean obviously that when its competitors merge together, it makes people nervous, because your competitors are getting stronger. But a lot of these state Blue Cross Blue Shield plans are very, very strong and very competitive in their marketplace. So I think they feel good about their position on where they sit.","Other health plans are specialized to given populations. And to the extent they do that, they feel like again any time you see consolidation going on around you, it's a little unnerving. But at the end of the day if you have the right model and the right approach, you just keep sharpening your pencil and make sure you keep refining it and staying on top of it. And a lot of our health plans are specialized in their areas, whether they're part of a university, whether they're part of a doctor's practice. And so they have that focus, and they have their plans. And I think they feel very good about where they sit.","So I think that there's \u2013 you'll continue to see broad-based consolidation in our space. But I think there's always going to be a need for these Specialist players in given markets.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Yeah, Ricky, if I could add. I think a couple very specific things they are looking for, given how they compete typically against the larger ones. They are very focused on the physician experience in working with us, which makes our model very compatible to helping them in their local markets, particularly on Specialty. They're very focused on winning in their markets and keeping their sort of local clients. And again how we work together with them to do that, as well as to take and manage risk. And so increasingly we have conversations with them about how we use data in ways they may not be able to on their own invest in to help better assess and manage risk.","And then for those that are in certainly the regulated markets, they are very focused on Star programs if they're Medicare, and they're focused on the emergence of probable Star programs in other lines of regulated business, and how we can help them stay ahead of the curve there and get the full bonuses that they would want.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then one other question really more on kind of like just the 2015 dynamics. So obviously you raise EBITDA guidance, but you also raise kind of like slightly the SG&A range. So what gives you kind of like the enthusiasm? What do you think of the second half of the year? I'm assuming that the moving parts imply that gross profit are going to continue to go higher in the second half. So just can you talk a little bit about the moving parts of what coming from kind of like your GPO purchasing benefits versus other potential drivers?","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Ricky, I think that's a really good question. And I got to tell you there's lots of moving parts when we take a look at both where we've been this year and then where we're headed. We have \u2013 as you pointed out earlier we have had strong gross margin. And that's really an ability to execute and align with our patients, align with our clients, and just execute our model.","And we've done a terrific job, I would argue, of managing supply chain. We're buying right, we're selling right, we're doing all the right things when it comes to supply chain.","At the same time you take a look at our cost control. And as George pointed out earlier, our operating costs thanks to the leadership of Chris Houston and others has just been in line. And it has been moving in the right direction all year. And we believe it's going to continue to move that direction.","When you take a look at SG&A we are \u2013 we certainly focus on the component parts of our model. And SG&A is a special focus. We're willing to invest though in SG&A when it makes good sense. And as George pointed out earlier, you take a look at Specialty and when it comes to our attention, there's opportunities to invest in Specialty to improve our results, we'll do it. And the same holds true for Home Delivery, and it holds true for other aspects of our business.","So we feel that we've got a good handle on our expenses. We have a good handle on our model. And as we look forward to the rest of the year, sure we have challenges, and sure we're going to face some opportunities that will enhance our operating results and really give us a chance to demonstrate even further how strong the model is. But we have confidence that we can deliver. And we have lots of confidence in the way that the selling season has gone and really the way we've executed throughout the year.","So we feel pretty good about all the \u2013 each of the component parts. And therefore feel good about our guidance as we go forward into the rest of the year.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Oh yeah. Thanks and good morning. Maybe if I could just follow-up on the consolidation theme. George, it kind of feels like when you originally gave your retention guidance back at Analyst Day, I think it was sort of 94% to 97%. And now you kind of upped that a little bit. And you're willing to give fiscal 2016 script guidance. And so it's obvious you're feeling a little bit better about your retention rates.","And I'm wondering if could you comment on maybe what you're seeing in the competitive landscape, given the United [UnitedHealth Group] sort of Catamaran merger? Obviously you have all the MCO consolidation.","How is all this impacting your competitive landscape and your ability to sort of win new business? And then as you kind of look forward to 2016, does this sort of consolidation sort of make you feel better about your competitive position? Or does it maybe raise some level of uncertainty heading into next year?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Sure. And I guess the first thing I'll say is the turnaround in our business and the focus on our clients and improving sales really validates the decision I made to elevate Tim to President. I think it really does speak to his expertise and what he's able to bring to the table in getting the company aligned. So I think that was a very first, a very important step in moving us forward, and it's paying dividends.","As we \u2013 when we started the year we've had \u2013 we had some pretty big bruises coming out of the last two years. And obviously we didn't want to overstep our bounds. And so when we gave our original guidance it was our best guess coming off of a tough year. 1\/1 for us this year was a very strong one when \u2013 just to be totally frank it's the best 1\/1 Express Scripts ever had. It's also the best 1\/1 that Medco ever had as stand-alone companies. And together it was really well executed. And so that really added a lot of value to us going into the year, because clients coming off the previous year were feeling, still feeling some pain.","But 1\/1 this year, like all years, had a lot of moving parts, a lot of changes, a lot of Medicare changes coming through. And to the point we were able to execute on that, re-instill confidence in our clients. Plus very importantly it was the stability in our account management teams that service our clients that also allowed us to again build a better rapport and stronger relationships.","As the year has played out and more and more changes have occurred throughout our landscape in the healthcare industry, and new changes have to be implemented, we've done those for the most part flawlessly. And that again builds confidence.","And so with clients that we felt were at risk for renew, we renewed. And through that process we've been able to put the right foot forward and make some significant progress. So we're very excited about where we stand today in our model and how it's being received in the marketplace. And I think our new sales actually validates our position of our model of alignment and what we're doing in the industry.","The bold moves that Tim and I have talked about earlier are really important for our success. Anybody can go out there again and fill a prescription and adjudicate a claim. And we just \u2013 we don't want to be that type of a prescription benefit manager. We want to be somebody that's really affecting health outcomes and driving down costs. And I think us making bold moves, doing things for our clients that minimize disruption but drive economic value is truly important, and it's resonating.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And maybe just a follow-up on that. I mean the specific \u2013 the Optima-Catamaran combination, the MCO consolidation. How does that make you feel about the competitive landscape as you look forward over the next 12 months to 18 months?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well just to be totally frank, Glen, a lot of people picked our pockets over the last couple years as we've gone through integration. To be honest we're going to try to do the same.","And so we feel that there's some great opportunities out there. It's still early on. And so we're aligned and ready to go after them. And we're going to do our best and put our best foot forward. It's a very competitive environment out there. But we feel like our model is good and it resonates. So we're excited about the opportunities that all these consolidations are offering to us.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Maybe if I could just ask Jim one more, then I'll jump off. Jim, given the ASR could you maybe comment on when it's all said and done where that'll leave the leverage on the balance sheet? And what's sort of target leverage you're looking for the balance sheet? And I'm trying to really get a sense for maybe what the company's willingness is to deploy additional capital, whether it be towards acquisitions or a future share repurchase? Thanks.","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Sure, Glen. You asked a lot of different issues in there. And the ASR was certainly successful for us. And capital structure is important to us, as we give guidance for 2015 and frankly any year. And as we reported earlier we got shut out of Q1. So that ASR really got us back on track and incrementally will add about a nickel as we talked about in our release. And that's important to us, and that's good, and we acknowledge it.","As we look forward on the capital structure we've got \u2013 we're going to be right now \u2013 as we guided earlier, we're going to be probably a 2.1 times, 2.0 times on our debt. And I think that's a really good place to be. Having said that you also talked about the opportunity for acquisition. And I would tell you we look at acquisitions with frequency.","Every time one will come down the road we're certainly willing to take a look every \u2013 at every opportunity. And where it makes sense we're certainly going to be willing to jump in. We are not in the least bit concerned about raising that ratio if you will in terms of that capital structure, when it will mean good things to us. In other words as when we can take a look and see something that's going to be accretive and shows the returns that fit our model, I think again we will jump in with both feet and be willing to move.","It's important to us to keep our ratings. Don't get me wrong. But at the same time when we go through an acquisition or when we have an acquisition opportunity, and we can demonstrate what that payback is going to be. And it's going to come back within the ranges that are acceptable to us and frankly to the market, then we're certainly not afraid at all to move forward.","So we're going to continue to take a look at our capital structure as we take a look through the remainder of the year. We may look at some refinancing. We may have some adjustments there. But short of an acquisition I think we're going to keep our debt-to-EBITDA ratios about where we have historically been, again around that 2.0 times ratio. I hope that answers most of your question.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Yeah. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","And just one \u2013 let me just follow-up by just saying that one of the things I think we've proven over many, many years is that when we have excess capital, we return it to our shareholders. So whether it be through share repurchases or through accretive acquisitions, our focus is to manage your capital in a diligent manner to maximize returns. So that will always be a focus of ours.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions. I appreciate you guys aren't sharing a specific net new number today. But just looking at the 2016 script guidance and the updated retention, it does seem like you're on pace to at least offset losses from this year. So I guess first, is that directionally the right way to think about net new wins this selling season?","And then, George, I guess more importantly how much more opportunity do you see left at this stage of this year's selling season?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. That's a great question. So if you look at the midpoint of our guidance, the scripts will be down just slightly is our best guess, but it's not done yet. So we can't really tell you where it's going to come in.","There's not big \u2013 so insurance as Tim said, the managed care side is pretty much finished. We did have a large win he referenced earlier. We're picking up the Mail on that, and we're picking up Formulary Management. But moving a lot of scripts takes a lot of time and effort with a lot of plan design changes that have to come through. So that client in particular is going to start on 1\/1\/17, although we get some benefits this year.","As far as the clients that are still out there in the managed care area side, these are all for 1\/1\/17, and even that is starting to come more to a close on the larger side. With respect to large employer groups, that's really starting to slow down now as well. They're making their decisions, pretty much finishing up.","But the small employer group, which isn't a lot of claims, is what's really hot and heavy right now. So if we could be very successful there, it won't have as big of impact on claim volume, but it'll have a nice impact on EBITDA in the ensuing year. So it's a very big focus of ours. And it's something we really like, because again the smaller clients really do get into our programs in a bigger way. And they're very much aligned with us on trend management, Formulary management, and those types things. So it's \u2013 this is an important aspect for us. Okay?","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No. That's great. And then I guess, Tim, as a follow-up. I know I think you acknowledged during your prepared remarks we had the first PCSK9 approved recently. Just was curious to check in. Any updated thoughts on your intent to manage this class of drugs both now with just one on the market and then in the future? And I guess any thoughts around the label and price point of this first one to market would be helpful for us.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Sure. Obviously I think we're going to be shipping the first one before the end of this week. We've got programs in place for our clients right now, given that the first product that came out. Given the label, obviously that informs. And we pretty much were prepared for the label as it came out as it relates to managing our clients' appropriate use let's call it.","We're also very focused and very prepared as it relates to helping members use this product appropriately both through our PBM and through our UBC asset. And we obviously are engaged with the innovators, both those that have the product in the market and those that don't yet, to ensure that we can maximize access while ensuring appropriate usage.","And so when the second product comes that'll obviously be something that we are working on this summer to ensure the best result for our clients and our patients. And Glen Stettin is here. Glen, I don't know if there's anything you want to add or not? I know your team has been down very deeply involved in this.","Glen D. Stettin - Senior VP-Clinical, Research & New Solutions","Yeah. So while this is a drug that's really important to people who have heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia and haven't been able to get to cholesterol goals with the statins alone, the label is pretty narrow. And our PBM customers as expected wanted us to be sure to have programs in place to manage this drug from the very moment that the first prescription started flowing. And we have the programs in place.","The drug is a very expensive drug. And we are going to manage it so that the utilization is appropriate, the people who need it have access to it. That's what our clients need and want. But not more than that.","And at Accredo we're also prepared between Accredo and UBC for the education that people need to be able to take and use the medication. Our clients overall are going to be very pleased.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I appreciate your thoughts. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question from John Kreger with William Blair. You may ask your question.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. A question for Tim, and it relates to Formulary Management and compliance. Tim, when you sit down with a manufacturer, what's the number of members that you can point to that will comply with your Formulary changes? And how has that number sort of changed over the last year or two years?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","It's a good question. It varies obviously by class and size of Formulary. What I would tell you is though we get very high formulary compliance as it relates to our book. Particularly by the way \u2013 which is why I'm so bullish on Mail long term \u2013 inside the Mail channel vis-a-vis the retail channel. And so it's not unusual to see 90% plus.","And what's as important for us is our patients taking their meds. Are we keeping patients on an appropriate therapy versus having patients suddenly drop off, because the Formulary was too difficult to navigate? And we are very focused on that. And that's a large part when we talk with pharma, they want to know that not only we're going to move the share, which we \u2013 and demonstrate that we do. They make sure that we do by virtue of how we write our contracts. So believe me pharma holds our feet to a fire, as it relates to delivering on those share movements.","And importantly if you used for example the hepatitis C category, where there was some concern about the ability to keep patients on a regimen that may have appeared for certain patients a bit more complicated, we are seeing identical, for all practical purposes, adherence rates for those patients completing therapy to patients on other therapies that are available. And so we're doing our job well once the patient is on the right therapy. And pharma cares as much about that as they do the share movement.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","I think, John, the other point here is that your question is, how has it changed over the years? And when we came out with our first exclusionary list, because big pharma was going around us through coupon programs. And it was really hurting our ability to manage. So when we came out with the exclusion list, it really did bring a lot of focus.","And because we were able to execute that in some very expensive therapy classes and drive down costs significantly, that the buy-in into this has really grown.","And when we talk about the health plans having their own P&T committees and Formulary, but it's important to note what Tim said is that just because it may not be that all drugs align, on those that make a huge difference in cost, we can get alignment. And so when we go in, it really depends on the therapy class. When we go in with a significant amount of members in other classes it's not nearly as important, because the differentials aren't as great. So it really is aligning on those therapy classes that matter. And it has improved significantly over the years.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks, George. Maybe one quick follow-up, another topic in drug inflation. What are you seeing at this point across your book, sort of list inflation and realized inflation for your clients?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Well the \u2013 so it depends. On oral solids it's 10% to 12% typically. And on the Specialty it's 14%, 15%. That's list.","What we do is we fight through discounts and other means to get it down to single digits, to mid-single digits is our goal. It really depends on population changes for a client. No two clients are the same. So a client with an older demographic may face different challenges than a client that's a professional services firm, where the membership may be lighter, and they don't have retirees. So it really is different.","And our solutions have to be tailored to the demographics of the client. And so the way we measure is we take clients \u2013 when our comp teams meet with a client, we don't just show them \u2013 well we do show them overall drug trends. But the important point is, is how did that client \u2013 how did their actions and through plan designs, Formulary Management, and other things relate to other businesses in their industry?","And that's a key matter for us is to make sure that we keep our clients competitive relative to the rest of their industry, because that's what they got to compete in. So that's one of our key metrics for our clients.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Why don't we do two more questions? And then we'll call it a day.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning guys. Thanks for taking the question. George, I want to look at industry consolidation on the other side with retail pharmacy consolidation. And I guess you saw the CVS-Target deal, which is interesting. And how much more pharmacy consolidation would have to occur to impact your ability to implement restricted networks and kind of drive pricing and concessions on the retail \u2013 on the fulfillment side?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. That's a great question. It's interesting. When I started in this business back in the 1990s, half of all the pharmacies were independent. And if you had asked me as a CFO of this company back then, what was going to happen? And I look at what Home Depot and Lowe's have done. I've looked at what Wal-Mart has been able to accomplish. I would have told you that the independent pharmacy is a dying breed. And that they would ultimately vanish.","Today? Half the pharmacies are independent. And I think the reason is, is because you get a lot of entrepreneurial-minded pharmacists that go to work in retail. And when they come out they understand that they have an expertise and a connection to the clients and a following. And so once they get \u2013 make some money and have an opportunity, they quickly look to open their own retail. And although every year a fair amount of independents either get bought out by large retailers or go away through consolidation or whatever, next thing you know a new one opens up. And the numbers stay pretty consistent.","So one of the things that works really well in the pharmacy space is actually the fact that they do these group buying together. So that they join up with different pharmaceutical distribution companies to form buying groups that allow them to stay relatively competitive against the big players. So there's a fair amount out there.","You would think that maybe that consolidation would hurt us. It actually helps us, because the consolidation allows us to give an offering to specialize or to offer a specific chain in a given geographic area, where they have a large share and want more share of course. And be able to feature them to a given client, which allows them to give a very narrow network with better pricing. And try to capture more of the share in that marketplace.","So it actually works to our benefit for the most part through this process, because all of them are still looking for share. So it's a great opportunity.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then maybe just a quick follow-up for Jim. With the preliminary 2016 script guidance, could you kind of put a number on visibility to that number or certainty? And I guess would the remainder of the selling season indicate an upside or downside bias to that figure? Thanks.","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. That's a very difficult question, because what we tried to do is give you \u2013 steer you a little bit forward, give you some guidance on 2016 through a script count. And we've tried to stay within a consistent process and a consistent methodology. Last year about this time is when we first gave you a look into 2015. We're trying to give you a look into 2016 with a fairly consistent range in there.","I don't know that there's anything more specific that we can give you with regard to that. All the comments made today will tell you that we have a lot of confidence based on execution for this year and through the selling season this year, both results and frankly the welcoming we've received from both clients and prospects. And so again I don't know that we can give you anything more specific with regard to that. But again we just wanted to make sure you have a first look at least.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And the idea of a range of course is looking at probability adjusted downside and probability adjusted upside. And we try to put our midpoint in the middle.","So as we sit here today we feel good about our range with the middle being where we're looking towards. And we hope to beat it. We're going to certainly compensate Tim on beating it. And to the extent we don't, then Tim's income goes down, and he'll be a little less happy.","But we feel pretty good about the midpoint. We're going to try to drive to the higher end. But we can't give you anything other than the range today. And the midpoint's our best guesstimate as we sit here today.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thanks for the question. Good luck, Tim.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Let's do this last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Garen Sarafian with Citi Research. You may ask your question.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning guys, and thanks for taking the questions. One, a follow-up on a prior question. So could you maybe clarify what the major drivers are around the top end of the claims guidance for example? So is it \u2013 are you assuming an increase in utilization? Any view on what the top end captures regarding exchanges or in-group expansion, contraction, anything from that perspective?","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","Yes. So like I just said what we do is we weight adjust. There's still clients out for renewal. And so we've got to figure out where we stand with those.","Obviously as the year progresses we can become more optimistic about the renewal process. And so those are \u2013 our thoughts around that are weighted on every \u2013 each and every account. We do it from a top-down perspective. And then we do it from a bottoms-up perspective by looking at every client that's out there. And we make assumptions around retention. And then we look at the pipeline and prospects. And we do that as well.","One of the factors out there that are hard to get your arms around is this small employer group. And by that I mean clients that are 1,000 members or larger in that size of a range. Because a lot of those don't have what you would consider a normal pipeline. They're being sold through brokers and TPAs. And we don't have as much visibility there. But we still \u2013 but we know over history that a lot of these come to the market. And we've got to be out in front and make sure that we're working these hard.","And we just \u2013 at this juncture we can't give any better guidance than what we've given today. The top end obviously is driven by a stronger sales in that space.","But keep in mind that even if the numbers aren't that much stronger in that space, to the extent it's successful in its growth, the profitability in that space is disproportionately large. So it's important to us to grow it.","Now obviously if it's bigger and towards the top end, then it's going to be stronger and better. So we just got to play out the remainder of the year and see where this unfolds.","George Paz - Chairman and Chief Executive Officer","To the extent that if there's any other questions out there, if we didn't get to them all, we sure would \u2013 we would welcome you to please call Chris McGinnis. And we will certainly make ourselves available to answer any questions or comments or any issues that you might have.","We really look forward to this quarter's results. And we look forward to the turnaround in our business. We're excited about our future. We think with all the things that are going on in our space that our prospects are as good if not better than they've ever been. And so we're excited about where we sit, where we're at, and what we're doing to control costs and improve patient safety and health outcomes.","So I thank you all so much for joining us this morning, and I'll look forward to talking to you all soon. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you and this does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. At this time you may disconnect your lines."],"8563":["Express Scripts Holding (NASDAQ:ESRX) Q1 2013 Earnings Call April 30, 2013  9:00 AM ET","Executives","David Myers - Vice President of Investor Relations","Jeffrey L.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. David Myers. Please go ahead, sir.","David Myers","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me today are George Paz, our CEO; and Jeff Hall, our CFO.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our SEC filings.","For clarity purposes, all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables in our press release for reconciliations of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we will be discussing. The reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our earnings release. The release is posted on our website.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who will discuss our first quarter results.","Jeffrey L. Hall","Thank you, David. We've gotten off to a strong start in 2013. Integration efforts are on track, and we are meeting our targets. Earnings and cash flow were both up significantly from last year, allowing us to repay another $1.5 billion of debt and end the quarter with nearly $2 billion in cash. We repurchased 5.1 million shares during the quarter and increased guidance for the full year.","Looking at the quarter in a little more detail, Q1 earnings per share were $0.99. Adjusted scripts for the quarter were 390 million, in line with our expectations. Gross profit margin was 7.8%, up 70 basis points from last year's first quarter, reflecting higher generic utilization, supply chain efficiency and synergy realization. Gross profit was slightly ahead of our expectations.","SG&A was $542 million for the quarter, in line with our expectations. EBITDA was $1.6 billion and EBITDA per adjusted script was $4.08, up 20%.","Cash flow from operations was $963 million for the quarter. This strong performance, combined with $2.6 billion of cash flow in the fourth quarter, allowed us to prudently manage our capital structure. As I mentioned earlier, we repaid an additional $1.5 billion of debt, repurchased 5.1 million shares, finished the quarter with nearly $2 billion of cash and in April we purchased an additional $1.2 million of our shares.","As we look forward, we expect this strong financial and integration performance to continue. As a result of expected improvements in gross profit over the balance of the year, we are increasing our earnings per share guidance to $4.23 to $4.33, which represents growth of 13% to 16% over 2012.","As we noted in our earnings release and last year's 10-K, there are several factors that will cause our quarterly EPS trends to vary from historical periods. More specifically, we expect earnings for a large client to be skewed to the second quarter due to the structure of this contract. We anticipate this pattern of earnings to continue for the foreseeable future. The earnings from this contract were contemplated in our original guidance, and as a result, adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter are expected to be in the range of $1.08 to $1.12.","And at this point, I'll turn the call over to George.","George Paz","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Earlier this month, we celebrated the first anniversary of combining Medco with Express Scripts. In the year since we closed, we have made great strides in combining the best of each legacy organization. To date, more than 50% of our clients have moved to our destination platform, with high levels of client satisfaction. And we are on track to complete the migration on 1\/1\/14.","We are bullish on the PBM business and, in particular, our strategic positioning. Our differentiated and innovative offerings are resonating in the current selling season, and we are well positioned to help clients and members navigate the landscape in the wake of Health Care Reform.","Just last week, I met with many of our clients at our annual Outcomes Symposium, our first one that combined both legacy Express Scripts and Medco client. The feedback from clients was overwhelmingly positive regarding our expanded product portfolio.","We have brought together 3 complementary capabilities that enable us to uniquely address our clients' needs for better decisions and healthier outcomes. You've heard us talk about Consumerology, the advanced application of the behavioral sciences to healthcare. We've added therapeutic resource centers, which rely on specialized clinical programs and pharmacists to help patients make better decisions. To boast, we have a unique-capability, actionable data. We process nearly 1.5 billion prescriptions per year and cover approximately 1\/3 of the U.S. population. This unprecedented level of data allows us to analyze pharmacy, medical and lab data to enhance safety, savings and health outcomes.","Behavioral science, clinical specialization and actionable data form the foundation for something new and exciting in pharmacy benefit management: our proprietary platform, Health Decision Science. Ultimately, we're driving down costs, reducing waste and improving health in ways no other company can. This is truly a differentiator in the PBM marketplace.","The thirst for relevant innovation that addresses our clients' pain points is quite evident. This is especially true for specialty type therapies, where our clients are facing an alarming trajectory of specialty costs, non-adherence and significant waste.","Our clinical specialization and power patient intervention position us to close gaps in care and improve adherence, drive to the most cost-effective drug and encourage the use of the right therapy at the right time and at the appropriate quantity. Our comprehensive management specialty is once again a differentiator no other company can replicate.","As we think about the selling season, our focus on profitable claims growth is driven by 3 levers. First, retention. Our expanded product portfolio, success in migrating clients and stable economy management teams are resulting in one of our strongest retention years ever. Second, expansion. We are upselling our innovative and differentiated offerings to our combined book of business, and the prospects for additional upsells looks strong for continued success.","Third, new sales. As I said last quarter, we do not expect many managed care companies to change PBMs this year as they prepare for Health Care Reform. Employers are active in the marketplace seeking optimum value by constraining costs while improving health outcomes. We are uniquely positioned to meet their demands. While it is still too early to comment on this space, we are encouraged by the conversations we are having with many prospects.","We remain focused on executing our business plans. We've built Express Scripts in a thoughtful, strategic way with both acquisitions and organic growth. This has helped us to build scale and create an industry-leading suite of clinical tools to address the needs of plan sponsors and patients. This positions us well to win in the marketplace and to help our clients prepare for Health Care Reform.","In the past year, we've continued to deliver excellent service, built an industry-leading technology platform, developed the industry's leading suite of innovative solutions and we have been enjoying one of our highest client retention years ever. None of that is possible without a great team of employees fully aligned with our employees' best interest and focused on making the use of prescription drugs safer and more affordable. Our greatest differentiator is our culture and our people, and that is why I am so confident about our future.","At this point, we'd be happy to answer any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question will come from the line of Tom Gallucci at Lazard.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Two questions. Just first on the selling season, George, you mentioned strong retention thus far. Are you able to sort of quantify in any way for us what's your renewed versus what's up for renewal this year in your book?","George Paz","We are ahead of plan for where we usually are at this time of year, but it's still early. Like I said, most health plans are staying put. But they're still in the middle of the employer side, but we're feeling very good about where we stand. We're ahead of where usually are at this time with retention, and all signs are pointing to a very strong retention year.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe a second question, also customer related. Lot of thoughts out there in the marketplace around the impact of reform, both on your retiree base as well as maybe what your smaller and midsized customers might do regarding their insurance benefits. Could you give us any color on either of those 2 topics as you're sort of seeing it today and hearing from customers?","George Paz","Sure. Let's make sure we level set first in understanding of the business areas in which we sell. So we have large employers, Fortune 1000 companies. Then we have midsized employers, many companies that are anywhere from 500 to up, typically 1,000 to 2,000 employees or covering 2,000 members. And then there's also the small employer group, the very small companies, 100, 250, 10 employees. To break those apart, we operate in the top 2 of those segments, the large employers and the middle market. The small employers, we operate there, but we do that through our health plans. And what we try to do is position ourselves, and I think we are uniquely positioned, with an incredible group of health plan clients that pretty much give us a presence in every major geographic area for which new lives are entering the market or lives currently exist. So if a small employer happens to drop coverage, and they would be that 50 or less group, those aren't direct clients of Express Scripts. Those clients would normally be part of our health plan. But obviously, we want our health plans to grow. Our health plans are very important and vital to our long-term growth. Therefore, we work closely hand in glove with our health plans to help design products to meet those individual market needs. It's very early on. And if you think about it, we've got 30 million people coming to the market. On October 1st is when these programs are supposed to be rolled out. And there's an awful lot of uncertainty that exists in the marketplace today. I doubt if you'll see a lot of big shifts and swings in '14. I don't have a crystal ball to know that, but it just feels that way. Certainly, with larger employers and the cost of individual policies as they try to -- as we remove caps on coverage, as we require immediate coverage for individuals, to be an ASL client, which is the bulk of our direct book -- it's all of our direct book, those clients aren't all that interested necessarily, in going back to carve in if it's going to mean an insured product, which is going to be very expensive. That's not just what we're hearing or seeing. So I think it's still going to be cheaper for clients to stay carved out. And to the extent that smaller companies need to have insured coverage or a client does want an insured coverage, we can assist our health plans in delivering that. And there's been a lot of talk, I think, out in Wall Street about that more and more of these companies are carving back in. It's actually gone the other way. If you look at data over the last couple of years, what we've seen is that we've grown by about 8 to 10 percentage points in carve-out as more companies are carving out than carving in. And I think that trend will continue and will help benefit Express Scripts. One last thing I'll hit on, because I know I'm making this a long answer for you, but I'm trying to get rid of some of the confusion that's out there, is there's been some concern about EGWP. And when clients go to EGWP programs, so they just drop mail. Mail is a very important element for a lot of reasons. One, it's very cost-effective. Two, the clinical studies have shown that people are more adherent and stay -- have better health outcomes by going through the mail, even better than 90-day retail. And so when we move our clients from a carve-in plan to an EGWP program, we've had a lot of experience, there's several years of experience. We've seen no deterioration in mail order rates during that period. So mail order stays strong, and in fact, it can actually grow, provided we continue to work the right incentives for our clients and their members. So we're very, very excited about our space and believe we've got a lot of headroom ahead of us.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of George Hill of Citigroup.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","I guess, George or Jeff, you talked about the high level of renewals. I guess, can you talk about what percentage of the business you've renewed this year? And maybe any comments on that new?","George Paz","Well, like I just said, we're pretty early in the season. But keep in mind, a health plan -- we're already into April now, May in a day. And so for a health plan to move and gear up and take on Health Care Reform, that's tough. It's not impossible, but boy, that would be really tough. And if you've got to put your best foot forward and you're going to be monitored on service levels, giving yourself 6, 7 months and only a couple of months to open enrollment, that's a tough thing to incur -- to take on. So I'm not saying it's impossible, but I don't expect to see many more health plans change for 1\/1\/14. As far as employers, they can change up through the summer. We are in that process. We are working our sales side. I was just down at our Outcomes Conference. We had 800 clients at our conference. I think the level -- everything I heard, the levels of satisfaction were very high. Many of them have gone through our integration. The majority of those said that it was seamless. We're not hearing things in the marketplace. So we feel very good about where we sit and where we're positioned. And I think to the extent that we can show we can integrate while we continue to keep up with Medicare Part D, we are the right selection to go to as companies are thinking about all of the perils and tribulations that they look at in Health Care Reform. We are uniquely positioned to continue to deliver high-quality products on a more than timely basis.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","That's great color. Jeff, maybe a quick follow-up on the Q2 earnings impact from that large client, I know you guys don't like to talk about specific clients. I guess can you just talk about structurally what's driving -- with the contract, or the way it's structured, just what's structurally different about this customer or this contract that's driving the earnings change and the earnings impact?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Yes. I think as you anticipated, we usually don't talk about clients or really contract details, for obvious reasons. I think the important points are the ones we made is that as a result of how we structured this contract, and we structured it, the client and us are both happy with it, but as a result of how we structured it, we realized a higher percentage of the earnings in the second quarter every year. We expect this pattern to recur in the foreseeable future, and it's not new.","Operator","Next question from the line of Lisa Gill, JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was just wondering, as we think about the 2014 selling season, can you maybe just talk about what clients are thinking about, number one, around networks, narrow networks? Two, you talked a little bit about mail and how important mail is around your programs. And are you selling more mail into the accounts that have renewed for 2014? And then lastly, on specialty, what are you seeing around narrowing of networks as you start to think about 2014?","George Paz","I would tell you that from the specialty side, because of the high cost and because of the issues of non-adherence and -- it's everything from the vial size the doctor would use to prescribing habits, you could go on forever here, many things cause waste and higher cost in this space. And I would say this is at the forefront of narrow networks as using specialty networks has been very well accepted throughout the industry. So that's a leader in the area. I think that, combined with our little dispute about 1.5 years ago with a big chain up north, caused many people to understand that you can get by with a smaller retail network and have no noise. And clients are looking at that. And they're looking at many ways in order to figure out what makes the most sense from a network perspective for their own client base. We've been very aggressive in going out to our clients. We've given them a list of options. Depending on the client, so if a client has some economic issues that they're hurting a little bit for earnings, that they're trying to cut costs, if they're proactive with their employees and believe that having a broad open network isn't necessary to have a great offering, there's a host of clients and they can go into many different programs from a very, very narrow network, coupled with exclusive home delivery. And that's the situation. If you have exclusive home delivery, all you're talking about is getting your acute drugs to the pharmacies. You don't need as nearly as big of a network. And you've got that all the way up to Health Care Reform. Many clients, as they're looking at Health Care Reform, especially on the managed care side, believe it's going to be all about costs. The cost, the anti-selection, the cost of no caps and on and on, are causing policy levels to be higher than one would otherwise anticipate, or maybe I should say on a historical basis. And so to bring those costs down, to get those policies affordable, plans have been very open about narrowing formularies, narrowing networks, putting in step therapies, prior authorizations and a lot of other clinical programs in order to try to bring those costs in line. And we've seen more action over the last 2 years than ever, and it's on a continuing, increasing impact of those questions. And people now reach to us looking for innovative solutions.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","George, is there a way to quantify that? So if we think about all the things you just talked about, they're good for your customers. Clearly, it's a way that Express Scripts make more money and drives profits. Is there a way to quantify what we saw starting for 1\/1\/2013 versus what you're signing for 1\/1\/14? Are you seeing an increase in the upsell of narrow networks on specialty mail, et cetera? Is it equal to what we saw in '13? I'm a numbers person, so try to help me to think about it from that perspective.","George Paz","We've certainly seen an uptick, and so -- I'm trying to think of the best way to tell you this. Because you can leave out one given pharmacy chain. And is that a narrow network? You can get quite a better pricing in a given region if you have 2 or 3 chains competing against each other if I take one out. So we have many networks, many clients who leave a certain chain out. And that helps drive down their overall cost. We've seen a pretty nice pickup in exclusive home delivery. What we look at is profitability by client, and we look at the tools, which, of course, when we drive additional profits for our clients, we're also taking their cost down. And so that's our model of alignment, and it works very well. I would say all of our clients have some level of programs in place. Lisa, let me think about this a little bit and try to get back to you. I hate to leave it open ended, but there should be some way we can report out clinical programs and where we're at, whether it's networks and other things. I don't want you to lose track of that. Selling the right step therapy programs or our portfolio of those can be just as effective as narrowing the network. And so it really depends on the clients' demographics and where they're located and what the competition is. And so I could have a bunch of clients in a given area that aren't doing any narrowing of networks, but they could be all EHD. And that could be a huge home run for us. Likewise, I could have a bunch of narrow networks, but the clients aren't putting in step therapies or prior authorizations. And although that's good for us, the client can really save a lot of money if they put it in a clinical program. So I also don't want to mislead you. We've just given you raw numbers. We have to think about the efficacy of the programs.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one follow up. I'm very happy to see you start buying back stock within the quarter. Jeff, is there any update to that benchmark or any other metrics as we think about the guidance for 2013 now?","Jeffrey L. Hall","So as we look at our debt-to-EBITDA, we're standing at the end of the quarter, right at about 2.1x, and that does include the $2 billion in cash that we have sitting on the balance sheet. So we feel pretty good there. As we think about share repurchase, obviously, we're going to continue buying back shares. The lower the price, the more we're going to end up buying back. Current expectations, what we think the right metric here is what our fully diluted shares outstanding will be in our guidance range. We still think that's a 8 25  to 8 35, although probably closer to the bottom end at this point, based on the fact that we've started buying back shares earlier than we anticipated as a result of our ability to accelerate cash flow and really drive those metrics positively.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","\/>","George, obviously, it's still fairly -- there's still fairly limited visibility around participation and exchanges next year. But can you talk about how rates in the exchanges from what you're seeing so far compared to what you experienced in your book today?","George Paz","I'm sorry, rates in?","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","In exchanges.","George Paz","So you're asking about the rates that are the health plans are going to be selling in the marketplace? Or are you asking about our book of business?","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","On your book of business. So when you interact with the health plans on your exchange product, what kind of pricing environment do you see? And how that compares to your existing business today?","George Paz","Well, we have a suite of products we offer out to our clients that have different price points. And this is just another one of those products that has a price point. Obviously, the cost of Medicare and the cost of health care exchange programs are going to be more expensive because of all the regulatory interventions and all the stuff we're going to have to track and do report on. So there's a higher cost, but we also charge a higher fee for that. Obviously, it's different by client, so I can't directly answer the question.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. But overall, on average, it sounds from what you're saying is that the fees -- the rates are a appropriately priced to cover kind of like the higher cost. So when we think about your average book versus potential and new incremental business that you're going to pick up and the exchanges, from your pricing perspective, it sounds like it should be either at par or better?","George Paz","Yes, that's exactly right.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","\/>","Okay. And then, Jeff, SG&A in the quarter trended toward kind of like historical Express legacy levels. How should we think about SG&A spend going forward?","Jeffrey L. Hall","So as I said, SG&A in Q1, pretty much in line with our expectations. We do expect the SG&A for the year to be at or slightly above our original estimates we gave back on the fourth quarter call, as a result of increasing profitability. And we do expect the normal kind of seasonal ramp as we get into Q4.","George Paz","Just to add a little color to that, Ricky. Part of the reason SG&A goes up in our company is that when we set our targets, we set our management incentives at 100%. And so to the extent that we exceed our numbers, we have an opportunity here to earn additional compensation. That's why you often hear us say that SG&A is higher due to management compensation and that's because we have an upside to it if we succeed. Our shareholders come first, but then we share in that upside. So as our gross profit grows and profitability goes up, then we accrue additional bonus, which offsets that, partially offsets it, it doesn't fully, obviously, but it does cause SG&A to go up. Does that make sense? You got that?","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Yes, it does.","Operator","Next in line is Glen Santangelo of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jeffrey Bailin","It's Jeff Bailin in for Glen. If we're hearing your comments correctly, it sounds like the increase to guidance came from a bit of improvement in your gross profit outlook. Just kind of curious as to what you're seeing in the first quarter and the rest of the year that's driving that incremental improvement, particular kind of in light of 2013 being viewed as a lighter generic launch year?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Yes, as George said earlier, the new product offering we have is just resonating really well with our clients and we expect to improve margins as those clients get additional uptake and we, as a result, save our clients more money through the balance of the year. And we're also experiencing improving productivity in our operations. That's really the combination of those 2 things, which make us optimistic about growing gross profit above current levels over the balance of the year.","Jeffrey Bailin","Okay, great. If I could just ask one more. Your new prime vendor agreement is only about 7, 8 months old and there's obviously been some big changes and moves upstream in the channel. And as you look at your generic sourcing and potential other models, do you view the value of that increase in scale on a potential partnership as something that you might consider down the line?","George Paz","I was with a lot of our clients. And, obviously, as our clients looked at the merger of Express Scripts with Medco, they were wanting new tools, new opportunities, enhanced account management. That's part of the program, right? You put 2 companies together, you expect to be able to deliver more. When you put our ABC, our AmerisourceBergen, our vendor and Walgreens, a large sophisticated retail chain, I hope bringing these 2 companies together is going to add new buying power and new products to the marketplace. And we certainly would expect to take advantage of that. It's too early on to know yet what that offering is going to be, but it's a competitive world out there. So assuming they want to maintain our relationship and we're a big buyer, I would suspect they'll come to the market with good products and services.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Robert Willoughby at Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","George and Jeff, it looks like inventory management is taking a bit of a holiday here. Can you focus on what you're doing on that front to shrink those balances? And maybe what's the optimal level for inventories here going forward?","Jeffrey L. Hall","We've been driving cash really hard, as you can see, from the $2.6 million -- $2.6 billion of cash flow in the fourth and the almost $1 billion of cash flow in the first. So it's really been a full-court press to get cash in as quickly as possible so that we could deleverage as quickly as possible so that we could start buying back stock as quickly as possible. So towards those ends, we've really been focused on what we can do quickly and how we're going to get the biggest bang as quickly as possible. And that's been other than inventory, as you realized at the moment. We're also in the middle of consolidating the operations. We haven't quite made all of the footprint changes there. So we certainly have not forgotten about inventory. We certainly think there is opportunity to get back to historic Express Scripts level. And we will turn our attention to that in future quarters and hopefully deliver lower inventory levels.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Is that a '13 phenomena, Jeff?","Jeffrey L. Hall","It's probably early to speculate that on that. It's probably '13 to '14 as we get through the integration here. Obviously, we don't want to do anything to put the integration at risk.","George Paz","Bob, that's an important point. We've got United running off through the course of this year. So we've got to make sure we manage the inventories at the right level. Also, as you probably read, there's been several drug shortages throughout the year. And, unfortunately, when you see things like that coming, we have a group of people that only focus on monitoring the supply chain. And if we feel or if we hear that there's going to be a shortage in the industry, we are one of the biggest buyers of drugs out there. So we will over-buy in order to make sure that we're stocked up and can meet our clients' needs. The cost of not having the supply, especially in unique therapy classes, is not a good answer. So we do have to measure and monitor that, but the world's gotten a lot tougher over the last 2 to 3 years. And obviously, our size is much bigger, so having the right levels of cushion are important. But as Jeff said, we still have some work to do. And as you probably know, asset management is very important to us as a company, and we won't lose sight of that.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And George, you did reference you're getting access to the lab data from somewhere in support of some of your plans. Would you ever seek -- and where is that data coming from? Would you ever seek to fortify that source?","George Paz","We are -- through the acquisition of Medco, and Glen Stettin decided -- he's, we're fortunate to have him join our team as our product lead, and he was the brains behind the TRCs and he's big on the RationalMed program. And Medco has done a lot there in integrating. One of the problems you have when you have a vendor is that you're kind of biased towards their, whatever it is that they do. When you have a RationalMed type program, we see many, many healthcare providers. We see many, many lab companies. We see all kinds of companies that are providing medical data into the system. And by using our RationalMed, we have an unbiased approach to cut through a lot of noise and information to deliver high-quality products that are focused on lab outcomes, medical information and drug information. So this is a very much a very important focus of ours, and we'll continue to look at any opportunity that will enhance our offering.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","George, actually, I just you just want go back to some of the comments you made around your prime vendor agreement. I Just wanted to better understand. So as you look forward at this joint venture purchasing platform that exists between Amerisource and Walgreens and Alliance Boots, are you open to purchasing generics more through the wholesale channel as opposed to direct?","George Paz","What I'm really open to is making money. And so if you tell me I can buy cheaper from any way possible, more efficiently, manage -- going back to Mr. Willoughby's question, managing inventories better, if somebody is willing to pick up load or willing to pick up the inventory levels or drive down the cost or improve my cash flow, I'm open to any suggestion. To think that I'm the best at everything would lead me to an early grave, so I have to make sure that I'm constantly challenging our supply-chain people. And if any of our vendors are delivering a better answer, a better outcome, we are happy to follow their suit.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes a lot of sense. There's been a lot of discussion this quarter around reimbursement pressure from sequestrations, specifically as it relates to Part D specialty drugs. I was wondering how you see your specialty benefit services business positioned today. And are you seeing more interest in the specialty medical benefit management side of that business lately?","George Paz","Well, the specialty part of our business is probably -- it is the fastest-growing area of our business. And this is an area -- a question was asked earlier about narrowing networks, and by eliminating inefficient pharmacies out of the network by focusing on exclusive specialty with our Accredo model, and if you couple that with our clinical programs, we can significantly reduce. There was a presentation we did at the National Business Group on Health that showed how we could reduce overall specialty trend by 50% by putting the right products in place. So I think there's real opportunities for us. Sequestration really hasn't hurt us, but what it's done is it has opened a lot of doors for us because whether it's anything from the Department of Defense, all the way out to many of our clients, they're looking at ways to reduce cost in light of constricting budgets. And so we've got the tools, we've got the people and we've got the systems that I don't think anybody else in this industry has to deliver unique opportunities for them to save money, and we're excited about that.","Operator","We'll go next to the line of John Kreider with William Blair.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","George, another question about ACA. As you survey your employer clients, have you gotten any sense about how many of them might be considering a longer-term migration of employees to the exchanges if they work well?","George Paz","That's a great question, John. I remember going to a business roundtable meeting about 3 years ago or 2 years ago, and employers were not happy about the state of the union. We're in the throes of 2009 and '10, and costs were going up at a time when revenues were declining. The global economy was under a lot of stress. And there was a tremendous amount of conversation about offloading employees into exchanges. Go forward 2 years, those conversations really aren't happening in a unique way. Most companies don't just introduce a new product. They do a lot of testing. They understand the market they're entering into. They do a lot of -- make sure the systems are supporting it and we've got the right pieces in place in order to make sure it's a success. For an employer to come up today -- and I'm not saying nobody will -- certain very low-cost labor industries may in fact push their employees into it. But it makes sense because the government is going to pay a very high part of their cost through the subsidies. But if you look at most companies, they either have labor union contracts or have higher costs wages. You're probably fairly or pretty, very reluctant, I would say, to put your employees into something where you have no idea whether there's a net flow on them or not. And I think it's a little bit of a scary proposition. I don't see movement in any meaningful way in '14. '15, we'll see. We'll get a good handle on that throughout '14. Again, I think if they do move, we are very well positioned with our health care clients, but I just don't think that's going to happen for the next several years. I really believe that the cost of the policies -- if your employer pushed you out to the marketplace to go buy your own policy, you're going to be want to be made whole. And if you're using pretax dollars to pay for your health care today, and you're going to turn around and use after-tax dollars to pay for it tomorrow and you don't get a subsidy and you've got to buy a higher insurance policy and you've got the confusion entering the market, there's a lot of hands there that just are going to cause cost and confusion that I don't think employers necessarily want to have running through their organization. So I just don't see it, John, early on, but we'll certainly track it.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That's very helpful. Just one quick follow-up. Given your very upbeat comments about retention rate so far, what sort of a goal do you have for the year versus the 94% last year?","George Paz","Much higher than that. Let's not -- I probably would like to stay away from those percentages until we get to the next quarterly call. Because by then we will have locked down a lot more of the book and we'll be in a much better position to give a number. I do -- I will tell you that we are ahead of where we historical are at this point. So we feel good about this year and where we're running. And we'd love to give you some more color on the next call.","Operator","We'll go to the line of Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","When you talk of -- maybe going back to sort of an earlier question, trying to get a sense on how the uptick in a lot of your new offerings are, maybe another way to ask it is, George, when you look at your entire book of business, what would you say the penetration of your clients are to many of your offerings? And I guess sort of like, what is that white space available for the upselling as you look across currently?","George Paz","We have a lot of programs. We have many, many step therapy programs, many, many prior auth programs. We have anything from Select Home Delivery to mandatory home delivery to education about home delivery. So there's all different levels of choices. I would tell you that every client we have has some form of some programs in place. I would also tell you that the opportunity is probably as big as what we've actually implemented. In other words, we are constantly rolling out new programs. That's Glen's job that I referred to earlier. He looks at what's changing in the marketplace. The programs we offered last year are not the programs we offered 5 years ago. We may still be offering those programs, but there's new and enhanced programs each and every year. And so what clients do is they buy up, and then it's our job to look at not only at trend. And if your trend has been flat to low for the last several years but you put a lot of programs in place -- or a lot of our programs in place, now you're going to be subject to regular inflation and utilization trends, which means you're going to be getting up 5%, 6%, 7%. We can't let that happen. So Glen and his team's job is to come up with new programs. Tim Wentworth, who runs account management for us -- the client contacts, takes those programs and identifies the clients that we need to bring those trends down for and implements them. So again, because we're constantly rolling out new products, I would tell you that we have at least -- we have as much white space as we do used space. So we feel very good about where we sit.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","That's helpful. And just one follow-up on specialty again. Obviously, you're saying that the medical management in specialty is one of your fastest-growing parts. How do you deal with physicians in the sense that physicians have a lot of discretion, particularly with biologics, to make the decision what's prescribed? And how can you fit that kind of discretion into formulary management?","George Paz","Well, that's a great question. And you know that the physician is a very important element, especially in specialty products. There's rheumatoid arthritis, hemophilia, on and on and on. The physician, as you referenced, controls the patient for the most part. So it's very important that we're out in front of that physician group. We have a very large group of people that their job is to go out and talk about -- talk to the physicians. And we do a lot there. We don't only just only talk to them about the products we have and how we can manage the disease state. But we also talk to them about their prescribing habits and how they're doing and scorecarding them and working hand in glove with that physician to get better outcomes for those patients. So I think we have very strong programs. We can't just sit back and wait to see which patients are sent to us. We've got to be out farming those patients and getting them early on when they're diagnosed in order to give them the best treatment and give them the best health outcomes from the get go.","Operator","And that will come from the line of Steven Valiquette at UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You just mentioned United Healthcare a few minutes ago. And I was just hoping for a quick update on that transition, maybe from both the timing and the signing perspective, just color on that roll-off process so far in 2013?","George Paz","Well, it's absolutely on track with where -- they met with us early, and it's really -- I don't want to talk about the specific clients. So they came up -- they gave us a plan on integration on when they would move clients from our platform to their platform. Like a good company, they moved their own employees first and let them be somewhat the guinea pigs, and then they've been implementing the changes. We're following that schedule. They're on schedule. So we're just assisting there. And the guidance that Jeff has given incorporates their schedule into our numbers.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. I remember a couple of quarters ago you guys mentioned that transition could result in diseconomies of scale until it's fully transitioned. But I guess seemingly I would think that book of business is still profitable. So I guess I'm just trying to get a little -- just any help on whether this overall process kind of helped your earnings for this year versus kind of what the original thinking was or whether there's still diseconomies we've got to think about? Just any extra color on that, too, would be helpful.","George Paz","By definition, when you're losing scripts, you're not as efficient as you are when you're growing scripts. And so there are some of that. But we factored all that into our guidance and we put it all into our numbers. And we have a plan and we're working off that plan. So we feel very good about where we sit, and things are clicking on fine there. So I feel good about that.","Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us for our first quarter call. We look forward to talking to you in 90 days, roughly. And thank you very much, and have a great afternoon. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Please also refer to tables included in our earnings press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers that we will be discussing. This press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.express-scripts.com.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. As you've seen this past week, the healthcare environment remains unpredictable and volatile. At Express Scripts we are not distracted. Indeed, our focus has never been sharper, and that focus is being rewarded. Demand for our services continues to be high, our unique model is resonating and we are competing well. This is leading to a strong client retention year for 2017.","On the call today I will briefly discuss why we are positioned for growth, how we will deliver value to clients, patients and shareholders, important differentiators of our approach to specialty, our clients number one pain point and our unique attributes that fuel our momentum. Then I will turn it over to Eric who will discuss our solid financial performance and outlook for the remainder of the year.","Having a singular focus and a steadfast alignment with clients differentiates us. Plan sponsors today face a harsh environment filled with threats, but also with promise. We have an unprecedented level of innovation in the pharmaceutical industry. There are more drugs in the pipeline now than ever before and the majority are for specialty products treating chronic and complex conditions.","Without our leadership, in collaboration with our clients, this rich pipeline of high-cost therapies has the potential to profoundly impact healthcare costs. There have never been so many drugs coming out of the pipeline that are high-priced, prices once only seen in orphan conditions are now seen for conditions that affects millions of people, in diseases such as cancer, high cholesterol and hepatitis C. We are relentlessly focused on the patient, delivering the right drug at the right cost and creating a more rational net pricing environment.","Central to this in the long term will be competition from biosimilars. However, legal and regulatory challenges are impeding progress. We are working every day with regulators and biotech manufacturers to help them realize there is a market for these products. We have the assets that will ensure patients get on the appropriate therapy and remain adherent.","In addition to cost and complex regulations, payers are facing a population that is growing older, demanding more healthcare and wanting a greater say in how that care is delivered. We uniquely tackle these challenges and increasingly plan sponsors are turning to us, to control client costs, improve patient care and help plan sponsors maintain their pharmacy benefits, and do this through our innovative solutions, a single digital platform that integrates medical and pharmacy data, and specialized care delivered by compassionate people with deep expertise.","Now let me turn to how we deliver value through our independent focused model and our ability to practice pharmacy smarter. Being independent means being fully aligned with our clients' best interest. Alignment has never been more important than it is now. Our independent PBM model puts our patients and clients first and we tirelessly focus on lowering healthcare costs while delivering healthier outcomes. We are not encumbered by any specific drug delivery channel, we are not beholden to any specific pharmaceutical partner, we are not part of a bigger business. At Express Scripts our focus is simply on pharmacy benefit and management. That allows us to align fully and flexibly with the clients, do what's best for patients as we redefine the member experience, and work across the supply chain to drive out waste and create real value.","Next week, we will unveil our 2017 National Preferred Formulary. By aligning with our clients, we have been able to change the dynamic in pharma\/payor relations, reining in costs while sustaining access to drugs. Our approach has saved clients billions of dollars while delivering superior clinical outcomes. When you look at our 2015 drug trend report, I would point out that clients who tightly manage the benefit at a trend of 3.3%, in fact that represents nearly 57% of those clients. Plan sponsors are increasingly using a broad range of cost-effective innovative solutions to manage plans, and there is plenty of room to run across our book of business.","We advocate for what matters most to our clients. As I referenced earlier, in the past few weeks two biosimilars were approved by the FDA, yet today they are not available to patients. We continue to champion for biosimilars and for increased generic utilization. It will create the headroom payers need to afford breakthrough innovation.","Capitalizing on biosimilars will take the same kind of bold action we took when high-priced hepatitis C drugs threatened to decimate payer budgets. We stood with our clients and worked with pharma to lower the cost of care and expand access. We drove the treatment costs down by nearly 66% and delivered adherence and cure rates on par with both the clinical trials and the competing product in the marketplace.","Now the key to achieving this outcome in hepatitis C as well as outcomes across therapeutic classes is our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy. As most of you know, I am very familiar with our specialty business having previously served for three years as the CEO of Accredo. I recognize then what is still true today. Specifically, the difference that specialized care through our Therapeutic Resource Centers can make for patients and how our company will be rewarded for getting this area right for our clients. As specialty spend is expected to soon comprise 50% of total drug spend by 2018, we continue to enhance the high-touch service model we offer through Accredo while leveraging our scale and expertise to control costs.","No one is better positioned than we are to provide specialized care for patients with complex and chronic diseases. As I mentioned earlier, our specialty model is poised to get biosimilars to market and further accelerate our ability to manage specialty spend and trend. Our success in specialty is based on focused clinical management. Our continued growth is the result of our differentiated innovative offerings in the specialty space, which not only increases PBM client adoption but helps us win direct business from payers, physicians and patients.","Our SafeGuardRx suite of products is designed to better manage specialty spend, establishing a higher standard for patient outcomes. Payer's greatly improve their specialty utilization trend and overall spending by taking advantage of our cost management and patient care programs, seeing as much a 50% reduction in trend compared to those who do not apply our solution. In fact, I would point out the 3.3% drug trend for tightly managed clients, I mentioned a moment ago, is inclusive of specialty trend for those clients.","When you put it all together, Express Scripts is driving better retention, delivering strong sales performance, and building upon a diverse client portfolio by addressing payer challenges like no one else can. Therefore, we expect another excellent retention year. Because of our singular focus, consistent operational excellence, flexibility and our innovative practice of pharmacy, we expect 2017 retention rate of 96% to 98%, up 1% at the midpoint of the range when compared to this same time last year.","Additionally, I am pleased with our selling season. With our new suite of products including SafeGuardRx and our ability to meet the demands of today's complex healthcare environment, we are well positioned to drive new sales. We have changed conversations for the better. Our bold actions, specialized care, data insights and innovative solutions have created a deep connection with clients, and our success provides more proof of the value of our independent PBM model. Putting patients and clients first truly works.","I will now turn the call over to Eric to discuss our solid second quarter financial performance and the full year 2016 guidance.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. For the second quarter of 2016, we reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.57, representing growth of 9% over last year and in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Consistent with recent years, this quarter includes approximately $107 million of incremental revenue related to a client contract payment.","Other key metric highlights for the quarter include: adjudication of 315.3 million adjusted claims; decreased adjusted SG&A of 1% versus the prior year; EBITDA generated of approximately $1.8 billion; and finally, excluding the impact from the previously mentioned client contract payment, EBITDA per adjusted Rx would be $5.36, up 4% over last year.","Throughout my first year with Express Scripts, we've been focused on expense management and efficient use of capital. This includes our capital structure initiatives and our intentions to maintain an approximate 2 times debt-to-EBITDA leverage ratio and an investment grade rating.","As discussed in our press release, we executed a bond offering and concurrent tender offer to minimize our near-term debt repayment obligations, lengthen our portfolio's duration and to lock in attractive longer-term interest rates. Overall, we are very pleased with the outcome of this transaction.","Let's now turn to our 2016 updated guidance. Let me first touch on the adjusted claims guidance. For the full year, we are maintaining the midpoint of our current claims guidance at approximately 1.275 billion adjusted claims but narrowing the range. For adjusted SG&A, we are maintaining our guidance range. Cost efficiency is a priority for our leadership team. We continue our efforts to streamline our processes and make changes toward more automation. With our focus on technology, digital tools, home delivery and specialty, we expect to see operational cost improvements, a reduction in SG&A year-over-year and an increase in patient satisfaction.","We are maintaining our EBITDA guidance range at a range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, which represents growth of 3% to 5% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA. As we stated in the first quarter, while the growth expected in the back half of 2016 is similar to previous years, we are expecting a slightly higher ramp up in EBITDA throughout the third quarter and fourth quarters as a result of several factors.","First, the Q1 roll-off of business due to acquisitions was a headwind we had to overcome. And second, the growth over prior year in the second half of the year is largely driven by higher utilization of our cost savings programs along with generic launches, supply chain initiatives and higher Medicare Part D revenue, driven by the benefit design and reinsurance payments from the government.","We are also narrowing our adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance to a range of $6.33 to $6.43, increasing the bottom end of our guidance range by $0.02. This range raises the previously guided midpoint and represents growth of 14% to 16% year-over-year.","With respect to the third quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.72 to $1.76, up 19% to 21% year-over-year.","We are pleased with our financial performance year-to-date and continue to execute on our strategy to lower costs and improve health outcomes while generating shareholder value.","Thank you and now we'll be happy to take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill. Ma'am, your line is open. You may proceed.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much and good morning. Tim, just wanted to follow up on your questions, I'm sorry, around your comments on this year's selling season. You talked about retention, but can you talk about specifically on the sales side, is there a number that you're comfortable giving us? Are you net positive as you move into 2017, would be my first question.","And then secondly, you talked about a number of different value offerings that you have in the market, can you talk about what people are buying for 2017?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, Lisa. Thank you for your question and good morning. I'll start by talking just a little bit about the net positive question. So, as you know, we still have a range of retention out there. Our goal is to be net positive. In fact, our goal is to offset even the loss of Coventry next year, which again, as you saw in the release, there is still a little bit of that. But it's too early to declare that.","But you just need to know we're having a strong selling year. Things that we're winning don't happen to be the ones that you see out being announced, but we're very pleased with the way that we're selling. And a big piece of the reason that we're winning, as well as obviously retaining our existing clients, is exactly the point that you make, which is that we've got a number of things that we're out in the market with that are giving clients hope in terms of both some cost certainty, holding down their trends, keeping their patients on the products that are the most correct products, given the value they create. And so what I'll do is, actually Dave Queller is here, who heads up our Sales and Account Management. I'll let Dave speak specifically as it relates to the marketplace and kind of what you see in terms of uptake of the products.","David A. Queller - Senior Vice President-Sales & Account Management","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, Lisa. Lisa, we've had a very strong selling season this year, we're very pleased with where we are to-date at this point. As Tim mentioned, the clients are very focused on cost and adherence, and so we're leading in the marketplace with our SafeGuardRx programs, and very focused on what we have put in the marketplace to-date as it relates to the hep C programs and the cancer programs and our inflation protection. So that's got a lot of good headwinds for us, or a lot of help for us I should say, going forward.","The other piece, I would say, is that management of specialty has been critical and use of the TRCs, we see a very positive reaction in the marketplace as it relates to our management of the care and also getting patients the right drugs at the right time.","The last piece I'll talk about is the 90-day programs, we are focused on that and we've seen health plans have a larger uptake recently in 90-day programs, whether that be at the retail or more importantly, the home delivery. And so we've been really pleased with that too. And...","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Is there a way, Dave for you, or Tim or even Eric, because this is kind of a numbers question, to maybe just help us to quantify the percentage of your customers that are buying these today and what the white space, or market opportunity is? So would you say that when you think about each of the buckets, you think about specialty or SafeGuard, or any of those, would you say you're in the early innings or would you say a lot of clients have already adopted these kinds of programs? How do we think about that?","David A. Queller - Senior Vice President-Sales & Account Management","I'll take it, Lisa. I actually think for most of these, we're in the fairly early innings. I mean, SafeGuardRx represents a great chassis as do the programs that we launched in cardiovascular and in hep C, to build off of. We've already announced for next year diabetes and we're in the final stages of refining that exact program with our clients and with some supply chain participants, as well as the inflammatory conditions.","So we see this as still probably in the third inning of a game that could go into extra innings, quite frankly, because we don't see the dynamics changing dramatically that create the opportunity for us to uniquely work with the supply chain leveraging our book of business to create those outcomes.","So I think there's a lot of white space in condition management that bring a number of our tools together differently. So when you talk about Mail, for example, in the old days, this business, because of the generic wave largely, you drove the value of Mail because Mail was so much more effective at converting generics. Today the question is how do we work not only with Mail but with the retail channel, with 90-day channel, to drive the overall outcome in these condition management programs that we're launching.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And just one last one follow up, would just be, you noted that you're going to come out next week with the National Preferred Formulary for 2017. I think in the past, Tim, Express Scripts has talked about the value of the incremental savings that you can bring to your clients. Is there a number to think about for 2017 and the incremental drugs that you will be taking off of the formulary?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So, I'm not going to tell you that this week because we are literally still working through it. Believe it or not, these negotiations can take you straight to the brink sometimes. But I can tell you this: we target a material amount here, as you know. We try to do it with as few drugs. So I think that the big headlines are how much can we actually help drive out waste and how little can we actually disrupt patients in order to do that? We have been very good at that and I think what you'll see next week is, again, we're going to thread that needle very effectively.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. I appreciate the comments. Thanks, everyone.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Eric Percher. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I might move to a financial question for Eric. As I look at our model, our chief concern is relative to SG&A, and I know you spoke to some of the elements that are helping you control SG&A, but could you speak a bit more with more specificity to how much are we seeing benefits today from actions taken over the last year or two when you speak to cost efficiency? And as a priority, how much has been done this year? Because I know in the last two years we've seen second half SG&A higher than the first half. You really need to see a pretty large reduction to meet your full-year goal.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. So let's talk about a couple of things. One of the things that just to comment on last year, just as a reminder, in the second half of the year, a large part of that third quarter and fourth quarter was driven by incentive programs and in seeding our targets around performance of the business. So you have incremental incentive in there and we talked about that at year-end.","As you look at this year, particularly this quarter and if you look at the guidance for the year, the second half, a couple of things. One, we're still very focused on cost management. This company historically has always been and that is not going to change under Tim and my watch. So very, very focused. The front half of this year, we've continued to make investments around some of the things we've talked about, automation.","And so the other thing I'd point out in the second quarter is we had a few one-time items that won't repeat in third quarter and fourth quarter this year, particularly around a couple of one-time incentive programs, and then also increased legal fees around Anthem litigation. So that will certainly bring down the run rate and then we're going to continue to manage across the board our programs into the third quarter and fourth quarter, doing the things that we've previously talked about.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And so it sounds like we've got a couple of one-time items. But you would characterize much of this as efforts that have been put into place since the beginning of the year more so than long-term benefits from prior cost reduction efforts?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, it'll be both and we're not going to talk about 2017 until towards the end of this year, but we're very focused on both near-term\/short-term cost savings and longer-term cost savings management, and we'll talk more about the latter later this year.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And I would just add, as you can appreciate and Eric said it, but the back half of last year we took the opportunity to incrementally invest in things that we knew would drive out costs this year. And so that, a) was part of the ramp up last year, and b) is the kind of thing that's providing benefit in an increasing level, things like elective prior authorizations, for example, for the back half of this year.","And I have to point out that this team is, Eric said it, we are not losing our focus on cost. We're going to achieve the results that Eric has shared with you. And as you've seen, we've put zero dollars; zero, in any integration expense, because as we committed to you, we are done with that. And so we knew that was coming this year, we invested smart last year, we've got the management team that's got a lot of discipline this year and we feel very confident that we're positioned to deliver the back half strongly.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much. Yeah. Tim, just going back to some of your comments around biosimilars and your position to drive better adoption. I'm just trying to get a little bit more clarity on, are there things you can do near term with the formulary for next year to drive adoption of biosimilars that have been approved for the FDA? Or should we be taking your comments to be more of a longer-term goal?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I appreciate the question, Bob. First of all, what I'd say is, unfortunately, and I think that's probably the best word for both our clients and for us, it's unlikely that we're going to see anything next year. And my comments were made very much more to frame what we believe the longer-term opportunity is going to be and the position that we sit to be able to grab that opportunity and help deliver it for our clients and for the patients.","But understand also that my point would be the mechanisms by which we will deliver those are the mechanisms that are delivering value today because we recognize that we're working at the state level as well as at the federal level to help folks understand that we will get these products to market, that we will do it safely, that they can create a significant amount of headroom for payers.","And so when we go in and we have these conversations, we recognize the timing may not be until 2018 or 2019 or even beyond, but I'm reminded of when I joined this business in 1998, we were looking at the front-end of the generic wave and we were at 40-some-percent generic dispensing rates and we're at 90% now and it was back then that we needed to be able to begin to educate the marketplace, make sure we were aligned with clients to deliver that value and have a business proposition. We're very much in that position now.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And I guess just a follow up, one of the areas you guys talked about contributing to improvements this year and I think even more so in the back half was the digital initiatives. And I guess one area that we would've thought would see some improvement in as a result would have been the mail penetration. Obviously in the quarter down about 180 basis points year-over-year, down slightly sequentially. How are you thinking about your ability, given some of the ongoing initiatives, to drive better mail penetration going forward? And how important is driving better mail penetration to the full-year expectations you guys have?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","So the good news for us is we're very committed to the digital transformation of our member experience, because that's how members want to work with us. It's how we drive down costs. And what you'd see if you were inside the company is a couple things: one, you'd see significantly increasing net promoter scores on the part of members who work with us; two, you would see that that's a big piece of how we're driving down costs and waste from taking out phone calls that members, frankly, don't want to make to us because they want to self-serve, and we're seeing that. That is the sort of leading result of those investments.","The lagging results of those investments, as members experience it and work with us, particularly as we put our omni-channel 90-day programs with clients that are both mail and retail is we've been able to contract with the supply chain and the retailers in such a way as to make that something that works for us and our clients and our patients is that over time we're going to see it grow.","In the quarter what you would've seen, or frankly his year what you would see is the roll-off of Coventry was largely their commercial book of business which did have mail penetration and that's largely the driver that was actually creating what you saw in the numbers that you put out there. So we're very confident in the long term.","I remember the old days when we used to say that a generic at mail was three times as profitable as anything else, at least in the company I was working for at the time. I can tell you now, that dynamic has leveled out to a far greater deal. We have a much more balanced approach to how we actually are paid in alignment with our clients to do our job. And so we are committed to mail. We believe it's a channel that members want to use, but it's not a channel that we are solely dependent upon for the kind of growth that you would expect from us.","Robert Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Garen Sarafian. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I wanted to take the selling season from a different perspective. Given the M&A activity within managed care and the recent announcements by the DOJ, I'm wondering what changes you've noticed in the selling cycle heading into this year, so we can see what it might revert to as the recent views get digested by clients, even if they're still not entirely resolved. So have clients been holding back on certain RFPs that may now go out sooner than anticipated? Or were they lengthening or shortening the duration of their contracts? Any comments on that front would be great.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","That's an interesting question. What I would tell you as I sit here and think about it is, no, we have not seen clients \u2013 clients are so focused on managing things right now year to year and evaluating the marketplace for the best solutions, that they don't have the luxury of sitting and waiting for the DOJ to make a set of decisions. I think that as I think about our position in the selling season this year and next year, in my opening comments that's why I sort of referred to our singular focus and our ability to innovate now rather than \u2013 we went through our merger and acquisition 4.5 years ago, right. And you saw what we went through. It's hard. Looks as if at least those may not happen, but I can tell you that the payers are focused on what you can do today for them, and we've not seen any of them holding back or sort of changing their approach to creating a very competitive market for us to play in.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That's useful. And then on Accredo, one of the opportunities I thought I've heard mentioned in the past is to better sell Accredo as a standalone specialty pharmacy, which could be used even if Express Scripts wasn't the PBM. Could you elaborate on that aspect of selling season and how that's progressing versus prior years? And, of course, quantifying it as much as possible?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure, so as you know, we don't really give the separate result there, and even when we used to in the old days, we didn't break it out by direct versus PBM. What I would say is this, we continue to compete well in what we call the direct marketplace, where essentially Accredo is either the specialty pharmacy for someone who is packaging that with other offerings to the market or in network as one of two or maybe one of three. Typically that's what we see. We continue to see both the retention of that business as well as new opportunities there, good bolt-on, in some cases for singular therapies where we have deep expertise or across therapies. And so I'll tell you it's an important part of our business, particularly in the more rare disease space where we have just a commandingly excellent service model for those patients, PAH, hemophilia, designs and so forth. And it continues to be an important part of our overall strategy for growth.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Kreger. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Just to come back to the SafeGuardRx programs, Tim, on the inflation front. What are you seeing in the market now, not in your own managed products, but just curious are you seeing any changes in inflation across generic, traditional brand and specialty brand?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","What I'd say is pretty much what you've seen is what we've seen, which is generic inflation has been very low to next to zero. Our clients have experienced good generic results over a lot of years because of our ability to negotiate on the mail side and then bring that into our retail negotiations. But in the brands, what you're seeing is continued \u2013 and you really have to dig in and look at it product by product and manufacturer by manufacturer to understand the overall dynamic and what's inside of it. But we're certainly still seeing inflation that has our clients focused, that has us with a job to do, and close to, I would say, the double-digit rate again this year, probably between 10% and 12%. And probably, right now at least, it looks like at the high side, recognizing we've still got quite a bit of the year left.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","So when you sit down with prospective clients and talk about your inflation guaranteed products, what sort of differential do you think you can deliver?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","It's multiple percentage points. The real point is we can take the lid off of that and, again, recognizing depending on the client's mix of business, mix of products, what kind of patients they have and so forth, it varies from client to client, and that's how we write the program, in terms of the value it creates. But it's multiple percentage points of difference. As you heard me say in my prepared remarks, we hit 5.5% across the book of business on our Drug Trend Report roughly and 3.3% for the highly managed clients. And what we've defined as highly managed is clients that are taking four of our programs and inevitably one of those programs is for the upcoming year and the results that we put out, which we think are going to be very strong again are going to be those that are in that Inflation Protection Program.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks, and one last one, Eric. Can you just talk to the operating cash flow metric. It was down year-over-year. Just what drove that? And have your full-year expectations for cash flow changed at all? Thanks.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes, so certainly full year has not changed as we've maintained that guidance range. If you look year-to-date, I believe, we're just slightly above last year. You have to go back to the first quarter when we were well ahead of expectation. And I commented on the call in the Q&A, a lot of this is around timing of payments and receipts and we had receipts in the first quarter that came in just a little bit ahead of time and would've otherwise been second quarter items. So it's kind of hard to look at it quarter-to-quarter. I would stay focused on the year-to-date, which we're right in line with expectations and again our annual number, same thing, right on line with our previous expectation.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes, thanks. Thanks for taking the question here. Tim, you talked about the changing value of mail over time, and clearly as you mentioned earlier, the real driver in the past was generic conversion. As we really kind of approach the tail end of this big wave of small molecule generic drugs, is the specialty portion really the main driver in the mail channel? And how do you view the rest of the traditional mail business in the small molecule space going forward?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Look, first of all, there's no question that as our clients look down the barrel of specialty being half of their spend that it's a critical part of how we're going to maintain both the trends in spend and adherence and outcomes and everything else that the clients need from that channel.","But what I'd say is mail still has an important role to play. By the way, there is still some pretty terrific generics coming forward, as you know, in mail. Obviously retail has done a much better job in the last few years than they did back in the day in terms of converting those patients. But mail begins to add to its allure, the fact that people just like getting things by mail.","And so we've got a great clinical benefit there. We think our therapeutic resource centers continue to be important differentiators. We continue to see mail achieving outcomes that are differentiated even from 90-day retail channels, and so we are still committed to that. But I think it's one thing in terms of what you're paying in the markets, another in terms of how big is the problem that it's solving in contrast to the overall problem? And simply put, specialty is an increasing opportunity for the work that we need to do, and therefore relative to mail, has become more important.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","And just a follow up, you talked a little bit earlier about some digital initiatives and things like that. Can you talk about the patient experience, the user experience right now with dealing with mail? I think in the past people have often commented that mail is a little difficult to get started. Once you're started, it's fine, but getting signed up can be a little bit cumbersome. Can you talk about how things have changed here in terms of getting people signed up earlier? And what's the average turnaround time for the first fill, typically? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, first of all, interestingly enough, the turnaround time for the first fill is a really important vector. When we look at net promoter score and break down what are the key drivers of net promoter score, and so that's a piece where we've lopped off over half a day and we continue to lop off time for that first script coming from mail.","We're also absolutely trying to make it easier to do. Obviously, we're in a highly-regulated business, both at the state level and the federal level. So there are certain things that you might be able to do in other businesses that we have to figure out that not as easy, in terms of, for example, taking a picture of a script, which you can do certainly if you're then going to go into retail because you're going to present the paper script. But we have to have the physical script or the electronically prescribed script before we mail it. So e-prescribing very important part of our strategy. We continue to see that grow.","Digitally, we've started using our digital welcome kits, which means it's a time that a member enrolls with us and we already have their data, we can actually present opportunities to them through that enrollment process in our welcome kit that used to be a paper thing that everyone threw out. And so while it's early days and we're going to wind up re-versioning that, doing what you would expect us to do in terms of digital A\/B testing and seeing the things that work best to help members navigate to mail, we see in the long run that that's a channel strategy with members ought to at least present the opportunities to them in an easy-to-use way, so that those that want to use it will access it.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. You say you've lopped off about half a day in terms of turnaround time. So what would be the average number of days for the first fill typically now in mail?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, the challenge \u2013 so your question implies challenge, which is it depends. As you know, more and more prescriptions come with prior authorizations today because that's how both the Medicare plans are managing and the commercial plans are also managing on top of more narrow formulary management. And so it depends is the answer. Where we're able to get the script electronically, do an e-prior authorization and so forth, the patient can expect that script in probably three to four days.","And, by the way, part of the goal as well is patients are happier when they know where the script is than when they don't. And so one of the things we've done is opened up a black hole that if you'd ordered from us four years ago, you'd know that we got your order and that's all you'd know until you receive it. And now, we've become much more communicative with our members in whatever channel they want us to communicate to actually keep them informed of that. And so the timing is important, but managing of expectations is equally important and that's what we're seeing.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. Robert Willoughby. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Tim, is there a rule from the United experience or otherwise just in terms of helping us think about Anthem possibly transitioning away? Is there any type of rule how much business, like employer carve-out business you think you could retain in that eventuality?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","You know, the short answer is there's not because you have to look at the book of business that one had versus the other, how much of it was likely to be carved out. What we've been more likely to do, Robert, when we've seen some churn in the marketplace is try to help our health plan clients win lives and carve them back indirectly. And obviously, that overlap is something that we have not looked at yet, if I'm honest with you, because all our energy has been spent on servicing Anthem's members and positioning ourselves to be their best choice when they reach the point of needing to make a choice in pharmacy. Obviously, the question was would they or wouldn't they be integrating another pharmacy into their own or into us or into something else. And that's still all to be played out. So the short answer is I wouldn't bet a large amount of the pie on that, and I frankly have been spending my time thinking about, again, what are other things we can do to help them win and grow.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","You obviously had some challenges with the integration of the Medco business. Was there an experience with United as they transitioned a lot of their business back? Or that was just Medicare business, I guess. We can't really point to any success retaining accounts?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No. I would agree. I wouldn't point to anything there that would be material.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Tim, in your prepared remarks, it sounded like you were explaining to us the value of independence. So as we've seen some of the contract changes that have happened with United winning a lot of business or a decent amount of business for CVS, what are you seeing in terms of the traction that you're getting with that message that there is value to the independence of the model?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, it's showing up in our retention obviously. It's showing up for us in our sales. I've read several reports that also spoke to the fact that the market is looking for a competitive PBM offering that delivers value. In this business, one of the constants over my 18 years has been that the independent model has been very successful. Obviously, I was part of one that wasn't and then when we became independent, it unleashed us to be able to do our job really, really well. And I think it just makes our conversation very, very straightforward and, more importantly, all the assets of the company that come to the table in the form of our account rep or our sales rep are aligned around this one thing. And it really just drives a very, very deep singular conversation. Our clients see when we're in Washington, D.C. or at the state level advocating things, we're only advocating things that are in their interest in pharmacy. We aren't advocating anything else. We aren't talking about anything else. But all of that makes us feel good. Our job is to make it come to the table in terms of retention and new business wins.","Now, the other thing I'd say is there's always been folks that like certain models. There are certain PBMs that are small that you look and you think on a pure scale basis they shouldn't win a single case, but they find a marketplace for themselves. There are buyers who will choose based on different criteria. What I can say is the buyers that are choosing on criteria around aggressive management, around taking care of their members and trying to continue to provide the benefit to help their members through a consumer experience as it relates to the plan design and navigating the choices that are being thrust onto those \"consumers\" as it relates to plan design, those buyers, which are a significant number in the marketplace, like our model a lot, because we really are aligned to them. There is no question that we are creating competition in parts of the supply chain including retail and pharma, and so from our perspective it's a great unencumbered model.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","And, Tim, as a follow up to that, shifting to the Health Transformation Alliance, it's something that was written up obviously this weekend and some of your investors are looking at. So how do you envision that alliance of employers and you're offering basically co-mingling or co-existing in the market?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I think that actually there's a lot we can do to work with those clients in the Health Transformation Alliance. In fact, many of those clients know what we can do and have brought that to the table. We actually are engaged with them. We have a very good dialog with the HTAs directly as well as importantly, our clients that are in there. It's been out there for a while, as you know.","Again, it's one of those things where if you go back to 2005, there was the Transparency Coalition that got started. We adapted our model to that and it's been extraordinarily successful for us and for that coalition, and those clients that wanted that sort of a model. That's again, from our perspective, the ability to be flexible, the ability to create value for clients. I think as I told a client around that, if all of the clients we have in HTA are willing to do certain things together, that only gives us more ability to create value for them, whether that's around indication or outcomes-based pricing, whether that's around a different rebate model, or anything else.","This business has always adapted and we see things like the HTA to the extent that it gains true traction in working with those clients. And of course they have a number of things they're going after, but we love the fact they want to be data driven, we love the fact that they want to really drive outcomes that are good for their clients and keep their clients in business. I think the big story that didn't come out of that is those clients want to stay in the business of providing benefits. That's right down our strike zone.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Thanks for the comments, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Mr. Ricky Goldwasser. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. A couple of questions, but first starting with the big picture. One, Tim when you took on the CEO helm, you talked about taking a fresh perspective, it expresses strategic assets. So can you maybe share with us a little bit when you look at your assets portfolio, what do you think you still need to add to it?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you for the question, Ricky. First of all, I think one of the things that that we started even before George left, but on my watch, with the team that is so terrific at my table, is this notion of really rethinking how we engage with the supply chain to create value, and leverage our clinical focus.","And so this notion of condition management programs, with an umbrella of inflation protection over it, is extraordinarily innovative. We don't see anybody else doing it at scale the way we are and taking on those challenges.","We started it by launching it in front of 600 clients and Dr. Miller standing up and essentially signing them up to empower us to go out and do something that hadn't been done before around sort of an indication-based pricing model in oncology. And we built off that and it is transformational as it relates to the conversations we have with pharma, with manufacturers and with our clients.","That being said, and so we like and think we have the assets to get it done in terms of continuing to create that value. But as we look out, we see areas of waste and so forth in areas like worker's compensation, we see that there continues to be more we can do in specialty to broaden our footprint. We see healthcare information technology, particularly for payers in assessing risk and managing risk and potentially for providers, as areas that would naturally leverage our DNA.","And so those areas that we're now looking at, and what I would tell you is we are much more engaged than we were while we were integrating, as it relates to looking at opportunities outside of our four walls to bring additional solutions to our clients in those areas.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And when we think about how you think about balancing that in additional buybacks, is that sort of a formula you're thinking about it?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So what I would tell you is, it is not either\/or. We have enough flexibility and enough ability to do both that I'm not concerned. And certainly, obviously, the share buybacks right now have a very high return to us, so they create certainly a high standard for any acquisition to hit in terms of our strategic thinking around that acquisition. But let me be really clear that we are not doing share buybacks at the expense of otherwise taking advantage of diversifying somewhat our EBITDA base and solving problems for our clients that go outside of our current core. So in that respect, I guess our capital priorities are not changed at all and, again, they are not either\/or.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then just one follow-up \u2013 and thank you, Tim, for that. One follow-up for Eric on the SG&A in the second half of the year. I mean obviously an important part of the earnings trajectory, but are there additional swing factors in the second half that we should be thinking about outside SG&A?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","I guess, within SG&A really none other than the things I've talked about before. So it's managing our costs, managing the trends. There's no big items that are going to drive that. It's across the board, across all of our organization. If you're referring to outside of SG&A, it was in same things in my prepared comments that are going to drive the ramp in EBITDA in the second half.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of George Hill. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, guys and thanks for taking the question. Tim, I have a question about alignment in specialty. You guys talk a lot about how well you're aligned with the clients. A piece of feedback that we get sometimes is that the PBM is still incentivized to fill these high-cost specialty scripts and payers seem more concerned about appropriate utilization. I guess, so can you just talk about straddling the line between kind of the script filling in here and managing utilization appropriately? And I guess, can you give us an example of how you contract around that alignment such that you're getting paid and creating value whether or not you fill the script? That would be helpful. Thank you.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. I mean, first of all, it's clear. The way we report to clients, they have a front row seat for the job that we do in specialty. And I would just point out that the vast majority of patients, in fact, that are on specialty scripts need to be on those scripts. There's value that is created. The question is are they on the lowest-cost and most appropriate script and that's why we've been able to move formulary into specialty as aggressively as we have, which was not something that was being done largely in the industry as recently as three years ago, and certainly not at scale.","And so number one, making those formulary decisions and contracting with manufacturers to create and bring to our clients real value around that, contracting in such a way as to allow the price to be rational and allow us to do our job. So let me give you an example: PCSK9s. When you take a look at PCSK9s, to your point, as just a retail pharmacy or a fulfillment pharmacy, we're incented to fill every script we get in PCSK9s. That's not the way it works. And what we've shown our clients and where we sit today is in the first year while those products have been out, we have basically taken the majority of the scripts that came to us, let me use that number, and wound up actually speaking with the physician and moving the patient out of the PCSK9 class in terms of their therapy because of the fact that we managed it to the label, we managed to the indication, we got the tests that were fairly sophisticated in terms of the kind of data that we needed to get, and we managed it. And we've shown our clients that.","We put it in a program called the Cardiovascular (sic) [Cholesterol] (52:13) Care Value Program and we basically guaranteed the PMPM cost that they were going to experience for PCSK9s and then we hit it. And we didn't just do that recklessly because patients that should be on those drugs \u2013 those are fabulous drugs \u2013 are drugs that we want to get and keep those patients on. But again, in the early days, the docs really were not writing in such a way as to target those patients highly effectively and we've helped train those physicians through those conversations while making sure that the patients that needed them got them. That's probably the best and most recent example I can give you, but I can tell you across the piece that we contract with these companies to create value for our clients and then we deliver it.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","If I follow-up on that example, Tim, can I ask the question, between the prior auth, the contacting the doctor and then moving that patient, let's say, off the PCSK9 to generic Crestor, can you guys make more money through the prior auth process and that whole redirection process to the generic than you would have on the PCSK9?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Nope. We don't actually. So what we \u2013 I couldn't charge that much for the prior auth, I wish. But we are paid for that. But again, we work with our clients to make sure that we get paid the way they want us to be paid and there are a number of ways in specialty that that happens. But that's part of doing our job. We can't make money on \u2013 it's not about dispensing a drug every time it's being sent to us. It's about getting it right and, over the long term, that's what drives our retention, that's what drives uptake of our other products and services, and it's what creates a total envelope of value that we're able to participate in with our clients.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Mr. David Larsen. Mr. Larsen, your line is open. You may proceed.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey, Tim. Can you talk a bit about your relationship with Anthem? Has the dialogue or the relationship improved in any way now that the DOJ has apparently blocked the deal with Cigna?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","So thanks for the question. What I would say, David, is that that just happened last week, and I'm sure that there are whole bunch of things that Anthem naturally is going through. As I said before, we're not going to do a blow-by-blow or play-by-play sort of our conversations with Anthem. What I would say is this. We're working really effectively with Anthem to help them put in programs that help manage cost and drive their business. We're providing really strong service to them. Our teams are working well together. I don't have anything more to report than that at this point. Obviously, we still have a lawsuit between the two firms that they filed and that we've counter filed on, and we are in the very early innings of that game, barring any change of position on their part, of which I'm hopeful and which, again, I believe the best way to position ourselves for that is to just to continue to really drive great value to them through these programs that we're putting in place as well as taking great care of their members.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay. Operator, we have time for one more call, please. This will be the last question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Tim and Eric. So I guess for me, I think every key topic has been touched on at this point, but just to follow-up on that Health Transformation Alliance. It wasn't really clear from the article just the mechanics of how that alliance is going to create savings in pharmacy and it sounded like from your comments they're not really intending to bypass PBMs or go into the PBM business themselves. Are they just trying to pool together their buying of PBM services? Is that kind of the essence of it?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I mean, I really would say you need to talk with them to go deeper. It wouldn't be right for me to speak on their behalf. What I would say based on the interactions both with our clients and with them that we've had, is they are \u2013 and what they've said publicly, they're agnostic as to providers. They recognize the need for providers to sort of enable whatever it is they want to bring to life. I think we've worked with different coalitions for years and years. How this one plays out, we'll follow their lead. We'll show them sort of some ideas that we can do. I agree with you though that even in the article, which was really a stew of interesting sort of different, sort of mostly previously written things that were being brought together to form a theory that, frankly, doesn't exist, was very much around this notion that these plans are focused on maintaining coverage, using data to get smarter, understanding how the dollars flow. Those are all things that we do really well.","And I can tell you, we've been willing for years to write deals and many, many of our contracts, for example, have rebates of 100% flow-through, completely auditable. The article implied that that doesn't exist. And so again as the Healthcare Transformation Alliance focuses on their pharmacy pillar, of which they have four pillars based on my understanding, we look forward to working with them because it would appear what they want to do is work with the marketplace to drive additional innovation, and that's our DNA. And so I actually think we can find some very interesting ways to help them achieve their goals.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. The other real quick piece in the article, it just talked about that the members of the alliance can control drug benefits by separating PBM services of like claims administration, mail order and specialty pharmacy. It seems like to me unbundling that would lead to more costs, not less. I'm curious to get your quick thoughts just on that blurb in the article as well, if you've got an extra second on this.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, sure. I mean, I think it remains to be seen, but generally speaking, I agree with you. I mean, I think that what you've found in the marketplace generally and it's true both in our channel as well as health plans as well as other businesses, right, is I just bought my wife a car. They bundled a bunch of stuff together and it was a lot cheaper than me going through the pick list and it put together something that was what we wanted. That's our job in the case of HTA and with every other client is to bundle together what they need us to do. It doesn't mean they have to buy everything. It means that we believe that we can configure our model in a way that's good for us and helps the client meet their needs. And if they want to, for example, internalize some small piece of what we do because they'd like to do that, we have clients today that do that, in the health plan space for example.","What I would say though is, most of the HTA \u2013 well the HTA's clients are employers, they've got a lot of things to do, they got businesses they're trying to grow and focus on. And from our perspective, typically what employers have found is even when they have asked us to respond to bids that had discrete lines of business, almost inevitably they've come back, and this article actually spoke to that, they've come back and moved back into a more integrated model.","But then they understood sort of what the individual cost pieces were and got comfortable with the bundle. And I fully believe that we're going to continue to see the market, particularly the employer market, continue largely down that path for the foreseeable future.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, got it. Okay, thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay, I think with that last question I want to thank everyone for dialing in today. We appreciate you calling in. Look forward to talking to you next quarter as we share our results in the marketplace and in running our business. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference.

With me today are George Paz, Chairman and CEO; Matt Harper, our interim CFO; Dr. Steve Miller, our Chief Medical Officer; and other members of senior management.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our filings with the SEC.","For clarity purposes, all financial numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables included in our press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we will be discussing. The reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our press release. The earnings release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website.","This presentation will be posted on our website and includes an appendix with footnotes in the reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted numbers and EBITDA to net income.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to George.","George Paz","Thank you, David. Good morning, everyone. Today, we will cover 3 topics. First, Matt will review our third quarter performance and provide an update to our 2013 guidance. Second, Dr. Steve Miller will take a deeper dive into one of our clinical programs, formulary management. Formulary management is one of our key initiatives that leads to better decision, healthier outcomes and lower cost to our clients and members, while contributing to longer-term growth for our shareholders. Third, I will provide a business update including a discussion around health care reform and private exchanges.","At this time, I'll turn the call over to Matt.","Matthew D. Harper","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Our third quarter results demonstrate solid operating and financial performance. Notably, client migrations remain on track, having migrated more than 80% of our clients with high levels of satisfaction. We generated $1 billion of cash flow from operating activities. We deployed $751.5 million of cash to repurchase 11.6 million shares of our stock. We continue to make progress in bringing our income tax rate back to historical Express Scripts levels, which added $0.01 to our earnings per share in the quarter. We delivered $1.08 per share in the third quarter as a result of our financial performance and a lower tax rate, and we increased the lower end of our full year earnings per share guidance range by $0.04.","Looking at the quarter in a little more detail, adjusted prescriptions for the quarter were 358.1 million, in line with our expectations. As anticipated, claims volume was negatively impacted by the continued roll-off of the UnitedHealth Group business.","Overall, other key metrics for the quarter were in line with our expectations. EBITDA was up 3% from last year and EBITDA per adjusted claim was up 13%. While the table reflects change on a year-over-year basis, I want to take a moment to discuss growth on a sequential basis.","Excluding the revenue from a large client that was skewed to the second quarter, all metrics showed improvement. Gross profit margin was up from 7.8% in Q2. Gross profit per adjusted claim was up 4% from Q2, and EBITDA per adjusted claim was up 4% sequentially. Included in the year-over-year decline in gross profit is the continued roll-off of UnitedHealth Group claims and the inclusion of Liberty's gross profit in last year's numbers. Liberty was sold in the fourth quarter of 2012 and is not included in this year's results. Notwithstanding these items, gross profit per adjusted Rx increased to $5.81 for the quarter, up $0.34 or 6% over last year. The decline in SG&A expense reflects efficiencies gained from integration of our Medco acquisition and the inclusion of Liberty's SG&A in last year's numbers.","We do expect SG&A expenses to increase in the fourth quarter as we prepare for new client implementations on 1\/1 and health care reform.","As I previously mentioned, we generated $1 billion of cash flow from operations during the third quarter. As we discussed last quarter, our cash flow for the year has been impacted by the timing of payment cycles for the legacy Medco business. Part of our integration efforts include migrating Medco's legacy payment cycles to be consistent with Express Scripts.","We continue to make progress on migrating these cycles. However, we now think some of the cash flow benefits may be realized in early 2014 and not 2013. Therefore, due to this timing delay, we are adjusting our cash flow guidance range to $4.0 billion to $4.5 billion for the year. Our year-to-date cash conversion ratio stands at 1.4x GAAP net income, which is a healthy measure for cash generation.","During the quarter, we repurchased 11.6 million shares for $751.5 million, bringing our year-to-date purchases to 24.9 million shares for $1.6 billion.","We expect to continue our share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter, exceeding third quarter levels. We have 51.3 million shares remaining under our current repurchase authorization program. Over the long term, we expect to maintain our current debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2x and return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders.","We are increasing the lower end of our guidance range by $0.04 as a result of continued solid operating and financial performance, including integration successes and the benefits of the lower tax rate expected for the year. We now expect full year 2013 adjusted earnings per share from continuing operations in the range of $4.30 to $4.34, reflecting growth of 15% to 16% over 2012. Based on year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of $3.21, this equates to a fourth quarter earnings per share range of $1.09 to $1.13. As outlined in the table, there are only a few other revisions to the guidance we provided last quarter. We are reducing depreciation slightly as a result of fewer projects being placed in the service during 2013. In addition, our effective income tax rate is now expected to be approximately 38.5% for the year.","On our second quarter call, we discussed our longer-term growth drivers and provided a framework for delivering long-term growth. We described the near-term potential in formulary management, home delivery, specialty pharmacy, network management and generics, which will create over $10 billion in client savings, generate $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in EBITDA for Express Scripts and contribute to our targeted long-term earnings per share growth of 10% to 20%.","During the first quarter of 2014, we will hold an Investor Day, which will take a deeper dive into all of our growth drivers. For today's call, we want to discuss our formulary development process and describe the changes we are making to our National Preferred Formulary in 2014.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Dr. Steve Miller, our Chief Medical Officer.","Steven Miller","Thanks, Matt. Due to environmental factors continuing to pressure our clients' drug trend, Express Scripts mission to make drugs safer and more affordable is as important as ever. With a generic fill rate that exceeds 80%, branded prescriptions still represent over 70% of our clients' spend on pharmaceuticals. Branded drug price inflation is growing at double-digit rates every year. When you add that to health care reform and the requirements of the essential medical benefits package, increasing specialty cost trends, direct consumer advertising and copay cards, plan sponsors and patients are looking at significant challenges in controlling drug spend.","These marketplace factors provide an important opportunity for Express Scripts to assist our patients and clients in lowering health care costs while driving better clinical outcomes. Obviously, our tools and programs to control costs are needed now more than ever. Over the last several years, we have successfully held down pharmaceutical costs by moving patients to lower-cost generic medications when possible, influencing our clients and patients to take advantage of lower-cost mail and retail network alternatives, assisting clients to manage the cost and quality of specialty care and developing innovative clinical solutions and plan designs to coordinate care, improve health, close gaps in care and lower costs.","Our formulary management tools are a fundamental component of controlling drug trend to offset many of these environmental factors. Before discussing the formulary changes we are implementing for 2014 with our National Preferred Formulary, I want to provide background on our formulary development process. At Express Scripts, we are very proud of our unique model in creating our formularies. Our National Pharmacy and Therapeutics Committee or P&T Committee is made up of 18 physicians and a pharmacist who represent both academic and private practices and come from across all the major subspecialties. They receive a stipend from us for their time, but none are employees of Express Scripts. They are fully independent. In fact, when a member leaves the committee, it is the committee that picks the replacement, not us. The other really unique aspect of the work is that their decisions are binding on the company, and they are not allowed to consider the cost of medications, only the clinical aspects of the drugs.","The P&T Committee considers all new drugs when they come to the market and all drugs on an annual basis. They make a determination of which of 3 categories the medication should be included. The first category is clinical includes. These products produce better outcomes, are unique in the market and must be included on our formulary. About 15% of drugs get into this bucket. At the other extreme would be clinical excludes. These products, while still in the marketplace, have no role in modern therapy and, thus, are excluded from the formulary. Less than 1% fall into this bucket. Therefore, 85% of products are determined to be clinical optional, that is, they can be substituted for by other drugs in the same category. An example would be penicillin. Our P&T Committee would demand that we get penicillin on the formulary, but they just do not believe that one is better than any other and it's up to the company to decide which to include on the formulary. How this process works is graphically demonstrated on this slide. The process begins with the P&T Committee's clinical determination. Second, an internal value assessment committee evaluates the optional drugs as recommended by the P&T Committee for net costs, market share to make a formulary design and placement recommendation. Next, the P&T Committee reviews and approves final formulary placement recommendations to ensure clinical appropriateness. Finally, we put in place support tools to minimize disruption and assist members, pharmacists and physicians to get patients on the most clinically sound cost-effective medication.","We accomplish this through a passionate team of pharmacists and patient care advocates who help patients through a one-on-one discussion, as well as an innovative team exploring prescription processes to provide the safest, most efficient and most convenient way to deliver medications to our patients.","Our National Preferred Formulary is now the largest formulary in the United States with more than 30 million members. We deploy this scale to negotiate deeper rebates from pharmaceutical manufacturers on behalf of our clients. In addition, the introduction of multiple brand drugs in a therapy class has provided the opportunity to encourage competition between pharmaceutical manufacturers for exclusive and preferred physicians on our formulary. This, coupled with the environmental factors described earlier, has driven us to be more aggressive in the design of our 2014 National Preferred Formulary. For the first time, we are recommending the plan sponsors exclude some drugs from coverage. We're maintaining a 3-tier structure, with the first tier, generic medications; the second-tier is preferred brand; and the third tier is non-preferred brands. However, we are now excluding 48 specifically chosen products, which means they are not included in any tier on our formulary. We maintain clinically equivalent lower-cost alternatives for every one of these excluded products. Our approach fundamentally changes the industry dynamic with pharmaceutical companies because access on our formulary has even greater benefit to them as it ensures larger market shares.","Thus, most pharmaceutical companies are shifting more dollars to the tightly managed benefit design. However, to combat our formulary design, pharmaceutical manufacturers use a variety of tactics. This includes copay cards. These cards are used to encourage the selection of higher-cost brand drugs, which unnecessarily drive up plan sponsors' costs. Because we are not covering these 48 products, 93% of which have copay cards, the cards cannot be used as a secondary form of coverage. Additionally, 5 clinical categories of excluded drugs were for specialty medications. This has resulted in dramatically increased rebates in the involved specialty classes and will have a long-term benefit to controlling specialty spend and inflation. By excluding these specific 48 products, which do not offer any incremental clinical value relative to other alternatives remaining on the formulary, we're impacting just 1% of the drugs included in our 2014 National Preferred Formulary. This will subsequently impact only 2.6% of members, which will all have access to clinically equivalent lower-cost formulary alternatives.","These changes result in over $700 million in annual savings for clients on our National Preferred Formulary. We believe this strikes the right balance between member impact and client savings, with the result being an approximate 3% reduction in our clients' costs for branded drugs. We are receiving great interest from clients on custom formularies, including health plans and large commercial clients, in what we're doing with our National Preferred Formulary and would like to piggyback on it. With our unmatched skill and expertise, we are uniquely positioned to manage clients' costs, create additional value in the pharmacy benefit, by driving to a more narrow formulary, our process prioritizes clinical outcomes that provide the best economics for our patients, payers and shareholders.","At this point, I'll turn the call back to George.","George Paz","Thank you, Steve. As Matt referenced earlier, we remain on track to complete our client migrations by 1\/1\/14, and have already moved 80% of our clients. Integration remains one of our core competencies. We move very aggressively to consolidation -- to consolidate adjudication platforms, rationalize our product offerings and optimize our organizational structures and footprint. This approach minimizes overall disruption for our clients and positions us well long-term.","We are encouraged at both our migration progress and the market's response to our combined offerings. As the selling season winds down, we continue to enjoy solid performance. Our sales and retention results remain substantially in line with our Q2 update. We are also encouraged by the pace of up-selling our innovative offerings to our combined book of business. With all the uncertainty and complexity surrounding enrollment in the public exchanges, we will provide 2014 prescriptions and earnings guidance with our fourth quarter results.","Based on discussion with our clients, we believe most employers are taking a wait-and-see approach to health care reform. Therefore, they will continue to offer health benefits to their employees. For newly insured lives and those employers who choose to drop coverage, we are well positioned through our health plan clients to successfully win lives on any public exchanges. Our health plan clients have a presence in approximately 40 states, representing about 90% of the available lives. Due to demands on plans participating in public exchanges to opt for affordable premiums, our health plan clients are increasingly taking advantage of our product offerings, including aggressive home delivery programs, narrow networks and formulary management tools to drive down premiums and attract membership.","The impact of the Affordable Care Act and, specifically, the impact of the exchanges on PBMs is receiving significant attention. While health care reform in an aging population will drive some change, including the millions of uninsured Americans who will obtain insurance coverage, overall, prescription coverage remains fairly stable.","On health plan clients -- our health plan clients provide us access to regulated markets such as Medicare, Medicaid and exchanges. These are high-cost, complex and fast-growing markets. Due to this high cost and complexity of maintaining compliance with federal and state regulations, our scale and continued investment on our regulated solutions provide a competitive advantage to our health plan clients. The other area of health care which has generated significant headlines recently is private exchanges. Currently, private exchanges represent less than 0.25% of prescriptions in 2013 and are projected to reach approximately 2% by 2016. While the long-term success of private exchanges remains unclear, PBMs will participate either through our health plan offerings or directly through pharmacy-only solutions. Due to our scale and product capabilities, we are well positioned to grow with our health plan clients and the public and private exchanges.","To summarize our third quarter performance, we delivered solid earnings results of $1.08 per share, increased the lower end of our guidance by $0.04, launched 2014 formulary management strategies to save our clients over $700 million annually, successfully migrated over 80% of our clients with an anticipated completion on 1\/1\/14, and continue to see a strong market response to our differentiated product offerings.","Operator, at this point, we'll be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is going to come from Glen Santangelo from Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, I just want to follow-up with some of the comments you made regarding the private exchanges. There seems to be a lot of concern amongst the investors that a lot of the employers are going to migrate to these private exchanges. Could you maybe give us a sense for how your conversations with employers are going, and what your sense is in terms of what they may do? And then as a follow-up to that, I'm kind of curious if you could talk about sort of your pricing methodologies within both the private and public exchanges, because I think the investment community is clearly nervous that the profitability within these exchanges will be a lot lower than your traditional employer and managed care contracts, and so if you could comment around that, I think it'd be helpful.","George Paz","Sure, thanks. Thank you, Glen. First of all, I do get to spend a lot of time with many CEOs across the country. The commercial book represents a very large component of our overall business. And it would be misleading if we said one-size-fits-all is the simple answer to this equation. Like everything else in business, cost controls are extremely important to companies. So companies look at any way they can to reduce cost. But on the other side of that equation, quality components of a product are equally important to any employer. In other words, if you're making cars, you need the best designs, the best components and produce the best car. Likewise, if you're in a service industry or other components, you need great employees. At the end of the day, employees are the most important asset any of us as employers have. The drive initiative and passion of our employees to meet our needs and the needs of our shareholders and, in our case, patients and others, clients, is a critically -- a critical component of success. So let's take it apart a little bit here. If you have a very low wage, low-skilled employee base, the private exchanges offers a decent option. The reason that occurs is because many of those individuals when they go to the marketplace, they will receive a subsidy. If you think about an employer who's providing health coverage to a large group of low-skilled, close to minimum wage or slightly greater employees, the health care cost can be close to or equal to their overall compensation levels. So to relieve yourselves of that burden, you have to make the employee whole. If you're going to enter the exchanges, and the exchange then can offer a benefit, which basically is subsidized by the federal government, then the cost has gone down for both the employer and the employee. Those are the ones we think when we talk about growing from 0.25% to 2%, I think you'll see that. On the other hand, if you've got a high wage base, high wage employee base, and you're dependent upon their skill set, if you just turn off the coverage, what ends up happening is you have to pay a penalty, a non-tax deductible penalty, which is quite expensive then when you tax-effect that penalty. In addition to that, those employees then must go out to the marketplace and try to buy coverage. The reason most large employers use ASO plans is because they don't want to pay the cost of risk coverage. And so the idea is to relieve yourself of that, you pick up ASO. Once you put your employees in these pools, they're all buying insured products. So to subsidize your employees with enough money to make sure that's maintained, there's a cost to that. The other thing that happens, of course, is that the employer then loses coordination of the overall benefit. So you got a ton of employees that are going out there who may have made very few health care decisions in their lives trying to buy a policy, often those policies are bought today for ailments that aren't going to hit us for 5 to 10, 15 years. So trying to project out to the future of something somebody knows very little about isn't the easiest exercise in the world. When you look at private exchanges, it does offer the employer an opportunity to effectively outsource the benefit side of the program. So when they push those people into a private exchange, still, if I'm going to avoid the penalty, I have to provide the minimum coverage of 60% of the total cost. So when I do that, I've got to make sure that, in fact, those costs are making good enough money into the program so that they, in fact, aren't going to be -- aren't going to subject me to the penalties. The issue there then becomes today those -- the policies are being very well priced because people are trying to get market share. The question is as those costs increase, if the employer wants to continue to avoid the penalty, you're going to have to step up and continue to meet the 60% threshold in order to provide the coverage. So there's fairly a lot of uncertainty and certainly loss of control and a fair degree of risk. I can't tell you with any degree of certainty how all this is going to unfold over the next 2 to 5 years. But I will tell you today, most employees for their active workforces aren't -- at least what I'm hearing, aren't looking to drop their coverage today.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, I definitely appreciate all those comments. Maybe could you just follow up on the pricing methodology and profitability relative to your existing contracts?","George Paz","Yes, sure, exactly. I'll tell you what, if you don't mind, I'm going to turn that over to Tim. And Tim is with us today. As you know, he heads all of our sales and account management. I'll let him talk about our products' receptivity of the market and how we see it.","Timothy C. Wentworth","Sure, good morning, Glen, and thanks, George. If you take a look -- you asked about the private versus the public, obviously, in the public exchanges, we're playing through our health plan partners and in most cases, it's very early in the game still for a lot of them. But if you look at what they've built into their product suites and they put up in the market often across all the precious metals, it has been the kind of program that we have, for years, been successfully selling to carved out employers. Narrow networks, narrow formulary and a very high focus on home delivery. Given that, what that does is it takes the traditional health plan mix of business profitability and improves it quite dramatically if you compare it particularly to the employers that we're talking about who might move certain employee groups out into the exchanges, Glen. So while it's -- I can't give you a precise number, nor would I, what I can tell you is, directionally, it's attractive for us particularly when we factor in the fact over the long term, it adds additional lives to the business that we can actually take advantage of through our health plan partners. As it relates to the private exchanges, again, we play a number of -- there are several ways there and the dynamics are fairly similar. I think the difference is that there are some of those where, at least one particularly large one, where there is a carved-out PBM offering that looks remarkably similar to our profitability as we expected to see in any sort of medium to large employer. And so from our standpoint, again, we are -- I don't want to say we're indifferent to that, but from a financial standpoint, we largely are in an equivalent place as it relates to that. And in fact, I think over the long term, are advantaged because our consumer tools and our ability to work directly with those members who are now in plans that, if you will, are more up to them. Because if you talk to HR departments that have moved that direction, they're outsourcing essentially large pieces of what they were doing internally. And so from that standpoint, those employees and frankly, those employers who are in those exchanges look to us to help those employees make more rational choices and leverage their dollars.","Operator","Our next question will come from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I appreciate Dr. Miller's commentary on the formulary management changes, the changes to the national formulary. But I was hoping you could give us some perspective on the financial implications of this for Express. If I look back to your slides from last quarter, you highlighted that over $10 billion in client savings can drive $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion in EBITDA for Express. Is that the same type of relationship we should think about for the $700 million that you highlighted from these formulary changes?","George Paz","I'll take a crack at this, Steve, and if you want to chime in, please do. There's a couple of pieces here. There's a -- we have all different types of relationships with our clients. Some of them, they keep to the rebate; other ones, we get to keep them; and other ones, we share them. So it depends on how the plan designs work. Again, one size doesn't fit all. But let me also tell you, there's a lot of other impacts that occur throughout this process, which helps drive it to those levels that you're speaking off. So first of all, there is the sharing of the rebate, which is one piece. But the second piece, which is just as important, is the fact that now we have the opportunity to talk to that patient. And often, there's even a generic available in that class for the right indications. And so to the extent that we can push them down in the tiers, it helps improve our performance, helps improve client costs and helps patient costs come down, helps compliance, does a lot of great things for us and improves our shareholder profitability. And of course, when you have the opportunity to talk to a member, we can also talk about mail. So there's really not direct correlations between the formulary impact and the numbers you're referring to. But it all adds to that equation and this is one of the tools we will use to get to those levels of economics.","Steven Miller","Yes. George, the only thing I'll add is this actually furthers our model's alignment. We make money when we save our clients and patients money. And what we've done with the formulary is really a great thing for patients, payers and ourselves and our shareholders. And so we really are excited about what we are doing in this area.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","That makes sense. And if I could just maybe take a step back and ask you one on the outlook. I know, George, you're not giving guidance today. But this time last year, you called out the Street as being kind of overly aggressive on our outlook. I know 2014 guidance will get next quarter, but I was just wondering if you look out today, Street around the midpoint of your long-term EPS range, any initial comments you have around your comfort level with how the Street is thinking about the growth prospects for Express Scripts?","George Paz","Well, this, in all honesty, if I answer that question, I'm basically giving you guidance. And what I would have preferred to do is give you a detailed guidance with the -- and show you the components of it and show you how it's composed. I think Matt referenced our long-term vision on earnings, and we're not changing that. I believe that we are executing according to plan. I would also tell you that there's just a tremendous amount of uncertainty that exists in the market today. It's hard to say because if we talk about opportunities for us in the uninsured market, but at the end of the day, the exchanges aren't working all that well. And so it's hard to sit here today and project when that going to get -- what the impact of that is going to be and what's going to happen. And I'm incredibly bullish on our industry, in our company, in our people. But I just don't feel we're in a position today to give you that guidance, and I would really prefer to wait until the first quarter of next year and do this right with going deeper on all of our growth drivers, explaining how each of those work as Dr. Miller did today with formulary management, and take the numbers apart for you. I think that's a better solution.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","George, somebody commented in term of a slightly different way today. And this -- your comment around the selling season, innovation, upselling to your clients, can you maybe talk about what they are buying for 1\/1\/14 versus what we saw in '13? And where you see those opportunities, whether it's '14, '15? Maybe if you can just give us some kind of projection or thoughts going forward as to how much deeper you can get with your clients? What are the incremental opportunities?","George Paz","Lisa, that's a great question. And again, we'll unpack that a lot on our first quarter guidance call. But we also -- in order to try to answer that, I will tell you that CEOs today, probably more than ever, with the uncertainties around the economy, the situation occurring in D.C., on and on and on. Companies are looking for ways to reduce cost, stay profitable and maintain their competitive edge in the global economy. So things held off the table, 5, 6, 7 years ago because people were afraid of disruption. The HR departments and certainly companies have become much more open to taking on additional products. And as you can see in Steve's slide, when we're talking about affecting a very, very few of your employees to get massive amounts of savings, and by the way, you're doing nothing to hurt clinical values, in fact, because you're driving down costs, you're more likely improving health outcomes while you drive down those costs. It's a great combination for us, our clients and our patients. I'll let Tim go deeper into the -- what the actual product mix is and what's taking place.","Timothy C. Wentworth","Yes. Thanks, Lisa. What I would say -- actually, just to add a little color to what George said before I get more specific there. If you think about the pieces of our book, we've got -- you just heard us say a few minutes ago, our large and mid-sized employer book, by and large, are not going to exchanges. And that's what we see. So they're staying in the game, and that means they want to continue to aggressively manage and move to bronze as we called it. We got health plans that, more than ever, actually need help managing risk, because the businesses that are growing for them are businesses where, clearly, it's a trickier path and they need a strong partner. And then you got states and unions and some others that are not really in a position to drop. And so, again, they're in the game and being very aggressive as well. So you have, really, all of our components of our book of business. Actually, if you take the Department of Defense on top of that, they again are very focused on managing their money well. And so what you see is a very broad piece of the marketplace going to aggressively manage tools. And that's what we see that we're heavily installing again for January 1. So what does that mean? We see more employers putting in CDH plans. And I would actually point to CDH plans as an interesting dynamic when we think back to private exchanges. 10, 12 years ago, when the CDH plan started, the thought was in audit [ph] prices, PBMs may not play long term, but that may be all just simply carved in and you couldn't get systems to talk to each other and do real-time debiting. And I can tell you CDH plans now are a growth plan design dimension for us, which brings into, again, play. Us, helping those members move to home delivery, move to generics, move to tighter retail networks, but also we win new business now in the result of having strong CDH capabilities. So I look at sort of where it started, this is where it finished. And I see opportunities even in the private exchanges, as over time, they morph. But we aren't seeing a lot of that today in terms of private exchanges. We are, in terms of CDH. We are, in terms of specialty management. And that's across-the-board whether it's utilization management. Steve mentioned that a significant part of our new formulary is actually now moving into the specialty space, and we're taking advantage of multiple opportunities there to create competition and drive down costs and provide access and good care for patients. Our formulary, Steve talked about it, it's impossible to talk about how important and large that is to our employer book of business and then moving into the health plan book as they look at what's working in the commercial book of business. And so, as Steve said, our employees are our secret weapon there across-the-board to positioning us to an incredibly high adoption rate. We'll talk more about that at our Analyst Day, I believe. But the adoption rate and the satisfaction rate of our clients, with what we brought to them in terms of our formulary initiatives, it was nearly as big for our book of business as what we did Walgreens a couple of years ago. And probably every bit, if not more important, to helping our employers and their health plan stay in the game and rationally manage their costs. Our clinical solutions such as our productive modeling and our intervention RationalMed program, very strong uptick particularly now that that's on our destination platform. Fraud, waste and abuse, huge amount of interest in that program. And so, again, it's probably not a surprise to you that across the book, we're seeing significant continued opportunity for us to go deeper. I think last quarter, we showed you that there was a lot of room to run in terms of all of our key programs, home delivery, generics, specialty, formulary and retail networks. And we continue to see -- there's a lot of room to run, but we are definitely over the next year or 2, going to see significant uptick in a number of other areas there.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And so would you say that it's fair to say, George or Tim, that in the past, investors always looked at who was the customer and certain customers were more profitable than others. But in the future, what will determine who's more profitable is how highly managed the account is, where you can put your programs in place? Is that the right way to think about it?","Timothy C. Wentworth","I think it's exactly the right way to think about it. When we put those programs in place, we guarantee them, so we take incremental risk and we get paid for delivering on that risk. And the return to clients for us taking that risk is very, very high.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Okay. And let me just sneak one other one in. George, you've done a great job over the years from an acquisition standpoint, we consistently get that question of what's the next thing that Express Scripts would potentially do? Can you just give us any high-level thoughts as to how you're thinking about things?","George Paz","Well, I really like to finish this one first. We have a -- 1\/1\/14 is our -- it's an anticipated completion date of our member migration, which is huge. The cost of maintaining multiple platforms and having a common product offering is so important. Our clients meet regularly whether it's in our forums, as advisory groups or in other forums where they happen to get together, health conferences and what have you. And if you don't have a common offering, if you -- one client can get something and another client can't because your systems don't have the same offerings, that's a real problem for us or for anybody in the business world. So getting all that done is really important. That's stage 1 or step 1, is to get that done. Some of the back office stuff, which is what Matt was talking about, that's ancillary but it's an add-on, but it's important. Cleaning up the accounting components and some other retail stuff and some of the other pieces, those don't touch the members so much, but they're important to get those cleaned too. And we'll continue to fix -- finish all that up during the first half into the early second half of next year. So we'll get all that done and behind us. We constantly look, even after we closed the Medco deal, Lisa, we started looking at where else it makes sense. We are -- we believe we have unique capabilities, both in IT architecture, systems, product execution, skills, I can go on about our execution in our core competencies, but the issue is, as you know, many components of health care don't work very well. And the issue is what is it that is a bolt-on, an add-on, an adjacency that we can do to actually help our plans better manage their overall drug -- overall health care costs. And we're very open to looking at what those plans might be. We're very interested in doing some seed planting and trying to make sure that, in fact, we are looking at new product portfolios, new offerings, other ideas, to bring things in. And that will remain a focus of ours. So this is very much top of mind in our company.","Operator","And our next question will come from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Elizabeth Blake","This is Elizabeth in for Bob Willoughby. Just on share repurchases. Would you ever consider using a 10b5-1 program to purchase shares during a blackout period?","George Paz","We are always interested in managing our capital structure. We don't want to get into specifics of the different programs we use and the different ways we can execute, but we are -- we look at all the different options out there. We don't put anything as a no. We definitely looked at different components and then we deploy what we think is in our best interest and our shareholders' best interest to execute on a very managed capital structure.","Elizabeth Blake","Okay. And on that note, do you anticipate buying any stock during the first quarter? Or more kind of a back half of 2014 activity?","George Paz","Yes. Matt, referenced in his prepared comments that we would, in fact, continue to repurchase shares into the fourth quarter and in fact...","Elizabeth Blake","Sorry, I said the first quarter of 2014.","George Paz","The first quarter?","Elizabeth Blake","Yes.","George Paz","We'll provide that guidance. I'm sorry, I missed your question. Just to finish up, though, we will accelerate our purchases into the fourth quarter, so we'll stay on that path. As far as next quarter goes, we will do our Investor Day during -- right at -- some time around when the window is either opening or soon before so. We will disclose what we're going to do in the following year next year after we get all of our plans together. I don't think we're in a position today to discuss that.","Elizabeth Blake","Okay. And just a quick one, would your current tax rate for this quarter continue next year?","George Paz","I'll let Matt answer that, but let me just follow-up on one thing I did say. Matt did make a comment that we would deploy the majority of our free cash flow and try to, on a regular basis, return that to our shareholders. That stays one of the principles by which we will deliver our financial results. So we are committed to that and we'll just have to give you more guidance around that during our Investor Day. Matt, you want to talk about tax rate?","Matthew D. Harper","Sure, I'll comment on the tax rate. We're not prepared to really speak beyond 2013. We'll roll out our expectations for our tax rate for 2014 when we put together our 2014 guidance and talk about that first quarter of 2014. We're pleased that some of our tax planning strategies has come to fruition this year. But there's a lot of moving parts for next year and years beyond. We have additional strategies that we want to implement, but there's a lot of discussions at the state level around tax laws and the like. So we'll provide our direction and guidance on taxes in context of our total 2014 guidance in the first quarter.","George Paz","I will tell you, though, that taxes are very expensive component of our income statement, and so it is a focus of ours. And part of the negative of our buying Medco was some of their jurisdictions and their overall tax rate. So Matt and his team are -- and our controllership under Chris Knibb and his team, are very, very focused on driving down our overall tax rate. That goes straight to the bottom line, so that's important to us. And we don't want to get into specifics now, but just know that stays a focal point.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from Tom Gallucci with FBR.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I guess just first, on the quarter itself, it seemed like, at least versus what we are looking for, maybe the United Scripts rolled off a little bit more quickly. Can you help frame for people sort of the cost structure that's associated with that and your ability to tweak that down while the roll-off is happening versus what's sort of more fixed that you got to wait until it's over with?","George Paz","I'll take a stab at that. Matt, if you want to add anything, feel free. There's 2 pieces to it. As the actual claims roll off, you relieve yourself of the DPC cost, so to the extent a mail order script goes away, you carry less inventory, you carry less -- you don't process it. So you can take people down in staff functions as you reduce cost. The bigger question is when it's completely gone, which occurs at the end of this year. Then our plans are to look at our footprint and figure out what fixed cost can be removed. And we'll include that in our guidance for next year, we're going to give it. Because we can take a lot of variable costs, which you see in our financials, we could pay up some fixed costs as the business declines, but this is a very big client with a lot of scripts. And so we've got to -- we have reevaluated our footprint effort is gone and then make our decision around fixed costs platforms. Matt?","Matthew D. Harper","My only addition to that is, in 2013, we're focused on 2 key items or -- one is the client migrations on to the destination platform, but it's also managing our cost structure as this united businesses is rolling off. And as George alluded to, some of that is near-term cost savings that we can manage in conjunction if the claims are rolling off, and some of it is going to be more long term once the business is totally gone and that would be considered in the context of our 2014 guidance as well.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. I think -- the other day on its call, WellPoint seemed to imply some escalators maybe in the contract that you all have, and I thought what was also interesting about it was they were talking about maybe some ways to reduce their costs. I think they pointed to maybe custom pharmacy networks, local areas and whatnot, Can you offer any color on either of those 2 topics and then what you're seeing there?","George Paz","WellPoint is a very great partner for us, and they -- we work very closely with them. And all the stuff Tim had talked to about earlier on is WellPoint is a very sophisticated client, they understand that their ability to be competitive in the marketplace is hugely important. And so utilizing the tools that we have to offer allows that to occur. So I don't want to get into specifics here, but they'd certainly understand the tools and are deploying tools to make sure they're on a competitive footing. I don't know, Tim, if you have anything you want to add or not?","Timothy C. Wentworth","No, nothing to add. I mean, it's a great partnership and we are engaged across their lines of business, because they've got geography and they got business lines. And we are neck-deep in opportunities to help them across all of those areas.","Thomas Gallucci - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. Last one, George. Just wondering if you had any update on your thoughts regarding the CFO slot?","George Paz","Sure. We did have a search going on as we speak. And so we will evaluate some candidates. I think it's interesting. When you talk about senior management, it's really about -- there's a lot of great players out there. The real issue is one that fits with the culture, the drive, the passion. And you want somebody that really understands finance, but it's just as important to me that they understand patient caring and empathy towards our clients and our patients. And so it's a very key role and we're not going to move fast on this, we're going to make a good, sound decision. And unfortunately, that takes a little while.","Operator","And our next question is going to come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","George, you said on your prepared comment that the selling season is substantially in line with where you were in the second quarter. I think last quarter, retention rates were 95%, taking into account client consolidation. Is this still the number that we should be thinking of? And also can you give us some context as to the net number including the wins?","George Paz","I don't want to get into specifics there because, again, what we're then taking apart is next year's guidance. What I prefer to say is that we are in line with the numbers we gave during the second quarter, and we'll update those when we get into next year. So we'll give you a breakdown on the selling season, on our retention rates, on clinical upsells, our programs we're putting in place, the moves we're making, our SG&A forecasting and our long term -- our current year earnings targets. So I prefer to wait on that till next quarter.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then the job distributors have been talking a lot about generic inflation as a tailwind to their results. And we've been getting questions on what generic price increases mean to the PBM. So can you help us just then understand what's the impact, if there is one? And also, in line with kind of like the generic thinking, what you're seeing kind of like more move towards consolidation of the supply chain and convergence? Is there some sort of disadvantage for you if you don't participate in that sort of a joint venturer partnership?","George Paz","I think we're incredibly well positioned. When you think about it, we're spending $100 billion a year. And so I think we're a client that -- not only do we spend a lot, but in our situation, our purchases are very, very manageable and measured, they can be scheduled. So if you're a manufacturer and you're trying to fill your production cycles, you know exactly where we fit into those and how much quantity we're trying to -- we need. And I think it really fits well for them. So yes, we go out in advance and we secure pricing. I think generics remain a very important component of our ability to drive down costs. And it's a key driver in our profitability. We're not seeing -- there's always ups and downs. There's always product shortages. There's hard-to-get products and other things. But, overall, we're not seeing anything that's causing us any concern.","Operator","And the next question will come from John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Tim, a quick follow-up for you. When you survey your employer clients about this exchange issue, on a longer-term basis, do you get a sense about what percentage might consider an exchange if they work effectively?","Timothy C. Wentworth","Most of them will tell you they don't even know. But what I would say, generally, is the things that are causing them to wait and see are depending as much on external variables. So for example, when employers look at the idea of dropping lives and there are some that would say the private exchanges are a gateway drug to the public exchanges for certain populations as a way of kind of moving those out, the question then becomes, do you really believe that the $2,000 penalty stays $2,000? And as you do the math what you see is, for a great number of the employers, any long-term set of reasonable assumptions causes them to not only stay in short term, but longer term. And so what I'd say is it's very uncertain. I'm not going to sit here and tell you they're absolutely staying through '18 or whatever year you want to pick. But what I would say is, I don't see folks standing on the edge of the pool ready to jump quickly or even in the medium term, by and large.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And a follow-up, can you remind us what percent of your book on a volume basis are represented by employers at this point?","Timothy C. Wentworth","So I think, generally, if you look across, broadly defined, it's approximately 30% of our book.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. And then maybe a quick follow-up, Dr. Miller, if you're still there. The formulary changes that you've made sounds like they've been a very effective mechanism. Are you finding that to be effective in specialty as well, given it seems like that's where the highest rates of inflation and utilization are?","Steven Miller","So one of really exciting points to this formulary change, as you know, is we actually exclude drugs in 5 specialty categories. This is really unprecedented in the industry and its providing our clients a lot of predictability for their specialty spend going forward. And so the enthusiasm the clients have had for the changes we made in specialty are really unprecedented.","Operator","And our next question will come from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe a question for Tim here. You talked about a lot of the tools that you have in the exchanges for consumers, particularly, as they're going to have to start shopping for their own health care. Can you talk about how your advertising -- how can you advertise that to consumers or employees as they go into these exchanges, whether public or private? So to know about that, particularly, whether you're carved out or you're carved in, how do you get your message out there?","Timothy C. Wentworth","So when it's carved in, which is where the predominant sort of volume is -- that we're talking about, we have the great fortune of having clients with great brands. And if you look at the Blues, for example, they're in tremendous position, as you know, as well as the number of our other regional health plans. So it's important we help or we're able to basically leverage their brand and their access to these patients. We embed ourselves in their websites, for example. We've worked with Blues to be part of their apps to the extent that their numbers use those sorts of tools, as well as having our member service advocates directly involved, or in some cases, having their membership as advocates using our tools to service their members. So it really varies depending on the individual Blue plan where it's carved in -- or a regional health plan where it's carved in, how we help them through them get to the member or directly get to the member based on our relationship with them. We're -- it's actually a carved out situation, then it's fairly straightforward for us. We employ all the usual tools that we wield, in terms of communicating with these folks, through all the channels using our consumerology to heighten engagement rates and outcomes and so forth. Again, our Web, which is just on redesign and about to be relaunched, is a tremendous tool for us and for our members to, not only transact, but to find the lowest cost alternatives. We push those messages out to them and so forth. Now that's a place where we've made significant investments and those investments really pay off for those consumers, again, whether it's a direct relationship or through our health plans.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","So if I can just follow-up, a quick question on to -- about formularies again here. You talked about 1% of drugs excluded, you talked of 48 drugs in particular, what percentage of drugs on the national formulary are suitable for exclusion as well? And if we were to look at the reasons for exclusion, I mean is it as simple as something that is worth of twice daily to once daily? Going to once daily is not really enough to be included on the formulary anymore?","Steven Miller","As you know, there is more and more competition across the drug classes. This represents a great opportunity for us. And as you know, a lot of the products that are coming to the market are me-too product. And so we always put clinical first. The care of the patient has to be the #1 consideration. But when there are alternatives, they provide equally good, if not better clinical outcomes, it is our obligation to actually leave market share towards those products, give those manufacturers more market share and give bigger discounts to our patients and their payers. And so we look at the future as actually having additional opportunities. So while we've taken on these 5 classes today, we're already looking at other opportunities. And to be very frank, the pharmaceutical manufacturers have taken great notice of this. They are reaching out to our pharma services team. And already, are talking about what the future looks like. And so we think there's more to come, and we think it's going to lead to, not only lower cost but actually in the end, better access and better health outcomes.","Operator","And our next question will come from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","George, just a big picture question on PBM health plan partnerships which, obviously, seems more important than ever with the evolution of exchanges. We've all, obviously, seen the WellPoint, Cigna, Aetna, UNH strategies unfold over the past couple of years. When you think about the remaining landscape, which is still pretty large once you get beyond those 4, I guess the 2 questions I have kind of interrelated is, first, what's the current temperature for other health plans to still see potential PBM partnerships? And then maybe more importantly, is there any possibility we could see new PBM health plan partnerships just for exchange business, whether it's public or private? And to me that would see logical just in the evolving marketing efforts around the exchanges, but I'm just curious to get your thoughts on that.","George Paz","There's still a couple of health plans that offer their own PBM. There's not a lot anymore and there's also several that in source different components of it for a variety of reasons. So -- but I would say the majority of health plans, except the big ones, except for maybe United and Humana, have actually outsourced their PBM. And the question is always -- this is 90% of the transactions and 15%, 18% of the cost, and so from a health plan perspective, if you're looking at scale, size, all those pieces, at least in my mind, and I guess I'm a little biased here, but I think it makes a tremendous amount of sense for them to outsource. We outsource a lot of our back office things that don't add value to our clients. Here, we can actually add value to their clients by bringing a lot of scale and size and quality together for a very small health plan to get the ability to have the adjudication platform, the clinical tools, the expertise that goes into this. I think that would be tough to do. So I do think this is -- that we are very relevant today, becoming more relevant every day. So I like where we sit as far as the exchanges go. That's -- as Tim mentioned earlier, part -- as you know, one of our big attention items is to actually helping an individual manage. Although our client is the health plan sponsor, we put a tremendous amount of effort looking at every patient who uses Express Scripts services and try to optimize their spend and optimize their health outcome. And that's been our specialty. And I think that's somewhere we will continue to focus. So when you think about private and public exchanges effectively, these are becoming the individual as the consumer, and what's right for them. And as Tim mentioned earlier, I think this is an area where we have a one up expertise that nobody else in the industry has and I'm very happy with our positioning.","Timothy C. Wentworth","Being on a single platform, having to be industrial strength the way that we are, I think is going to create a tremendous amount of opportunity for us in the future to service either some populations or even have plans that are using other PBMs today. Take a good hard look at what we're doing because it is increasingly difficult to stay in that business and stay in a way that makes your plans feel that they're with the right player. And we are in a very, very good position as we look at our sales pipeline and the opportunities over the next 3 years that we think are coming our way. Being really sound where the growth is coming, which is this regulated section of the marketplace is going to serve us very well.","George Paz","Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We really appreciate your questions. We look forward to getting with you in the first quarter of next year for our Investor Day. And if you have any follow-up questions or comments, please feel free to reach out to David Myers. He's available to answer any other questions you might have. So thank you all very much. And make sure tomorrow night at 7:00 Central Time, you watch the Cardinals beat the Red Sox for the second game, second win for us. So thank you very much and have a great weekend.","Operator","And that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&T Executive Teleconference service.

If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ben Bier, Vice President of Investor Relations.

With me today are Tim Wentworth, CEO and President, and Eric Slusser, Executive Vice President and CFO.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement: Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations, or intentions.

The press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.express-scripts.com.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Eric.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will cover our financial performance for 2016 and provide an update on our 2017 guidance. Then I'll turn it over to Tim to discuss why we are a unique market force that improves healthcare.","In 2016, we demonstrated to our clients, our members and to our shareholders, the ability of Express Scripts to improve healthcare.","First, we delivered for our patients. Express Scripts' members had their share of total cost decrease for the second year in a row. We excluded fewer drugs from our National Preferred Formulary and still drove greater savings, while maintaining broad access.","Second, we delivered for payers. Our Drug Trend Report showed that we held the line for payers, keeping the increase in drug trend to just 3.8%, a 27% decrease from last year. Nearly a third of our clients worked with us to aggressively manage the benefit and, as a result, they had a negative trend. And in a year where brand name drug inflation was 11%, we helped protect client unit costs holding the increase to just 2.5%.","These data-points and many others can be found in our Drug Trend Report and I hope that you will read through it. We base our research on real data generated by real solutions. While some challenge our industry and the value it brings with erroneous observations and flawed analysis, the facts speak for themselves and our data speaks strongly for the important work we do.","And finally, we delivered double-digit earnings growth and returned cash to our shareholders. We deployed $4.7 billion of cash during 2016 through stock repurchases. We grew GAAP EPS by 51% to $5.39, and adjusted EPS by 16% to $6.39.","Now let's get into the results for the quarter. We reported adjusted earnings per diluted share of $1.88 for our fourth quarter results, which represents growth of 21% over the fourth quarter of last year.","During the fourth quarter, our GAAP earnings per diluted share grew 107%, largely due to the strong performance of our core PBM business and the Liberty tax benefit of $511 million, of which $41 million was used as a special one-time payment to reward our employees for reaching a favorable outcome in their multi-year effort to attain the refund.","We adjudicated 354.9 million adjusted claims generating adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion, up 6%, which results in adjusted EBITDA for adjusted claim of $5.79, or growth of 14% year-over-year despite the continued roll off of Coventry and Catamaran from our books.","Adjusted SG&A ramped down in the fourth quarter and decreased by 23% versus the fourth quarter of 2015. This was a result of reduced annual incentive compensation in both the third and fourth quarters due to the reduction in our 2016 EBITDA guidance in the third quarter.","During 2016, we also hired a new Chief Information Officer who is tasked with building a multiyear IT roadmap for the company. As that IT roadmap was in development, many projects were delayed or deferred in the fourth quarter, which resulted in lower project spending that impacted SG&A and capital expenditures. From a cash flow perspective, our strong quarter generated $2.2 billion of net cash flow from operations.","Finally, I want to comment on one other item in the quarter. As part of our enterprise-wide revenue recognition assessment in preparation for our adoption of a new accounting standard, we identified some previously recognized contract revenue within our Other Business Operations segment that was ultimately not billable. This resulted in an immaterial out of period revenue adjustment of approximately $86 million. We recognized the cumulative effect of this adjustment within our consolidated results in the fourth quarter of 2016.","For our full year 2016 results, we generated $6.39 of adjusted earnings per diluted share, which represents another year of double-digit growth at 16%. Our adjusted claims for the year were 1.4 billion, down 2% over the prior year. Excluding the impact of Coventry rolling off our books, our volume growth was up 2.8% for the year.","As mentioned, adjusted SG&A came in lower than we had originally forecasted for the year, driven largely by reductions in incentive compensation and project spending.","Depreciation was also lower in the second half of 2016 relative to the second half of 2015 as a result of assets being taken out of service in 2015 during the final stages of our integration.","We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $7.3 billion and adjudicated over 1.4 billion total adjusted claims, resulting in an adjusted EBITDA for adjusted claim of $5.16, or a growth of 6.0%.","Full year net cash flow from operations was $4.9 billion. We deployed $10.6 billion of cash during 2016, $4.7 billion to repurchase common stock via an accelerated share repurchase agreement and open market purchases, and $5.9 billion to retire debt.","Now let's turn to 2017. Our 2017 annual guidance remains unchanged from what we provided in December 2016. Currently, we are forecasting adjusted SG&A for 2017 to be approximately $1.9 billion as several items that were favorable in 2016 will likely not repeat in 2017, namely, the lower incentive compensation, lower project spending and depreciation. We expect depreciation to trend up year-over-year as new assets are put into service in 2017.","For the first quarter 2017, we are forecasting adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.30 to $1.34 per share. The quarterly trend for our adjusted earnings per diluted share is expected to be similar to what we experienced in 2016.","As in previous years, we're expecting a higher earnings ramp in the back half of 2017, as we realize higher utilization of our SafeGuardRx programs throughout the year and increased penetration of generics in our book of business, as well as, the timing of supply chain initiatives and higher Medicare Part D revenue driven by the benefit design and reinsurance payments from the government.","That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, Eric and good morning. Today, I want to spend a few minutes addressing a number of issues investors and others have been asking about. Let me first say that in my nearly 20 years in the PBM business, I have never been prouder of the results we create, but I've never seen more misinformation and absence of facts in the dialog about our role.","So let me start with the facts. Drug companies set drug prices and over the last eight years those list prices have increased by more than 200%. If not for us, our clients and patients would be left to pay those costs.","Drug makers set prices and we exist to bring those prices down to ensure patients can access the drugs they need and the payers can afford them. We use every tool in our arsenal to do it and are constantly innovating new ways to bring costs in line and create greater patient access. We did that with hepatitis C and we are doing the same with diabetes, inflammatory conditions and other key therapeutic areas. And last year we limited our clients' total impact to a 2.5% increase in unit cost in a year where brand inflation was 11%.","To achieve affordability in the face of increasing brand drug prices, we prioritize generic drug use, formulary management, step therapy, tight management of retail networks and in the case of Turing's Daraprim, we even found a way to offer a competing pill for about $1.","26,000 of us wake up every day, thinking about how to save our patients' money and lower drug prices. One key element of driving down drug cost to payers is rebates. Drug makers began using rebates years ago, offering them in exchange for access to patients and the resulting market share.","They offer rebates to incentivize payers to prefer their products over the competitor's therapeutically equivalent products. Pharma will pay higher rebates to payers who are able to shift market share to them and away from competing manufacturers.","The PBM industry by aggregating buying power and creating a competitive market allows smaller payers to enjoy the same access to rebates as larger payers. They all benefit. This would not happen without us and without our industry. It is important to note manufacturers set prices and choose whether to use rebates to encourage preference for their products. 100% of the time our clients determine how to share rebates.","In 2016, our clients directly received 89% of the rebate dollars paid to us. The rest was retained by us in a fully transparent manner as payment for doing our job to bring down costs. We work with each client to align their overall pricing with the way they want to pay us.","Some clients prefer to keep 100% of the rebates and pay us administrative fees and program fees and the like. Other clients prefer we share in a predetermined portion of the rebates in lieu of writing us a check for administrative fees and other things that we do. This model aligns us with our clients, we benefit when we lower their prices.","In addition, we've had a few clients who have us keep all the rebates and use them to subsidize other price points and discounts in their pricing. The point is, in every case, we work with our clients and the consultants to determine how rebates are used and to maximize their positive impact on plan costs.","In the end, the growth in rebates is proof that we are doing our job. To suggest that our creating competition and the resulting rebates is why prices go up is uninformed and simply wrong. For example, as I said before, when we finally got a competitor in hepatitis C, net cost dropped by half, in part because of rebates. Alternatively in oral oncology, for example, rebates are practically nonexistent, only two out of 88 products pay rebates, yet prices have gone up 100% over five years. You can't blame rebates for that.","Another area of recent interest is direct and indirect remuneration fees or DIR fees as they're called. The specific DIR fees which have come into question are those which are agreed to in our contracts with retail pharmacies and help drive down the costs providing coverage to Medicare Part D recipients. Simply put, DIR fees we received are passed back directly to plan sponsors, reported to CMS, and lower the cost of providing coverage. If they were to go away, it would negatively impact plan sponsors and the government across the board, but it would have no financial impact on us.","Finally, let me for a moment discuss the regulatory and legislative environment. With all of the discussion about the ACA, the constant is that our deep expertise in Medicare, Medicaid and the exchanges will help our clients navigate a complex and changing landscape. This is what we did when Medicare Part D was approved. This is what we did when the ACA was approved. It is what we do as states evolve their Medicaid rules, and it is why clients hire us.","In addition to being ready and able to help our clients adapt, we are also advocating for key policy changes at the state and federal level, including accelerating the introduction of biosimilars, allowing the FDA to prioritize applications based on market need, prohibiting pay for delay, prohibiting coupons from drug manufacturers and eliminating the tax deduction for DTC advertising among others.","Also earlier this month law makers introduced the Lower Drug Costs through Competition Act. I love the name of that, which will encourage drug makers to bring competitors to single-source products to market faster. We are working to help see this program become law.","In addition to advocating these positions, we are investing in new digital tools to help patients find the lowest cost pharmacy, identify lower cost alternatives for the drug they are taking, to see their HSA information across medical and pharmacy and many other things.","These tools provide information to patients in real-time and are continuing to evolve to help them navigate a complex myriad of benefit designs and empowering them to make better decisions.","We are focused on driving a true sea change in affordability and access and we are fully engaged at the state and federal level with law makers who consistently cite our solutions and actions as examples of what can be done to transform pharmacy care and generate value for patients and payers.","Our ability to achieve meaningful results for payers and patients, and growth in our business is a direct result of our having a terrific collection of assets, including, by the way, our 26,000 people. These assets are particularly important in the context of longer term dynamics in the pharmaceutical market and healthcare more broadly.","In addition, the needs of employers to provide strong value benefits to employees in a more competitive job market as well as the needs of health plans to flexibly adapt to changing market conditions while maintaining affordable premiums and superior health outcomes all point to the long-term opportunities our focused independent model creates.","Being independent we can plug into any health plan to make their medical management program smarter. We can work with any retailer to pull together the best network for a particular client given their goals. We are positioned to create clinically based competition among pharma manufacturers and drive the evolution of value-based contracting.","We have the flexibility, creativity and focus to nimbly respond to market events which threaten our clients or create opportunities that we can aggressively capture. Our independent model uniquely allows us the flexibility to leverage our assets while serving our clients and patients.","It also fuels our focus on continually innovating to achieve one purpose, to make pharmacy safer and more affordable, bringing value-based care to life. Express Scripts delivers care, creates access and helps payers stay in the game.","We've demonstrated that in a complex and dynamic environment we can change, adapt and create value for shareholders just as we do patients. And in a world where value-based care is being debated in terms of what form it takes or how it gets delivered, we are showing how to do it today.","I look forward to talking to you more in the Q-and-A session. Thank you. Operator, you can open up the lines.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our first question comes from Lisa Gill. Ma'am, you may begin.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","What do you think it takes to change the dialog, though? I appreciate that you told us the amount of rebates that you've retained and it sounds like a fair number. But, do you still think that there needs to be one more transparency in the marketplace?","And two, if we were to move to gross where you're getting rebates and we move more to net pricing, what does that do to the PBM business model?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So I think that, first of all, the way that we continue to evolve the conversation is to be engaged, as I said, that we've been in. It's also to \u2013 try to not appear to be finger pointing, but rather to defining solutions which is why we are working in concert with legislators but also to, again, try to work with manufacturers to go beyond just rebates to value-based care as I've said, Lisa. But getting to unit price matters and right now, at least, it's legislative rebates, you look obviously in the government programs. So the amount of change that would be required for a wholesale change would be fairly significant.","And quite frankly, when you really look at it, our clients get how the rebates work. They are not unhappy with the fact that their gross to net costs are in a manageable level. They think it should still be lower. They are not happy with drug companies raising their prices as they are. But again, we've been able to largely insulate them from that.","The issue and I think the reason it becomes a political issue is, there are two things that have happened over the last several years. One is that drug prices have escalated fairly dramatically and without really any natural rationale, again that's gross drug prices. And then there is something that hasn't been discussed a lot which was an unintended consequence of the ACA and that was that in 2015 for a great number of patients, out of pocket maximums were integrated between pharmacy and medical creating one single large out of pocket max.","And for patients, as you can imagine, high deductible plans have been in existence for quite some time, back in the early 2000s. The big change was they typically had out of pocket maxes for pharmacy or other things that didn't cause pharmacy patients who were not using the medical benefit extensively to have to encounter thousands of dollars of out of pocket maximums. But by integrating these things, we've seen more patients and we are beginning to study this and help our plans look at ways to put some guardrails for those patients on those unintended consequences. But those patients become the story of the night on a news program, because, quite frankly, they are in a very difficult position.","And then you take the fact that pharmacy is usually the first used benefit of the year. It's the only part of medicine really where you have to pay upfront if you're going to get the service. Your doctor's office bills you later, you go in to an emergency room, you get treatment, and so these patients suddenly find themselves in a difficult spot and, again, our job is to help them through that and help folks understand as we have a (23:00) policy positions that there are things that we can work with our clients to do to put those guardrails in place.","But back to the other question, and I'm sorry for the long winded answer. To the extent that over time manufacturers evolve to more of a net cost or a discounted model, which again I think in my prepared remarks I tried to explain a little bit why that may be more difficult, because they don't want to give everybody the same low price. If somebody has more bargaining power than somebody else, they're not going to want to have that be the price that everybody than pays. But assuming that they do begin to move that direction, from our standpoint that's the model that we use in generics today. We would welcome that, quite frankly.","Again, for me, I'm not interested in more rebates, for example in Enbrel and Humira, I'm interested in the biosimilar, which the acquisition cost will cause the products in that class to all have to lower their price. That's the way our model works best.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Tim, I know right now it seems that people don't really care all that much about fundamentals. But, if we \u2013 when we come back to that in the market, can we maybe just spend just one minute talking about the 2017 selling season? How do you think about that? How do you think about the opportunities in the marketplace? How Express Scripts is positioned and then lastly just what you have up for renewal as we think about going into the selling season?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I'll start with the end. Our renewals is extraordinarily sort of normal this year. We did not have a large or an incrementally larger block than we have over the last few years at all. And I would say we are off to a very strong start there, which again to the extent that my prepared remarks speak about clients getting it, these clients have choices. They don't have to use us or any PBM. The fact of the matter is, our 90 \u2013 almost 98% retention rate last year what we are seeing in the market again in terms of a couple of early sales wins as well as the conversations we're having, are all about our solutions and our SafeGuard programs for example, what are the things that highly managed clients do and can we put those things in place in ways that help them achieve better results for themselves than they're achieving with their current provider. Those are the conversations that we're currently having in the marketplace.","And actually, Dave Queller who is \u2013 he is in the room here with me, who heads up sales and account management for us, literally, just had his whole field force outside. Dave, I don't know if there is any incremental color you want to give Lisa as it relates to the selling season in the marketplace?","David A. Queller - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Tim, I would add that, and thanks for the question Lisa, we are having great conversations with our \u2013 obviously our in force customers as we speak right now. We're in our planning sessions and then also with our new clients. We are having a number of conversations around 90-day retail programs, and putting those in place. Our SafeGuard programs are creating a lot of energy and conversation in the marketplace, specifically around inflammatory, diabetes and obviously the oncology program. And I would say last but not least, Lisa, the conversation now around narrowing the networks and seeing opportunities do that. That's probably not as prevalent as the other programs, but we are seeing the conversation around narrowing of the networks and seeing where the value can be driven there where it makes sense. So overall...","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And then the last thing. How about on specialty though Dave. I mean is that still the biggest driver as people are thinking about the upcoming 2017 selling season for 2018?","David A. Queller - Express Scripts Holding Co.","We are spending a lot of time on specialty in conversations. We've actually had some very good wins at the beginning of this year with some health plan clients taking over their specialty business.","On the commercial side, we are very well penetrated with our clients and doing all the right things to help support them. As I discussed, Lisa, the inflammatory program is one good example of that, and then the health plans as well are very engaged.","I would say that we are not seeing the trend numbers that we've seen in the past few years, but there is still going to be trend coming in that vein. And as Tim mentioned, our goal is the biosimilars to help drive down the overall costs.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you both. I appreciate your comments.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby from Credit Suisse. Sir, your line is now open.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you. Tim or Eric, can you give us just a quick sound bite maybe on each of the Care Value Programs that did start up this year? What happened with enrollment? How was the reception there? And anecdotally what it could mean to profitability for you? And then just for Eric, capital deployment in the past years has been a little bit clearer with some ASRs here. Can you give us a sense absent an ASR? How should we think about the cadence of share repurchases maybe over the course of this year?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. So I will start, Bob, and thanks for the question. As you may recall, the Diabetes Care Value Program is actually going live in just a couple of weeks. We have strong enrollment in that, over 6 million lives, I believe, and continuing to grow. As you may recall, that one requires a bit of a plan design change. So that one is going to have a ramp-up over the course of a year because there will be some clients that want to put it in place, but can't put it in until January of 2018 because of narrowing the retail choices down to a Retail 90 narrow network that's providing incremental clinical benefits as well as cost benefits there.","So that's very, very strong though. And if you think about, again, a mid-year sort of implementation and the clients have received that very well. Diabetes has been a big pain point as you know and being able to cap their trends at approximately half of what they otherwise would be and guarantee that is meaningful.","The Inflammatory Conditions Program, we've seen very wide acceptance of that. And I would say that's been easier because it doesn't require a plan design change. Health plans have been very attracted to that as well, because again, they don't have to go out and do anything as it relates to up-selling their clients. It's simply a better clinical model in terms of acknowledging that many of these new patients that start out on these products flip off of them onto another product in the first 60 to 90 days and getting a good portion of that money back is just -- it's like finding dollar bills on the ground for our clients and they love the fact that we're finding them and going out and creating them for them. So strong up sell of both of those. Obviously the core programs continue to \u2013 they've had very strong continued enrollment. And so we view that as, again, a long-term chassis to build in a number of other things over the next several years as we look across other therapies.","For example, we know PCSK9s are about to come out with potentially some data from Amgen that could enlarge that patient population. And so we are actively re-looking at our Cardiovascular Care Value Program to put out 2.0 as it relates to those products. And in all these cases, the way that it benefits us is, first of all, lowering our client trends is how we get to 98% retention rates and it's how we win new business. But also to the extent that these clients use our channels whether that's our Retail 90 channels, our mail channel, our Accredo specialty to underpin those guarantees, then we are benefited by serving those patients directly.","In terms of the second part of your question, I'll turn that over to Eric to answer.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah, Bob. So on capital deployment, as we talked about on the December call when we gave guidance, our plan assumes for the most part ratable purchases throughout the year. And as we've always indicated, it will be based on cash flow excluding any capital expenditures and hopefully anything that might be used on M&A. Other than that, the plan would be to deploy it all for share repurchases. At this point, our plan is to be back in the market when the blackout period clears at the end of this month. At this point, the plan is to do both the open market purchases similar to what we did in the fourth quarter, and also most likely use a Form 10b5-1 plan that will allow us to continue to purchase during the blackout periods. We haven't ruled out ASR later in the year, but at this point we're going to stick to the open market and 10b5-1 approach and we believe we can achieve our expected results through those means.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Percher from Barclays. Sir, your line is now open.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. I'll continue on the financial questions. So the guidance for next year on SG&A, $1.9 billion, you're stepping off the base of $1.859 billion for this year. It looks like quite a bit of the decline we saw over the last 12 months was D&A based and I know you spoke to that. As we try to balance what was lower incentive comp and the project spend, that depreciation amount, I think we have an offset in incentives for SafeGuards that you talked about in the first half of the year. Could you give us a little bit of guidance in terms of seasonality and maybe as you look at $1.9 billion for next year, how does that look to you relative to what you think the normalized growth rate out of this quarter is?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah. Let me \u2013 Eric, thanks for the question. Let me kind of bridge. So, if you think about the adjusted rate, and you gave it, of $1.859 billion and I talked about the incentives and the project spend that's lowered, that's somewhere between probably $60 million to $65 million of impact that we'll return. So if you add that back, you get to that $1.920 billion, $1.925 billion. The depreciation impact that's going to go up just because of in-servicing that I talked about is probably around $25 million.","So if you take all that and kind of get to a pro forma for 2016, we're going to be flat to slightly down even off of that rate. And the other thing I'll remind you is, each year in SG&A we start out with about a 6.0% to 7.0% increase driven by wages, lease increases, contract increases, consultant increases and just things in there that are impacted by business growth.","So, that $1.9 billion number not only comes off of the 2016 trend, but also mitigates all of that otherwise increase that we face every year. So we're very pleased with the $1.9 billion, but as you know, we are always SG&A focused. We'll continue to be throughout the year. As far as the quarters, most of the downward trend was late third quarter and fourth quarter as we talked about. I would expect trends to be similar quarter-to-quarter as you saw in previous years, even though we're not going to guide to quarterly SG&A.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And maybe relative to the on-boarding season that unique expense that you carried in the first half of last year, is there a similar expense for getting programs like the diabetes program up and running or was that unique last year?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, some of the incentive we had was unique to last year that won't repeat. But we do have higher cost earlier in the year as we on-board for all of the 1\/1 activities and everything else. So, you'd expect to see higher levels in the first half versus the second half.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian from Citi Research. Ma'am, your line is now open.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tim and Eric. I appreciate the color on the percentage of rebates retained, Tim. So just to follow up on those. Given how this term has been misused in let's say the past year or two, how has your view evolved in terms of where you'd like the optimal mix to be, the pass-through versus portion you keep to effectively align the company with your clients?","And I guess related to that, you mentioned some of \u2013 the different options that clients have, but how have their views changed in terms of constructing contracts with 100% pass-through versus focusing on other aspects of pricing.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","It's a good question and thanks for it. I mean, first of all, listen, at the end of the day, I don't have a target, right. So it's not a question of we'd like it to be 15% or we'd like it to be 20% or 0%. My goal is to keep clients and aligned to make money when we save them money and rebates are a piece of that. But again, I'd frankly rather be paid to dispense generics or to not dispense PCSK9s to patients that shouldn't receive them rather than anything else. And so from that standpoint, from a standpoint of where we're at, I like being aligned with clients on rebates because they are an important component. I don't like sharing too much because then they'll come back to us halfway through.","So this business has always been a business where you don't want to over-earn and we never have. We make sure that we get paid for the work that we do. And I love the study that came out that showed every dollar that a client pays us directly or indirectly is worth about $6 to them. Rebates are a piece of that. And if you go back in history, back when there was another PBM that existed, that doesn't exist now that used to report rebates, you'd notice that it's actually a fairly similar percentage. So I think the market sort of just naturally gravitates this way.","Now, I can also tell you it does change over time. We have three large health plans where we just began doing rebates for them where they were doing it themselves. So they wanted to leverage our scale and our insights, okay. And in all cases they wanted to share in the upside with us. And again, I prefer that because I think our model works best when we align with clients.","As to how the contracts have changed, from my standpoint they haven't changed a lot. What you've seen is an increasing level of precision, because what happens is clients who have experience in the marketplace more broadly and their consultants will sometimes get very, very focused on making sure that we have all rebates sort of swept into this. And so we've been very, very precise with our clients and I think evolved very, very well to defining rebates in a way that are auditable, that the clients can count on and so forth.","I think the last piece is probably what clients would tell you if you talk to them is they've pushed us hard to guarantee the rebates so that we are on the hook to go out and lower their costs. And we've been willing to take that challenge.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. It's funny, you mentioned the other PBM. We have plotted the rebates retained. And I was just trying to envision if we started to plot Express Scripts metric starting from this point forward, sort of what it would look like from a couple years from now, but it sounds like...","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I'll make a prediction, actually. Because I'll tell you, if you look \u2013 we looked backwards as we were sort of looking at this number. We want to be really thoughtful about putting a number out there. It's been quite stable and I would anticipate that it will continue to be quite stable.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then maybe a follow-up in the spirit of the transparency conversation. This metric gets us partly to what the other firms in the past had shared with us. So is there any consideration still being thought through in terms of breaking out specialty or also some high level but still quantifiable sales metrics that we used to sort of receive? Are those things still on the table that you guys are, in the near future, going to report out on?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","What I would tell you, again, obviously today's a fourth quarter last year look back so we didn't, and it's early in the selling season, so if we were to move forward with some sort of an incremental sales metric, you wouldn't have heard it now anyway.","And the short answer is, we are absolutely challenging ourselves. I would tell you that breaking out specialty is probably less likely. Although, giving you more visibility to may be specialty metrics that we haven't figured out is something that we are talking through as well. But specialty is so integrated to our overall business that in the old days where I used to work, obviously we had it separate, but it was separate at that point, but more that we integrated the more that really didn't actually work I don't think even for investors to understand what was going on. So we are challenging ourselves across the piece to give you more visibility into the overall dynamics.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger from William Blair. Sir, your line is now open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Given your success as you guys recently reported in the Drug Trend Report about really keeping trend down to a very low level, are you seeing any interest among clients for you to kind of go to the next step and give a full broad trend guarantee?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So what I would say, and I'm looking across at Dave here who's been with a lot of clients lately, I would not say at this point that we've seen a dramatic shift to that. I think it is something that we are well-positioned to potentially respond to as the market evolves because, again, we have great confidence in our programs and I would point out, while we don't necessarily see clients coming for overall trend guarantees, it's funny, what's old may become new because 18 years ago we were doing those at times.","The thing I know for sure is if you were to see our contracts, particularly with our larger clients where you've got the law of large numbers that you can use and large populations in therapeutic classes, we're doing a lot as it relates to guaranteeing outcomes of our programs across the board, whether that's our RationalMed program, whether it's our Diabetes Care Value Program, whether it's what a Retail 90 program would save incrementally to the share shift from 30 days, et cetera. Almost everything we bring to a client comes with a guarantee to that client of some sort of an outcome, either clinical or cost and in the best world, both. And so in that perspective we think, again, as we work with manufacturers to get to more value-based contracting and being able to bring incrementally even at the product level certain level guarantees, and we have a lung cancer drug now that if you drop-off in the first 60 days I believe, you get your money back. And so that's a drug level guarantee. So we're working every dimension of it we possibly can to help give our clients incremental cost certainty.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great, thanks. And then a second one, can you give us an update on the National Preferred Formulary. I think in the past that's been about 25 million numbers. Is that still about the right level or are you seeing participation among your clients grow?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I have sitting next to me here Everett Neville who is responsible for our supply chain and our specialty business and I will actually let him answer your question.","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Good morning. Yeah, it's very stable. It's around 25 million lives, very similar to last year.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones from Goldman Sachs. Sir, your line is now open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Actually just that Everett's there may be a follow-up question on the supply chain. I know you've been asked this question in the past, but I'm curious if there's any update around your distribution contract. Just, I think it's up this year, when should we expect to hear about a renewal decision and then any updated thoughts on whether or not you still feel you're fully leveraging your generic purchasing scale?","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So I'm going to give you an answer you probably expect. We remain in conversations. The conversations are productive. You should expect an announcement that we've renewed or haven't renewed when that actually occurs. That has not occurred at this point. As far as leveraging on the generics, we currently feel well leveraged, but that is something we evaluate constantly, at least every year.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. And then, Tim, I guess just to follow-up on the 2018 selling season line of questions. It sounds like not an out-sized year from a renewal perspective on a dollar amount. But could you talk a little bit about the configuration of what within your book is up for renewal this year? I think based on what we track it seems like you might have a few larger health plans up this year. I guess is that fair? And then any early thoughts on the renewal process around those important health plan clients?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. No, I would say actually \u2013 and we've \u2013 as you can imagine, those often get tacked down far in advance because to contemplate making a change requires more than the three or four months that you can move most other large employers, for example. And so I would say it's not at all outsized on any one of those. And I would also say that we've seen a little bit of \u2013 given the uncertainty around ACA and other things, we've seen in our book, and I suspect we may see it in the marketplace generally, the movement level will probably be lower, our plans wanting to extend. We're using the opportunity to help our plans to extend their contract with us over a longer period of time. So early renewing those plans and so forth has kind of kept them spread out. You may not have tracked some of that in your data. So, no bias toward a large health plan renewal. We have important health plans that we're going to renew this year, let me be clear. Or that we have already renewed and those are really important relationships to us, but there's not a disproportionate share of them this year up.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. That's helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut from Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, good morning. Tim, just to follow up again on the same line of questioning. Obviously it's what your clients view or clients think that matter the most. So what's the feedback so far from the consultant community in terms of all the discussions we're hearing on pricing and in terms of, also like how deeply do they understand the moving parts and understand the value that you bring to the table and how the discussion really is on net price and all these other things that you just mentioned?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I would tell you that \u2013 thanks for the question. I would tell you that that's the strange thing. I was asked by somebody recently, so how much are you having to talk your clients through some of the headline stuff. And the answer is, listen, the headline risk to your constituency investors in our company is what we're very concerned about because the facts just aren't getting out. I will tell you the great good news.","Again, it manifests itself in a good selling season last year, manifests itself in extraordinarily high retention, manifests itself in a very high satisfaction on our client surveys, is that this is not by and large a client issue. It's not to say clients don't force us to compete. They force us to compete. But I can tell you that the client conversations move very quickly to their spend, their trend, the programs they're in, the recommendations and ideas that we have for them, and there is just not time spent on sort of this debate.","Now, the folks will want to know, where do you think ACA is going? You know particularly our health plans; obviously we work very closely with them and their strategic planning. But the great good news is that our clients \u2013 and again, our Drug Trend Report last week was proof of it. We'll have our Drug Trend Report out in another month for our regulated business, our Med-D business and so forth, Medicaid. Again, I think what you'll see is we're getting results for our clients. So the conversation stays very focused on what we can do for them.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it. And then the last question for me. As we think about the guarantees that you're putting out there, whether it's diabetes and other therapies, how many more buckets of therapies do you think we can roll this out to over the next few years or maybe the point of asking that is how quickly can you ramp this up so that we can give more guaranteed programs to the client base?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So our rate limiters are two things. Our creativity and having pharma willing to support their products and to come forward in creative ways or to respond to our creative ideas as it relates to that. From that standpoint, I think over the next four, five years, first of all, again, the PCSK9 is a great example, our cardiovascular program is going to be completely invented. And it may get reinvented again as the market changes and all of these programs will be adaptive over time. So they're not sort of static and then you don't work them.","We know that in 2018 we have two additional areas. We haven't talked about which ones yet. We're still working with manufacturers and retailers to again, each one has a unique set of attributes that you then leverage. We have to leverage the specific dynamics and opportunities in a class we look forward so that we can think about how we manage that class over the longer term based on what we know is either happening or going to happen. And so, again, we see this as a great chassis and a great long-term runway for us in terms of how we contract with manufacturers, how we contracted retailers and ultimately how we help our clients get cost certainty.","But again to answer your question directly, two of them in 2018, incrementally and beyond that, we've got several other ideas.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Awesome. Thanks, Tim.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser from Morgan Stanley. Sir, your line is now open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So Tim, a question for you. With the health plan no longer on the table, how does that impact your strategic thinking? And would you add a health plan to your portfolio of assets? Would that make sense?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Good morning, Ricky and thanks for the question. So first of all, the first place that my head turns as it relates to the dynamics with the health plan sort of mergers that didn't happen is how can I help my clients stay focused and compete because obviously there's a lot of disruption going on now with the big four players, four of the big five players I guess. One of those is our client, Anthem, so I want to help them win and stay focused and have a great pharmacy program.","But then we've got a large book of health plans that I equally want to help have step in to the breach, offer certainty, offer focus, offer great pharmacy program and compete really effectively. So that's, but the starting point is I'd like to grow our existing health plan book of business by virtue of kind of harnessing the uncertainty that may exist with some of the other players as they sort of work through the last stages of their mergers dissolving.","In terms of the other question you asked, you obviously \u2013 you wouldn't expect me to comment very much. We like the business that we're in. We like very much the job that we do for health plans. We think that a number of the health plans who sort of we're going to get together that aren't are going to need help. We help health plans a lot of different ways. But again, I start with wanting to help Anthem grow their business and so forth and help our captive health plans grow their footprint and their credibility in their markets.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So when we think about the Anthem contract, I mean, obviously Anthem made some remarks in their conference call. So what's your latest thinking there and do you anticipate to be included in the initial RFP?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. So, our thinking there is Anthem is going through what I would have expected Anthem to go through absent the lawsuit or anything else, which is they're looking at the marketplace to determine what is the state of play in terms of services that a PBM provides to make sure that to the extent that we have the opportunity to sit down with them they've got some context. And so their RFP is out as we expected it would be. It's very heavily weighted toward understanding capabilities and guarantees and those sorts of things as well as pricing.","And the way I think about that is that we welcome the opportunity to sit down once they've done that and the good news is they know our capabilities, they know the 1\/1 we just delivered for them. They know the results that we've been able to achieve in helping them install Amerigroup. They know what we've been able to do as they've narrowed certain programs and used our tools. And so from our standpoint, I think that we stand very, very well positioned when they're ready to come and have a conversation about moving forward to the extent that happens.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey, good morning, Tim and team. Thanks for taking the question. I guess, Tim first on that 89% figure, the rebate share figure that you gave, does that include the fees in people who've preferred to take a structure as opposed to a rebate share or should we think of that number as conservative because there are people who are taking fees or some other type of payment that's not included in the 89% figure.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, what I'd tell you is rebates are really precisely defined and they are obviously negotiated hard. So if I understand your question, what I would say is, it is all rebate, all things that are governed around either market share movement or inclusion in a formulary and so forth. Now we certainly have things that we do that are governed by fair market pricing where we're paid to do a particular report or service and so forth for certain things. Those are relatively small, but those are not attributable to rebates. And so the 89% number is an all-in number.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then you kind of led down where my follow-up was going to go which is, how do I think about the shift away from rebate share to other fees and services charged by Express Scripts to clients? And I guess kind of what I want to think about is, can you kind of help us think about how that figure has grown? And like how often does Express Scripts get paid for not dispensing a drug, I think about something like a prior off that gets denied or where a script doesn't get filled and that would be a pretty profitable piece of business (53:28) pretty quick. So I guess, kind of help me think about the fees and other services parts of the business and its growth as a part of the mix and profitability to the degree to which you can?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah. It's important to us. And (53:41) continues to build out our clinical programs which we take the clients and do get paid fees for administering and usually guarantee, almost always guarantee the outcomes of those, are an important component of how we overall not only provide care, but also how we then profitably administer our clients' accounts. And align with our clients through those programs and you're right, prior offs and utilization management, Med D has sort of chosen to use prior offs rather than tighter formularies in a lot of cases. And so we are paid to administer those programs. As I've said we're paid to, for example, in PCSK9s to administer the tests that at least last year, physicians were still learning sort of which patients were appropriate for those products. And so we had a large percentage of the patients that should have been on those drugs not get those drugs, get more appropriate therapy and we \u2013 much less expensive therapy as well. But it was more appropriate and happened to be less expensive and we were paid to make those things happen.","And so from my perspective, again, it's part of the overall way that we work with a client. If we know a client is going to take a large basket of our managed approach, then we obviously discount more deeply those things than if they only take one of them for example. So we benefit our clients when they work with us more deeply to put those programs in place and they're meaningful to the overall value we create.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I guess no way to quantify that. That was like a contributor to profit growth or...","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No, because again, in some respects, we have clients that don't pay us for those programs because, for example, they let us keep some rebates. So they would rather share \u2013 I am making up \u2013 make up a number here, but it's pretty consistent. We will have a client who will say you can keep 10% of all the rebates that we together create, but I don't want to pay you for the RationalMed program and the Utilization Management Bundle that saves a lot of money now. With those clients, we will show them the results of those programs. They will know what we were paid by virtue of the rebates that we were to keep, because again, all of that is very transparent with these clients and auditable. So, it really does depend on how the individual client wants to work with us and pay us and it's not as simple as just breaking that out as a single line of business.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thank you.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So, we've got time for two more questions, operator.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken from Evercore. Your line is now open.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Good morning, guys and appreciate some of the incremental color. Tim, you talked about sort of a lot of the misinformation in the market and there's a lot of different constituents, whether it be folks in government that may not understand this model, folks at pharma with sort of some of their intentions, but the reality is it's brought in the investment community a lot of questions of what is the right margin profile, profit profile for this business. I guess as you've probably spent a lot of time thinking about this and how to show to us that the relevant savings are driving the customers versus the profits you're taking is in sort of the right dynamic. And obviously the market ultimately determines the value of what you do. What else have you sort of debated or what other things do you think you could share over time or when do you think you may have incremental transparency for us so that as we're looking at your profits in the context of what you're doing and the grand scheme of how much you're saving the clients, we can have some sort of tieback to say, okay, that's the right margin profile, that's the right profit dollar per script, that's the right fee, et cetera because I think that's where a lot of the debate continues to be.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","And thanks for your question, Ross. It's obviously not an easy question. What I'd say is there's an amazing amount of \u2013 first of all, you said it. So let me repeat it. We are in one of the most competitive businesses I know. And so our clients have great choices besides just us. We're in a competitive business. They have terrific choices. They have consultants a lot of the times that sort of add to the mix of evaluating us and ensuring that we make and keep meaningful promises to them. And so the market does work here. And I think the satisfaction with PBMs is high. If you look at the patients in Med D, satisfaction with PBMs is high and it saved a fortune. So I think there's a lot of stuff that you could point to. I point to our operating margin versus a \u2013 or our net income versus a pharma company's net income kind of stands on its own. No one writes about that. But again, I don't think our business over-earns as it relates to that. I look at our drug trend. We're pretty darn transparent as it relates to how we report drug trend which, again, for our clients is the result of the work we do. They know what they pay us. They know what they get in drug trend. And they can decide whether or not they're getting good value or not.","But, to your point, we continue to challenge ourselves to say is there something else we can put out there. You heard me say 89% today for rebates and the reason that I thought that was important is because I think there was a misperception as it relates to sort of that (58:36). But quite frankly, the real number that matters is 100% of the time our clients make the determination. I think the questions that need to be asked frankly need to be asked to the drug companies in terms of why they're raising their prices, why they're choosing to use rebates? And so from that standpoint, I think that we're not the only ones that should be answering these questions. But I like the fact that we create a very competitive marketplace and our ability to manage the supply chain end-to-end is very, very strong and our clients get that.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Maybe just a quick follow-up. Is there any way to help educate the consumer on this because, obviously, PBM traditionally you think of as more of a B2B business, although there are obviously B2C elements of it. Is there any way in your mind you think particularly around rebates or some of these other items that are more at debate that you think you guys can enable tools to help the consumer understand, look, this is what the gross price of the drug is, this is where really your out-of-pockets are falling, this is what your employer is paying, something to give them a fuller picture than what they see today?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","That is a great question. And I completely believe that there is a lot we have done there but there's more that we are doing there. By the way, it starts with working with our plans because we've had rebates at the point of sale for example, for 10 years. And we had less than 20 plans enrolled. But as I pointed out in earlier questions, I think our plans are re-looking at all of the dimensions of the plan designs, particularly as these integrated deductibles have created some unintended consequences. But helping the member understand that versus helping them navigate it are two different things and to your point, now we show our members what the plan pays and they pay today for example. They get to see that real-time.","Our digital and online tools are very strong in terms of showing different choices, both in terms of where they get their drug and what drug they're on versus one that would be a lower cost alternative. But I do believe to your point it is the place that we've got work to continue to do because by the way, the better job we do helping patients see that and participate in it, frankly it will lower our client's cost because those patients will navigate intentionally versus unintentionally to better choices.","Ross Muken - Evercore Group LLC","Thanks, appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Final question.","Operator","Yes, sir. Our last question comes from Michael Cherny from UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, and thank you for squeezing me in. A lot of stuff's been asked. I just want to go back to one topic I think you touched on, Tim, earlier regarding biosimilars. As you think about your role in biosimilars and you mentioned how from a focus point perspective that's something you'd love to see come across the market. What can you do as Express Scripts or maybe as PCMA from a lobbying group perspective to further educate in terms of the approval process given the new administration. How can you come up and drive some of the discussion around biosimilars that they become a broader part of the market versus what they are currently?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah, thanks for the question. As I said in my prepared remarks, there are \u2013 and I didn't put them all there. The things that we're advocating for, but we are strongly both as a company and through PCMA, and I appreciate you mentioning them because I should have earlier, we're very engaged leveraging our industry association as well as our own large footprint to advocate strongly.","And I think the most important thing we can do with the \u2013 among the most important things we can do with the new administration as well as folks at the state level is demonstrate what has been done already as it relates to generics, as it relates to creating competition. Because I'll tell you, folks often say, well, the bio-equivalents aren't going to be exactly the same as generics, so I don't take that point.","But even if they behave like a somewhat lower price competitive brand, they open the doors for us to start the spiral of price competition that ultimately moves to a very different place over a fairly short period of time, and what we're going to focus on doing as we engage with folks isn't just telling them that. It's showing them the case studies. It's bringing the voice of the payer into the room because our payers completely get it and understand the opportunity that if we can unleash these biosimilars will be created over time, just less than a half a dozen or half a dozen categories if you look at current expired patents, there's a ton of head room that we could be creating so that we can continue to have innovation that we can afford across our patient population.","So it is an important role that we're taking to advocate for them. We aren't betting on them. In our 2017 guidance I wish I could tell you that there's a strong bioequivalent contributor there and there's not. We're waiting. We've got a couple that we know are very close to the edge. But over the next five years, we're going to play a very strong role because it's going to help our clients stay in the game and be competitive.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Great.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","With that, I want to thank everybody for \u2013 I want to thank everybody for dialing in. We're proud of where we ended 2016. And again, I've mentioned our employees before. But from that standpoint we could not have hoped for a stronger contribution from our 26,000 employees and we all stay focused on our patients this year. We produced the result for our shareholders. And as we come into 2017, the unspoken thing about 2017 is you've seen our guidance. We have over a percent of EBITDA that is again going away as a result of Coventry and the Catamaran, and the final roll off of those two things.","And so we're again in 2017 very focused on backfilling to those headwinds and performing very, very strong for you, our investors, because we know this model over the long term is a model that produces tremendous value for the marketplace and it should produce tremendous value for you as well. And we are very focused on that.","With that...","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So just one last comment before we close. I just want to clarify one thing. Our blackout period opens at the end of this week in response to one of the questions on capital deployment from Bob Willoughby. I may have indicated end of the month, but the blackout period is the end of this week and we'll be back in the market purchasing shares at that time.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Absolutely. So thank you all for dialing in. Appreciate it. We'll talk to you next quarter.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's call.

If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect.","I would now like to turn over the call to Ben Bier, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Benjamin Bier - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, and good morning. With me today is Tim Wentworth, President and CEO; and Jim Havel, CFO.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor Statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations, or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties.

The press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at express-scripts.com.","At this point, I will turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. As I reflect on 2017, I'm proud of what we accomplished. First, we refocused on defining and expanding our core. In addition, we leveraged our tremendous assets to deliver strong financial results, a solid operational performance and innovation for patients and clients to keep them ahead of the curve.","In 2017, we delivered double-digit EPS growth; we achieved a record-low drug trend of 1.5%; we realized strong growth in our Accredo Specialty Pharmacy; we entered into new markets by launching new services and expanding our strategic platform with the acquisition of eviCore, the nation's leading medical benefit manager. We created and launched innovative programs focused on improving health outcomes and lowering costs, we maintained our discipline \u2013 a disciplined approach to cash deployment and cost management, and we began 2018 with a flawless 1\/1 implementation.","Now before we get started with our brief slide presentation, I want to address a few topics that are front and center. First, there is intense interest right now from patients, payers and policy makers about how to lower drug costs and maintain access. With the range of policy proposals released in the President's proposed 2019 budget, this need is top of mind for all, and we are contributing to the discussion.","In fact, many of the proposals, which appeared in the budget, were viable, cost-saving ideas we advocated for in our policy report released early this month, and this report can be found on our website and was released along with our 2017 drug trend results. These results clearly demonstrate the power of our innovative solutions in achieving our mission of making medicine more affordable for patients, clients and our country's taxpayers. We are proud of our long-standing advocacy for solutions that will help control prescription drug spending, but we believe there is more that can and should be done.","Second, I am pleased to announce additional investments in our employees and communities made possible in part by the passage of tax reform. Tax reform savings generated an opportunity to reward our most valuable assets, our employees, who work hard every day to serve our patients and clients, as well as to build strong relationships in our communities and create long-term shareholder value.","Non-executive employees will participate in a one-time bonus pool of approximately $20 million with each eligible employee receiving a bonus ranging from $500 to $2000 based on tenure, with an average bonus of $1200.","Additionally, approximately $30 million will be donated to benefit two specific initiatives. First, our employee's children; through creation of an education fund for them which would assist with post-secondary education including vocational education, community colleges and universities. Second, we will directly invest in our communities through a significant contribution to our charitable foundation.","Looking ahead, I'm also pleased to reaffirm our 2018 adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance of $9.27 to $9.47, which represents growth of 32% at the midpoint of our guidance.","Now, I will highlight the findings of our 2017 drug trend report, provide my perspective on why Express Scripts is the best choice for patients and clients and how we are poised for continued growth in 2019 and beyond. Then I will turn it over to Jim to discuss our financial performance.","In 2017, despite marketplace pressures, our solutions helped employers achieve a record low-drug trend of 1.5%. This drug trend consists of the year-over-year change in drug spending, net of rebates and includes changes in unit price, drug mix, and utilization. This compares favorably to the 2017 Consumer Price Index of 2.1% and our 2016 drug trend of 3.8%.","There are three other achievements of which we are extremely proud for 2017. First, some might surmise that our low trend means patients are paying more out of pocket, but that's not the case for most of our patients in an employer-provided benefit. In 2017, the average member out-of- pocket cost which includes deductible and co-pay for a 30-day prescription was $11.24, a $0.12 increase versus 2016.","Second, spending on specialty drugs, which accounted for 41% of total spending, was up 11% in 2017, the lowest increase we have seen. And this spend was driven by 8% higher utilization and 3% change in the average unit cost, driven lower through our SafeGuardRx value-based suite of solutions, such as our Inflammatory Conditions Care Value Program. And let me point out, our overall 1.5% trend includes spend for specialty drugs.","Finally, 44% of our clients spent less per person on prescription drugs in 2017 than in 2016. Let me say that again. These clients had negative drug trends. Our low 2017 drug trend is a direct result of our clients' willingness to work closely with us to develop and implement solutions that reduce costs while preserving access and enhancing quality. While I am proud of these findings, we also know that more work needs to be done, and we continue working on finding new solutions.","In fact, at Express Scripts, we will never sit still or assume our work is done. A core part of our heritage and ability to produce sustainable results is driven by our relentless focus on innovation to improve care, cost and access for patients. Over the years, we have developed numerous innovations. These include building the world's largest and most efficient ecommerce home delivery pharmacy with over 100 million annual prescriptions last year, the industry's only specialist pharmacy model our Therapeutic Resource Centers which drive deep clinical specialization across chronic and complex disease states. Our Accredo Rare Disease Pharmacy, which is the acknowledged leader in caring for the most complex diseases, achieving patient and provider NPS scores above 70.","And finally, launching the industry's most innovative approach to value-based contracting, an approach that not only broke the back of the price of costly hepatitis C treatments while ensuring patient access and superior clinical outcomes. But also, in the case of inflammatory conditions and multiple sclerosis demonstrated that payers can get their money back when drugs don't work.","More recently we are leading the charge on federal approval of biosimilars and are the first PBM to deliver an advanced opioid management program with proven results, developed in conjunction with our clients. We created a new model for groundbreaking gene therapies, and are now the innovative leader in helping health plans improve clinical outcomes on their medical spend through our industry-leading medical benefits manager business, eviCore.","These are just a few of the highlights which are innovative approach, has brought to the market, and looking forward, we see meaningful opportunities to continue to innovate on a lightweight capital frame in a way that produces meaningful and measurable results for the system. It is this approach, powered by over 27,000 committed employees, which drives our momentum as we move into 2018.","Speaking of 2018, we entered the year with strong market momentum and we continue to have success in retaining key clients. We create trusted client relationships by delivering exceptional care to patients while controlling costs, as our drug trend results clearly show.","A large part of our success is built on our clients' trust that we will focus 100% of our time on delivering clinical and financial outcomes for their employees and their families. As a result, we are pleased to be able to provide retention rate guidance for 2019 of 96% to 98%.","Interest in our solutions continues into the 2018 selling season, and we are seeing strong demand for many of them, including SafeGuardRx, our 90-day supply for chronic medications; exclusive Accredo Specialty Pharmacy; and specifically, our advanced opioid solutions. Through each of these programs as well as many others, we deliver superior care to patients at an affordable cost.","Our newest offering, as I mentioned before, our Multiple Sclerosis Care Value Program launched on January 1. This program extends our differentiated payment model by shielding payers from costs associated with discontinued therapy, and we have already enrolled over 22 million lives. It's our most successful launch to date.","In fact, most of our specialty SafeGuard solutions have enrolment of over 20 million lives. And we continue to enhance these solutions as we dynamically optimize the care and value we bring to the market.","These programs are also driving new sales momentum. While we do not discuss specific client wins, we are encouraged by our results and the conversations we are having with new clients as well as prospects. As we add up these factors, we are positioned to deliver claims and earnings growth in 2019.","With that, I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss our strong financial performance.","James M. Havel - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thanks, Tim, and good morning, everyone. As you saw in our earnings release, we reported strong fourth quarter and full-year consolidated and core results for 2017.","We reported consolidated adjusted fourth quarter earnings per diluted share of $2.16, which represents growth of 15% over the fourth quarter of 2016. The increase is driven by 5% growth in adjusted EBITDA, tax planning initiatives and management of our capital structure.","For the fourth quarter of 2017, our consolidated GAAP earnings per diluted share grew 75% largely due to the reduction in our deferred tax liability by $1.4 billion, resulting from federal tax reform enacted in December 2017.","For the fourth quarter, we adjudicated 355.8 million adjusted claims, slightly above our guidance range, generating consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $2.1 billion, up 5% over the fourth quarter of 2016. In line with our expectations, our core business adjusted EBITDA also grew 5% during the quarter, growing $1.5 billion over the fourth quarter of 2016.","Consolidated adjusted SG&A ramped up in the fourth quarter of 2017 and increased 16% versus the fourth quarter of 2016. This was the result of increased project spending in the fourth quarter as we focused on enhancing technology capabilities to drive value for patients, clients and providers. At the same time last year, spending was slowed as we worked on our multiyear roadmap for the company.","In the fourth quarter, we generated $1.4 billion of cash flow, which was in line with our expectations, but 39% less than the fourth quarter of 2016 due to the timing of receipt of tax benefits and payment of transaction costs and payables.","For the full-year 2017, we generated $7.10 of consolidated adjusted earnings per diluted share, which represents growth of 11% over the full-year 2016. The increase is driven by the 2% growth in adjusted EBITDA, tax planning initiatives and management of our capital structure.","Consistent with our fourth quarter results, the full-year 2017 GAAP earnings per diluted share of $7.74 increased 44% versus 2016, largely driven by the reduction in our deferred tax liability from application of federal tax reform enacted in December 2017.","Our consolidated adjusted claims for the year were 1.4 billion, relatively flat compared to prior year and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our core business adjusted claims were consistent with our expectations at 1.2 billion.","We generated consolidated adjusted EBITDA of $7.4 billion in 2017, up 2% and slightly above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our core business adjusted EBITDA grew 3% to $4.9 billion, in line with our expectations. The growth in the core business adjusted EBITDA was driven by supply-chain management, specifically relating to generic procurement sourcing, strong growth in specialty and clinical upsells of our new solutions.","2017 consolidated adjusted SG&A increased 2% versus the prior year, in line with our expectations. Full-year net cash flow from operations was $5.4 billion, an increase of 9% versus 2016. In 2017, we deployed $7.5 billion of cash, including $3.5 billion for strategic acquisitions, $2.9 billion to repurchase common stock and $1.1 billion to retire debt. Overall, we delivered on our 2017 expectations and are proud of our strong financial performance.","Turning now to 2018, our consolidated and core business annual guidance remains unchanged from that we provided in January 2018. We continue to expect to realize core business adjusted EBITDA of $5.325 billion at the midpoint of the range, up nearly 8% over our core business 2017 adjusted EBITDA. And we expect consolidated adjusted earnings per diluted share to be $9.37 at the midpoint.","The guidance reflects the implications of the tax reform enacted in December 2017. As Tim mentioned, the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act provides us with an opportunity to share a portion of the tax savings with our staff and the communities in which we operate. We are proud to share the savings provided by the tax reform package to reward our employees for their hard work and dedication to serving our patients and clients.","We remain focused on growing our operating cash flow and on our disciplined capital deployment strategies. In 2018, we expect to generate strong operating cash flow of approximately $5.8 billion to $6.3 billion. Our guidance assumes we will use approximately 25% of our cash flow to repay debt, 8% to 10% towards CapEx and investments to support our enterprise value initiative, and 40% to 50% allocated to share repurchases. The remainder of our cash flow will follow our usual capital priorities.","Additionally, our enterprise value initiative plans for 2018 have not changed. We expect to invest approximately $140 million in 2018 and realize $65 million to $75 million of savings in 2018, impacting both our core business and transitioning clients' expenses.","For the first quarter of 2018, we are forecasting consolidated adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.73 to $1.78 per share. The quarterly trend for our adjusted earnings per diluted share is expected to be similar to what we experienced in 2017. As in previous years, we are expecting a higher earnings ramp in the back half of 2018 as throughout the year, we realize higher utilization of our clinical programs, increased penetration of generics across our book of business, and benefits from our supply chain initiatives.","Before I turn the call back to the operator for Q&A, let me take a minute to mention our upcoming Investor Day. As we announced last week, we will be holding an Investor Day on Wednesday, May 2 in New York City. We hope you will join members of our leadership team for a deeper dive into our outlook for the future, our strategy for creating value for patients, clients, and shareholders, and why we are the best position to take on and tackle the toughest challenges in health care.","With that, I will turn the call over to the operator for questions. Thank you.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. Thanks very much for all the commentary. Tim, let me start with the selling season. So you're talking about retention rates 96% to 98%, 60% complete. Is it that you have a lot of the larger accounts? Or how do I think about that 60%? Is that based on claims? Is it based on the number of accounts? That's the first question.","And then, secondly, can you just walk us through what you're seeing in the selling season around cross-sell for eviCore? You talked about the care value around multiple sclerosis, but what are you seeing through the SafeGuard programs, Accredo, et cetera? Just trying to get a feel for what we could see in 2019 around EBITDA growth related to renewals, as well as new business wins.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thanks, Lisa, and good morning. So, first of all, the first part of your question around retention. So clearly, to have the line of sight that we have now is terrific and we worked really hard with our clients over the last several years to develop and put programs in place that have made our clients very sticky to us. It's not that they don't demand competitive offerings. They do, and we're providing those.","And so at this point, to your point, the large health plans, as well as, frankly, the majority of the large employers have for 1\/1\/2019, renewals have been secured or we're in a very confident position with them, working through the last point. So we're in great shape on that, and that's why we're able to give the guidance a quarter earlier than we would normally.","As it relates to the cross-selling, it's a little early to be cross-selling eviCore. What I'd say is eviCore is performing extraordinarily well on its own, has a very robust pipeline of opportunities, has continued to perform and deliver on its value proposition really well to its clients. The more we've gotten to see their business and understand it, it's a tremendous job they do for their clients.","We have had \u2013 and Dave Queller is here today, but we've had our teams get together to look at our joint clients and things we can do for them particularly quickly. But longer term, Dr. Miller, John Arlotta and the whole team are plotting a whole series of things that over the next 18 months we're going to be able to roll out. So while it's still early, our clients are interested, they're excited. Again, many of them use eviCore already and those that don't, are very interested to understand the proposition, particularly with the PBM.","That said, the programs that we more traditionally have been talking with clients about and developing in conjunction with them have come out of the box very strongly this year. And so we continue \u2013 as I've told you, we launched our MS1 through 1 January and we already have clients representing 22 million lives and a robust pipeline of additional conversations there. Our opioid program continues to gain a significant traction, and our longer-term programs continue to as well as we go out to clients, where we may have had to customize those programs for some health plans. We're seeing, again, an amazing amount of additional uptake.","And I would point to something like the Cardiovascular Care Value Program, when you see where we've been able to help our clients and take risk on the PCSK9s, there's going to be an opportunity there, for example, for clients to rethink that program and us to rework with them again as the NASH indication that comes out over the next 24 months or less. And so we see, again, an opportunity to dynamically work with the clients that are in these programs as we bring others in.","And, finally, because you mentioned it, the Accredo business is performing very, very well and we have had a number of clients already narrow, again, to exclusive Accredo, not just through our SafeGuard program, but also as a stand-alone opportunity.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's helpful. And then, secondly, Tim, the $20 million observing that for the bonuses within your current guidance, can you talk about what you're seeing in the business that gives you the comfort to be able to offset that? One.","And two, we've heard from some others that they need to raise minimum wages. Do you need to go beyond this bonus and the philanthropic side of offering education, et cetera, to your employees? Or do you not have a lot of minimum wage employees that you would have to raise wages on?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I'll start, and I'll let Jim jump in. So a number of things give us the confidence to essentially not change our range or the midpoint of our range of our guidance. First of all, we have a strong 1\/1 as I mentioned, and so we're able to bring those resources down to a more normal operating level more quickly. Even then, we would have anticipated in our more aggressive assumptions.","Secondly, I fundamentally believe \u2013 and the e-mails I've received from employees already convince me, that when you treat employees right, they're more productive. And I fundamentally believe in the way we think about the world is when you invest in employees, you see it in productivity. And so I fully anticipate that a large part of the investment that we're making in these bonuses will come back in incremental productivity above our plans, who our leaders and our employees engaging differently.","And as it relates to minimum wage, to your point in your question, that's not something that we have as much exposure to. We don't operate retail stores and so forth, and so our employees \u2013 that's not been an issue. We pay competitively. We look at our local markets. We're dynamic in that both in terms of benefits and compensation. For example, this year we added paid family leave for both fathers and mothers, so we're dynamic about that. We didn't need a tax increase to make sure we treat our employees well.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks, Tim. I'm sorry. Go ahead.","James M. Havel - Express Scripts Holding Co.","And, Lisa, let me address your first question about why we didn't change our guidance. Effectively, we have a back door raise here because we are going to absorb the $20 million into our numbers and not adjust guidance down at all for that. And we're off to \u2013 you said why would you do that? We're off to a tremendous start. Our 1\/1 was executed flawlessly. It was just as strong and as good as it's ever been and that allowed us to make some adjustments to our operating structure and operating expenses quite early on in the process.","Also, as Tim pointed out the selling season, the renewal season in particular has been outstanding. We have lots of optimism as we look forward. We've got the lives we need, we're going to get the utilization we want. So we really feel we're well-positioned to do this.","And I agree, I echo Tim's comments in terms of the minimum wage comment. I would also tell you that our senior staff when designing this program was very interested in rewarding, to the extent we can, those folks who have been around and served us for a long time and have stuck with us over the years and that's why that bonus was based a lot on tenure. And I think that was really an important point that our senior staff wanted to make with our team. And again, our folks are experienced, they've been around. They've done great work for us for many years, and this is just a real small token of our appreciation for what they do for us.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Well, keep the momentum going in 2018.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","You bet.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Tim, could you talk a little bit more about how you're thinking about integrating eviCore with the core PBM business? And what sort of metrics will you be giving us going forward so that we can kind of track the cross-sell opportunity?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, so what I'll tell you is, we \u2013 I'm not prepared to give you exact metrics yet. I mean you'll see in our other business operations, it's going to be dominated by eviCore and so you'll be able to see how pretty good read through in terms of how eviCore is performing, because of course UBC is no longer in there. We do have our Specialty distribution business in there, so that's also there. But we're still working through that and I would point to our Analyst day will be a good opportunity for us to probably ground you in how we're thinking about it. It's still too early for me to give you a lot there.","As it relates to though what we're thinking about it, what could be done with the combination. Again, I don't want to get too far out ahead of our skis in terms of the conversations we're having. And frankly, we're talking with clients first to make sure that our thinking is square. But we do think that the combination, for our health plans and our ASO knowledge we think a lot of our health plans, ASO clients, we could help our health plans drive that through to their marketplaces by tweaking some of these products a bit. We also think that there's a really interesting network strategy potentially using eviCore's business and so forth.","And so, Steve's here and he's been directly integrating with eviCore, looking at the drug spend on the medical side and other things. Steve, I don't know if there's other things you want to add.","Steven B. Miller - Express Scripts Holding Co.","The only thing I'd add is when you think about the data that they hold servicing almost 120 million people, and what Express Scripts holds. This is actually a phenomenal platform for the future to manage across the full spectrum of medical and pharmacy spends. So when you think about solutions that the country's looking for, to end fragmentation, and to really facilitate better care at a lower cost we're just very excited. So we look at this more as a collaboration than an integration. And collaborating with them I think we're going to achieve some great things.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks very much. Maybe a quick follow-up on the core PBM business, as you're engaging in some of these early renewal discussions. Are kind of risk-sharing trend guarantees becoming a bigger thing? I assume that's a pretty significant competitive advantage for you. I'm just curious if it's starting to become part of the renewal package, so to speak?","Steven B. Miller - Express Scripts Holding Co.","It has not as of sort of as we sit here. We take plenty of risks in terms of our performance and our ability to deliver good financials and so forth, but in terms of the kind of things you're implying, I would not say that's the case today. I would also tell you though that as I look out over the next three years, I think that's a very meaningful opportunity that we see.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Erin Wright with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Great. Can you elaborate some more kind of on the opportunity with biosimilars? We've obviously been talking about that for a long time, and maybe we're at sort of a next step in sort of that opportunity? And maybe some of maybe the near-term opportunities? And then what you see on the longer-term horizon on that front? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I'll start, and then I'll have Everett jump in as well. So the short answer is it's frustrating, and we've been very, very vocal about that in terms of the fact that the true biosimilars are being held up in courts and it could be as long as until the end of 2022 into 2023 before we see a meaningful biosimilar in our country. I would point out that they're working really well in other places.","That being said, in the meantime years and leading up into this year in fact, specialty generics, which are different obviously than biosimilars, have become an important dynamic year-over-year as we work to drive the kind of drug trends that we talked about earlier in our prepared remarks.","And so when I'm looking backward at things like GLEEVEC for the treatment of certain types of cancer or looking forward this year, for example, to COPAXONE 40 and to potentially TRACLEER and a couple of other drugs, we see opportunities to meaningfully go at the broadly-defined specialty space even as we wait for a true biologic equivalent to come to market, which we are very excited about.","Everett, do you want to add any additional color there?","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, I don't have a lot to add, Tim. But certainly, there are some biosimilars coming in the short-term. We expect Neulasta probably by the end of the year, early next year. We've seen some in the medical space that play a little bit in the pharmacy space, but agree that the real products that we're looking forward to like HUMIRA may be as late as 2023. They could come earlier if someone goes at risk.","Our short-term focus, though, is primarily on the generic products. We have several generic launches every year. As we look out to the next three, four years, that will be impactful.","And then the last thing I would add is that our formation of Valium Rx was primarily strategically done in order to position ourselves to get us the leverage that we believe we'll need to negotiate for biosimilar agreements. We expect the biosimilar agreements to look something like brand agreements and something like generic agreements, so somewhere in between those. And we're positioning and laying our plans to take advantage of that when they happen.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay, great. And how much is sort of the medical benefit kind of limitation on that front versus like interchangeability, definitions and how does kind of maybe eviCore position you in that respect?","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So to date on the medical side, that has certainly been a barrier. Given the reimbursement structure, there's not a lot of incentive on the medical side. That is something we're focused on and believe with eviCore that we will be able to address more completely in the coming years.","We are making some small progress. Some of these products are maybe 10% so far on the pharmacy side. We can expect to see that slightly grow, but again, the real payoff for us is when we get to the larger products such as HUMIRA, Enbrel, the MS products that appear to be coming sometime around 2022, 2023, 2024.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Excellent. Thank you.","Operator","The next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Yes. Hey. Thanks for taking the questions. I had a question about \u2013 it looks like the margins, obviously, were better than, I think, people were expecting. And I think to a certain extent, you talked about the clinical programs helping to drive that. Can you talk about what the penetration in your client base of these programs are sort of roughly today and where you think they can \u2013 sort of where the upper limit on that penetration could be?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. So I'll start. I mean, I think it depends on the program, but I would tell you the SafeGuard programs I think are \u2013 as I told you, we've got plans with well over 20 million lives in the majority of those programs now actually I believe.","And from a standpoint of room to run, we still believe we have room to run. Again, there are a lot of reasons that clients \u2013 they do require these programs. A certain level of benefit changes as it relates to narrowing to Accredo, for example, for certain of the programs, or narrowing to certain retailers for Diabetes Care Value Program. And so we continue to see not a trickle but a good strong stream of continued interest in it. And I think we could easily over the next three years see a doubling of these things.","And again, the other piece is we've done a great job of driving a technological approach to what we do that's lightweight and it allows us to be far more nimble as we customize these programs, particularly for health plans who really want to put their brands on them and go and compete. And I'm in receipt of a \u2013 I'm actually sitting here and I was sharing with my team a brochure from HealthNow in upstate New York where they actually published a brochure on the value of integration and they talk all about our programs in there. And we're really proud with the fact that we've been able to adapt our programs to go and help them win in their markets and carve back in the people that \u2013 their clients. And so it really does depend.","I would tell you with Accredo, in our commercial book of business, we've got deep penetration. We're probably north of 70%, and maybe as close as 80%, but we probably are not quite half yet in our health plans. But I would also tell you if you looked at the growth of Accredo this year, both standalone health plans and PBM client health plans, that's been the key driver of our growth and continues to be as we look over the next 18 months and look at the number of conversations that we're in.","So plenty of room to run, and again, continued opportunity to build-out additional programs as the market evolves.","James M. Havel - Express Scripts Holding Co.","And, Charles, that last point Tim made is absolutely key. While 2017 was a record year for what we call upsells, and that's really how we think of these, we're going to see the benefits of those sales into 2018 and beyond, certainly, but the thing to remember is these programs are not static. They change. And as the program runs and is successfully continues to run, but then our teams are constantly behind that generating new programs and new opportunities to benefit the patients. And so don't think of it just in terms of a static number of programs and they're going to hit a cap and that's going to be the end of it. This program is going to continue to run for us.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","That's helpful. Thanks a lot for that. Just maybe one follow-up related to some of the budget proposals. I think, in particular, when we look at some of these states looking for waivers to implement some formularies, can you talk about sort of what the opportunity there is for you? Right now, it looks like states will try to do it on their own. It's not clear what the language exactly looks like, or at least I'm not fully aware of it, but maybe you could help us understand sort of how you're positioning yourselves for sort of this Medicaid opportunity, should this be allowed. Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. And what I would tell you is at least in the initial situation, we have clients who compete in Medicaid and who we will be helping take advantage of incremental flexibility whether that be on formularies and so forth.","I would back up, though. One of the things that I think is important across the regulated program is we've been advocating for the ability to do value-based contracting and not trip over certain things that today make that harder for a manufacturer to support, relative to best price and other things. And so that's beyond just the state budget issue. That's also a Medicare for our clients that are in Medicare.","And what I'd broadly say is this. I think in the short-term the states have a lot to think through, and again, we'll support our clients to the extent they compete there. We haven't been too much of a player on the direct basis for state Medicaid. But longer term, the adoption of commercially proven programs and approaches in the regulated marketplace is something that we just broadly advocate, both at the state level and at the federal level, and we'll continue to. Around formulary management, around retail network management, around utilization management, around dynamic things, taking advantage of opportunities when they arise, not having to have them wait for as long as potentially 18 months. And so I would say broadly speaking, we are all for things that allow tighter management. And frankly, when you look at state budgets across the country, there's no question in my mind that they're going to need the kind of tools that we will provide to our clients that compete in that Medicaid space.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Nephron Research. Your line is open.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Thank you. A question on the cost reduction program, maybe on the expense side versus the investment side. What are some of the items, Jim, that you're taking on as we progress through the year? Where will you see benefits? And does Anthem taking on some responsibilities in advance of 2020 have a meaningful impact?","James M. Havel - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, Anthem certainly has a meaningful impact. As they run their business and decide that they're going to do function A, B, or C, then we need to be responsive to that, certainly, and so that gives us an opportunity on the expense side to really take out costs. So for example, if they take a greater role in prior authorizations for example, then we take less of a role and we can eliminate those costs from our structure.","Similarly, if they choose to take on other things, within the terms of the contract, we can certainly adjust to it. So we're constantly looking to compress our operations and our cost structure to make sure it matches up so we can serve the Anthem patients but at the same time anticipate as we get to the end of that contract.","At the same time, when you take a look at our business, we also have to make sure that our business is streamlined such that we can be more responsive and most responsive to our patients and our providers and what they're really looking for there is digital interface. They don't \u2013 I mean, they don't really want to spend a lot of time on the telephone talking to us. They don't want to send us a lot of paperwork. What they really want to do is operate online so we need to be completely responsive to that. We need to be better \u2013 even better at ePA. We need to be even better at managing electronic records. We need to be even better at digital communications and self-service tools. And that's the type of investment, if you will, that we're making but the benefits from that are going to be absolutely tremendous as we, again, are able to take out some of those touchpoints, because our clients and our providers will get better service no question about it, but at the same time we're going to be saving some costs associated with it. Does that get to your point, Eric?","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","Yes. And relative to Anthem, does that mean that in 2018 and 2019 we'll see them take on responsibilities, the revenue is the revenue and that doesn't change, but some of the costs related to serving and the contract are moving before we get to 2020?","James M. Havel - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Not necessarily. We're certainly going \u2013 we're going to have to be responsive for the services we provide. And so where contractually we provide the services and then we expect to be paid for those services, and that's really how you have to think of it and how you match up. So this isn't a set fee, if you will, or set revenue over the period of performance.","You're seeing \u2013 for example, you're seeing Anthem pull out of some of the exchanges so some of the lives are going down. And so, naturally, the revenues will go down and the costs associated with meeting those revenue requirements will also go down. So you're going to see \u2013 it's truly \u2013 we refer to it as transitioning for a reason. They really are transitioning. We have to remain responsive to their needs and their patients' needs, in particular, but we will be responsive to that and we'll adjust as we go.","Eric Percher - Nephron Research LLC","That's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes. Thanks, and good morning. Hey, Tim. I just wanted to follow-up on this year's selling season. I mean, it sounds like the company is having some early success and I'm just kind of curious could you maybe comment on the CVS-Aetna situation and that dynamic, and is that playing a part at all in the conversations? Or has your success been more independent of that than maybe we appreciate? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. Thanks, Glen. So what I'd say is it's way too early for CVS-Aetna to have had any real impact. I mean, the wins that we've had were things that we were prospecting a year ago or more. One of them was, it's now public. It's a state in the Northeast. That was \u2013 I don't think that they were all that worried about that. They were looking to who's going to manage their trend better, who's going to give them a price that sort of is competitive, and service that feels durable. And so I would tell you that one, a couple of the other larger wins that we've had would not have had that as a meaningful dynamic.","And I think, again, what I think the meaningful dynamic is we're getting results for clients. They're talking about it. We did, as I've said in earlier calls, revamped significantly our approach to going to the market and selling and winning, and I think that's what's driving it. And so to the extent that CVS and Aetna is out there, I'm sure it's a conversation point with some of our sales folks, but I will tell you, my belief is that we have to focus on our attributes, where we can help a client, where we can win, or help them win, and the rest takes care of itself.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. And maybe just one follow-up on the 2019 selling season. I mean, as we think about a multiyear roadmap, in the past, you've sort of commented about the total number of scripts that were out for rebid for 2018 and 2019 combined. Can you maybe give us an update there and maybe give us a sense for how much of that business may be yours that's out for rebid at this point, so we have an opportunity to think about how that could play out over the next couple of years?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. What I would tell you is as you can imagine this year, for 1\/1\/2019 by now what's out there for us is fairly a low as far as what's in our range, it wasn't where we started, but we started sort of normal. But, again, we've been very successful in not only renewing, but in almost every case strategically enlarging our relationship, while we renewed, whether that's Accredo or other things.","As we look at 2019, what I would do is characterize the amount of business to renew out there is on the normal to low-normal side. So, again, we do not have a larger-than-typical bolus that would be up for 1\/1\/2020.","Glen Santangelo - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for taking the questions. Actually, I just wanted to start on mail in specialty revenue. Actually, seeing slight declines there in the last two quarters, which I think is somewhat surprising, especially, Tim, in light of some of the comments you made about how well Accredo has been performing. And so just curious if maybe you could spend a little time talking about what you're seeing within mail, separately from what you're seeing within specialty.","And then, just any thoughts, again. I know you get this question from time to time, maybe it will come again at the Analyst Day, but any thoughts about breaking out those two buckets just to get a little bit more visibility?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. So let me first say that to the first part, what you're seeing is combined script \u2013 specialty is not going down. In fact, we grew our specialty last year faster than the market, both EBITDA and volume. So \u2013 but mail is, and of course specialty is such a small percentage of the number that frankly if it's up or down it wouldn't drive what you'd probably see materially.","Mail is down sequentially in the last two quarters because of the mid-year losses that we had, a couple of whom had fairly high mail penetration. And so even as we were implementing more members at mail and putting our omni-channel programs in, you had that headwind in mail. But specialty has grown very, very well.","And again, mail it's taking a bit of a breather in terms of growing because of we've really focused on our 90-day omni-channel programs. We believe over the longer term, those position us well for patient choice, where the patient will be able to exercise their preference, and where the channel will deliver an incredibly strong experience. But again, with those client losses it was more than we were going to overcome in the short-term.","James M. Havel - Express Scripts Holding Co.","And Robert, just let me add-on in terms of ever breaking that out, as we look at both specialty and mail, those are absolutely embedded in our PBM operations, and we don't break them out internally, and we're not going to break them out specially or attempt to break them out because there would be way too many estimates and way too many interactions of the rest of the business involved. So we do describe and release information on the claim volume, but we will not be breaking those out in the future in terms of a segment or other type of operation.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I will say that at Analyst day we're going to give you a much deeper look at specialty, and we're still looking through sort of how to best be able to demonstrate in a way that you'll be able to appreciate sort of our standalone \u2013 I said standalone \u2013 sorry our Accredo Specialty growth and proposition.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","No, that's helpful. Definitely look forward to that. I think just on the surface, seeing the overall revenue number down in the last two quarters, I think, is what probably stuck out most. But I understand that there's some attrition behind the scenes there as well. I guess just as a follow-up, it sounds like you guys have Everett and Dr. Miller in the room. So just going back to some of the biosimilar comments from before, and specifically related to the announcement of the JV purchasing on specialty drugs with Walgreens. I was just wondering if maybe you could take a step back and give us a sense of what really the play is here with combining the specialty volume with Walgreens?","I think from our standpoint we always thought the value really that you guys drive on brands, and even biosimilars really at this point has really been through formulary. So just curious if you could elaborate a little bit on the decision to combine your purchasing with Walgreens?","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. This is Everett. I'll take that. A couple of things. We do expect some modest improvement in our purchasing brands from combining the volume. So that's the near-term. The long-term play with biosimilars, as we look out to biosimilars, we think that a large component of it will be brand-like, i.e. formulary driven, but when you get into multiple biosimilars which is the likely scenario, four, five, manufactures making a biosimilar, pharmacy preferred drugs will be a component of that, so there will be some pharmacy decision as far as which products are stocked and carried at pharmacies. And the combined effect of those will be what drives the cost on the biosimilars. But also point out that Walgreens does have some highly-controlled managed segments that they have, that also we would look to coordinate our actions with.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","And, Robert, I want to step back just for a quick second because as you were transitioning your question, you used the word revenue rather than claims. And what I would say revenue, the other thing I'd point to is that mail, we saw a 200 basis point increase in generics which would be driving that revenue down. That's obviously us doing our job and so forth, and so that would have also attributed to the revenue drop.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Appreciate that, Tim. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from George Hill with RBC. Your line is open.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Good morning, guys. I think a lot of the key topics have been \u2013 I guess I would just talk on when we look at kind of the White House document that came out earlier, the idea of point-of-sale rebates and drawing a more direct line between the cost of the consumer and the cost of the drug, and the economics of the drug and the rebate seem to have some traction at the federal level. I guess are you seeing any demand for that type of reimbursement change in commercial books, whether it be risk or ASO?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No, I would say not at all. What I would say is it did appear in the letter as you say and it's, obviously, been a talk track in Washington that pharma has been putting forward to draw attention away from their price increases. I think there was an article yesterday in Politico that showed that I think there's an increasing sort of deafness to some of those arguments, but it doesn't mean that the rebates at point-of-sale aren't being considered.","What I would say is this, it's really important patients get what they need, can afford it, and stay on it, right? And I think we all can agree on that and it's really important to look for ways to ensure that. That's why we are so strong in the patient assistance programs at Accredo and other things, but as we look at the commercial market and the specific thrust of your question, we have simply not seen a material interest at the commercial level or frankly at the health plan level.","We do have some in their particular markets or with specific plan designs where they prefer to do it, but you've not seen it as a major move yet. You've seen clients talking about co-pay caps and certain other things, but at least at this point, I would tell you the market broadly, and our view as to what is sort of \u2013 Med D is a popular program. It's coming under its core budget and so forth. Keeping the premiums low for all of the patients that have been so happy has continued to be the goal of most of the plans.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. And then...","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","By the way, there's no question for us \u2013 and I think I've said this before, it doesn't produce an incremental headwind as it relates to our business model. We've been doing rebates at point-of-sales since the mid-2000s. We've actually revised that to be an even more user friendly and precise and digital sort of approach for plan. So we're ready to go if it were to go that way, but we do believe it's up to the plan to determine how they want to go out and compete.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","No, that's helpful. And maybe a quick housekeeping question for Jim. Jim, just if I look at the transitioning client business in the back half of the year, I guess is there anything you can tell us about the non-Anthem business as opposed to the Anthem business, and how it trends in the back half versus the first half?","James M. Havel - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yeah. Pretty much the non-Anthem business has virtually disappeared when you start 2018. There is a little bit of residual that will flow into the year. But by and large, when you think about the transitioning clients at this point, you almost have to think of client and it's almost exclusively Anthem for the rest of 2018 and beyond.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Okay. But like, I guess, all the per claim metrics in that part of the book probably didn't change much in the back half of the year versus the first half.","James M. Havel - Express Scripts Holding Co.","That's right.","George Hill - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning. So CVS-Aetna would likely have to divest some Part D business. Is this an area of interest for you?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So thanks for the question, Ricky. What I would say is this. We are very proud of the work that we do in our PDP. We think it helps us eat our own cooking in terms of all the clients that we help compete in that marketplace in our MAPD products as well as their PDP products. And so to the extent \u2013 and we've had a really successful enrollment year this year in that we launched a new line, a value line there and came in at the very high side of our expectations in terms of enrollment growth there, which is a positive.","And so what I would tell you is, to the extent that there was a meaningful book of business coming out to the market, as we would look at anything coming to the market in any of the spaces we compete in, we would take a look.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And when we think about the selling season and retention rate, and what it means for next year, within that range of 96% to 98% retention, where do you need to end the year at so to see script growth in 2019?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, obviously, that's a function of the success we have in sales, as well as, frankly, how we help our health plans grow their books of business. What I would tell you is this. I think if anywhere in that range, we have the potential to come in and show claims growth. It's tougher at the bottom, but it depends also on a couple large sales, which I can't sit here and guarantee to you.","But that range gives us room, given the sales success we've had so far, some of the new markets we've entered including cash and other things. As you may know, now, we're in the pet market and we'll see how that goes. It's kind of a fun place for us to leverage our scale at no capital investment to speak of, but with some great leadership in our company and some possible ideas there.","So, there are a number of ways that we think we can get to claims growth even if we came in at the lower end of that range, which my intention is to not come in at the lower end of the range, but it's a little early to declare that.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. Your line is open.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Hi. This is Elizabeth Anderson in for Ross. One thing that caught my interest recently was the new specialty buying group that you announced with WBA. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color on the genesis of that and what your goals and you see the competitive advantage of that organization being. Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I'll let Everett take that.","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. And just to reiterate, I think not a whole lot more to say about that. It is just the combining of the purchasing for Walgreens' various specialty pharmacy arrangements, as well as ours. We expect some modest improvement in the purchasing side. It's primarily strategically positioning ourselves for some biosimilar negotiations, which we expect to begin to happen as early as this year, and certainly to pick up speed as we head toward 2023.","Elizabeth Anderson - Evercore Group LLC","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Next question comes from Brian Tanquilut with Jefferies. Your line is open.","Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC","Hey. This is Bryan Ross on for Brian Tanquilut. Just a quick one on the procurement side. I know you've already touched on specialty with Valium Rx. And now that you're part of WBAD, have you started to see a lift in generic purchasing savings this year? How material are those savings? And is there any ramp to those as we move throughout the year?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, I'll start real quickly and just say we came into this year very strong. Our team led by (55:38) did an amazing job last year before we entered into the GPO, positioning us very strongly with our generic bid. And so that carries us into this year with great momentum. And obviously, the GPO gives us opportunities both to look at each other's contracts, but also to go back out and create value, which is a bit of a longer-term prospect. And I'll let Everett give you sort of the latest on that.","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. So, at this point in time, the WBAD accommodation has largely optimized the combined contracts. So we are seeing value from that already. Their process is kind of a continuous negotiation process, so that's already begun. We are at the top end of the range of value that we expected for 2018, and so that's coming online. And again, as we expected, maybe even a little better. That should continue to grow in the out-years.","Bryan Ross - Jefferies LLC","Okay. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Next question comes from Michael Cherny with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys, and thanks for the question. A lot of topics have been discussed. I just want to touch on Inside Rx. I know it's another one of the programs you've been talking about in terms of driving differentiation savings. Can you talk about or give any update on what type of tax rate you've had, what the interest level is in some of those programs, and over time how you see that program evolving?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. And, again, I'm going to let Everett, who's sort of really with his team developed it, although my top-line comment would be it's a really good reflection of how the independent model can go and create value. Nobody was getting rebates at the point-of-sale for these, and now they are. And I'm not going to suggest that the tail is going to wag the dog, but pets could be really interesting there too, because there are an underserved folks there.","With that, I'm going to pass it over to Everett.","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. So this time last year, we had zero cash claims. We expect in 2018 to be somewhere between $10 million and $20 million cash claims, so the interest is actually pretty significant and we're still in the learning phase, making some decisions on should we expand or deploy our footprint in that space.","Michael Cherny - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So with that, operator, we'll take one more question, please.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from David Larsen with Leerink. Your line is open.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Congrats on a good quarter. Can you maybe talk a bit about like these co-pay accelerator programs that I've been hearing about, where health plans in some cases are not allowing patient assistance programs to count towards their deductibles. Have you seen this? And what role does Express Scripts have in that? And what does that do to your earnings, if anything?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, actually, I'll start with letting actually Dr. Miller talk about it from an impact in the health plan. What I'd say from an earnings standpoint is it's non-material to nothing. Our job is to get patients on a drug, help them stay on the drug, and if they're entitled to something to get it. But, Steve, do you want to talk more? Or Brian?","Steven B. Miller - Express Scripts Holding Co.","To keep a level playing field for their employees, a lot of plans are saying, why should we not have the co-pay card apply for drugs, but if you go to the hospital you don't get the same type of discount. So this is really to treat all employees fairly. So what we do is we accept these co-pay cards to help offset the costs, which actually lowers the total costs for the plan, therefore, everyone benefits from lower premiums, but the individual patient is still responsible for their share of the co-pay.","These things have gotten a lot more talk than they are actually in application, but we have the abilities to work with our clients. They're incredibly flexible in our platform, and so we can accommodate this as the client needs it.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Just one more follow-up. Any thoughts on Amazon, like they're a client of yours. When did they sign with you? How long does that contract run through? And have there been any more discussions around how maybe you could work with Amazon in the future? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I mean, I think it was kind of folks figured out middle last year that we had implemented Amazon; very pleased when they chose us. What I would say as it relates to sort of the contract length and everything else, the only thing I'd say is it's a normal commercial contract for us. We are performing well to that contract. And I would say I'm not going to talk about any of the conversations we've had other than to say as a client, they care a lot about their employees. They want service to be excellent. They are focused on every dollar that they're spending, just as all of our clients are. And we're having terrific conversations with them and implementing a number of our programs that are going to help their employees get drugs more safely, more cost effectively, and stay on them. And so they've been a great client in terms of adopting programs and working with us.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much. And then if Part B rolls into Part D, would that be an opportunity for you guys?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, we do think so, and that's one of the things we've been advocating as it relates to \u2013 in Washington D.C. is again, bringing the disciplined approach that we and our industry, frankly, as well as our company would bring to Part B, to Part D, and bringing that into the sort of management paradigm that we have would be very positive.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, I appreciate everyone dialing in. That's a good question to end on, because as you can see, we're excited about our business. We love a model where when we can drive trends down to zero, we actually get paid more for it, and we're aligned with our clients in terms of that. And we are focused on continuing to drive that model and look forward to sharing a lot more with you at our May 2 Analyst Day.

If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ben Bier, Vice President of Investor Relations.

The press release is posted on the investor relations section of our website at www.express-scripts.com.","At this point, I will turn the call over to George to review the agenda for this morning.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Today Eric will review our financial results and outlook. Tim will highlight our strong business performance and future prospects. Before Eric begins I'd liked to take a minute to talk about our relationship with Anthem. A week ago, we filed a response to Anthem's lawsuit. As I have said before I strongly prefer that we had never reach this point. However, we want to make clear that we are confident that we have negotiated in good faith; are fulfilling our contractual obligations; are providing excellent service to both Anthem and its members.","While it is unfortunate we are in this situation, we believe our legal case is strong. We value Anthem as a client and we very much would like to continue working with them for the long-term. We believe we are Anthem's best PBM option, delivering great care, keeping drug costs in check and helping to grow their business. We are currently collaborating with them to implement solutions and we are proud of the results we are helping Anthem to achieve. We look forward to spending today focusing on the results of our strong financial quarter and sharing our excitement about our future.","I will now turn it over to Eric.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. This morning I'm happy to report adjusted earnings per share of $1.22, representing growth of 11% over last year. In line with our expectations, we adjudicated approximately 324 million adjusted claims, up 5% year-over-year. We also generated EBITDA of approximately $1.5 billion. The anticipated lower EBITDA and profitability per adjusted claim relative to the first quarter of 2015 was a result of several things, including the expected transition of the Catamaran business at the end of 2015 and into 2016, of which the primary services provided were formulary management and manufacturer rebate services, with no associated claims.","The expected roll-off of the Coventry Medicare business on January 1, 2016, the annual impact attributable to our renewals of which January 1, 2016, was an above average year, and the associated ramp up cost for benefit design changes and 1\/1 implementations. And finally and in particular, the renewal of our second-largest client in May 2015, which initially results in lower margin per claim.","In addition, this quarter we issued senior notes consisting of $500 million 3.3% senior notes due 2021, and $1.5 billion 4.5% senior notes due 2026. The proceeds were used to repay debt and to enter into an accelerated share repurchase program, and for other general corporate purposes.","During the quarter we repurchased approximately 46 million shares for roughly $3.4 billion which includes the impacts of settling our 2015 ASR program in January of 2016, and the new 2016 ASR program in late February. We expect the settlement of the 2016 ASR program to occur in the third quarter.","Finally, I want to touch on a change made to amortization of the Anthem intangible assets. In 2009, based on the overall structure and complexity of the agreement and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, we assumed a 15-year amortization period for the intangible asset.","In light of Anthem's lawsuit and following accounting guidance, we changed the amortization to end with the current contract in 2019. The effect was to reduce the amortization period by five years. The triggering event for this change took place in March and increased the first quarter intangible asset amortization by $10.5 million. Future quarters will increase by approximately $32 million. This change has no impact on EBITDA, although this was a prudent decision under generally accepted accounting principle requirements, this change does not reflect our commitment to service Anthem's patients or our commitment to renew the contract at the end of the term. We believe we are the best partner to service Anthem's complex business and are well positioned to improve the competitiveness of their offering in the market.","Looking forward, we are pleased with our 2016 earnings guidance. We continue to expect 2016 adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, representing growth of 3% to 5% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA. While consistent with previous years, the increased profitability in the back half of 2016 is a result of our model of alignment, focus, scale and supply chain strategies expected to drive strong operating and financial results. More specifically, we anticipate mail growth and new generic launches will drive increased volumes as the year progresses. In addition, our digital and productivity initiatives are expected to drive lower fill costs and call volumes in the second half of the year.","We are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share from a range of $6.10 to $6.28, to a new range of $6.31 to $6.43, representing growth of 14% to 16% over 2015. This increase is attributed to our focus on generating cash flow from operations and managing our capital structure to maximize shareholder returns. We now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 635 million to 645 million.","With respect to the second quarter of 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.55 to $1.59, up 8% to 10% year over year. Consistent with recent years, we anticipate revenues related to a large client contract will be realized in the second quarter due to the structure of the contract.","In summary, we delivered overall financial performance in line with our expectation and expect to deliver solid results for the year. I will now turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Thanks, Eric. As Eric noted, our financial results are strong, and we have a great foundation upon which to build. Eric and I and our teams share a steadfast commitment to return on invested capital, rigorous financial discipline and focused expense management. This financial mindset fuels our business model of alignment and our commitment to client and patient care. We are well-positioned to maximize long-term client and shareholder value.","We continue to invest in creating dynamic solutions to help patients and clients. Leveraging our digital assets and engagement strategies, we comprehensively drive better, more cost effective health outcomes. These solutions include an expanding range of programs which combine our deep, specialized approach to patient care with our ability to creatively contract for best cost and care outcomes. As we enhance our core capabilities, we create even more reasons for clients to stay with us and for prospects to choose us.","As I look at the evolving healthcare landscape, it is clear that our powerful collection of assets protect our clients against tomorrow's healthcare challenges while we address today's acute client needs.","In that context we're very pleased in our performance thus far during the selling and renewal season. While it is still early, we anticipate another strong year, with a 2017 retention rate of 95% to 98%, excluding approximately 1% of Coventry scripts that are rolling off due to acquisition. You will recall last year our retention guidance at this point in 2015 was 94% to 97%. We clearly have positive momentum.","That momentum will be on display later this week as we welcome more than 1,000 attendees to our Outcomes Symposium for clients and prospects. They attend because we develop the industry's most effective solutions, deliver the best patient care and drive powerful advocacy to put medicine within reach of those who need it. We will share with our clients and prospects new solutions that build upon the industry-leading clinical programs we have collaborated with them to develop. Simply put, our clients are working with us to create the future of pharmacy.","Speaking of the future, I am excited to take on the role of CEO and lead our company forward. Energized by a singular mission to deliver great care for patients and always align with clients, Express Scripts will continue to change healthcare through relentless innovation and bold actions.","I'll now turn it over to George for his comments.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim. This is my last earnings call as Chairman and CEO, and I want to take a few moments to talk about what we have built at Express Scripts and why I am more excited than ever about the future of our company. The board unanimously agreed that Tim's deep industry expertise, financial discipline and passion for our clients, patients and employees, make him the ideal choice to succeed me as CEO. I am confident Tim and his leadership team will not only continue to deliver on our mission, but innovate to meet the needs of our patients and clients. I look forward to staying on as Chairman as we position Express Scripts for continued growth.","I also want to take a moment and thank all of you for believing in Express Scripts over the years and investing in us so that we can do the important work of controlling healthcare costs and improving patient outcomes. When you invest in Express Scripts, you're investing in the healthcare of 85 million people we service. We have been successful because we focus on doing one thing extremely well, caring for our patients. Our business model alignment achieves better patient health outcomes and helps clients control healthcare costs.","Our mission is to keep our clients ahead of constantly evolving marketplace trends. We accomplish this by continuously developing new, innovative solutions for our clients. This is as critical today as it was in 1998 when I joined Express Scripts. In 18 years we've had dozens of earnings calls, hundreds of investor conferences and thousands of meetings with you. I have always had one clear theme, an independent PBM, fully aligned with clients, can dramatically improve health outcomes. You can measure our success in many ways, but the most important measure is that we have helped millions of people live better lives.","Thank you for your support and guidance. And now we'll take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you very much, at this time we are ready to take questions. Our first question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks very much. George, we'll miss you on the conference calls going forward. Thanks, as always, for all your insights. So, let me first start, Tim, just in talking about two components around this year's selling season as well as next year's. So when we think about business that was brought on for 1\/1 of 2016, you talked about some incremental costs, you talked about mail and some other programs that will ramp throughout the year.","I'm just curious, as you look back, was there anything unusual about 2016 and the business that you brought on from a pricing perspective? And then as we think about 2017, can you maybe talk about one, the pricing environment? Two, I believe you have a retail relationship that's up for renewal. They recently signed with Optum. What are you seeing in the market around these types of maintenance choice offerings in the marketplace? And do you think that there's an incremental opportunity to work more closely with a company like Walgreens going forward?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Thanks for the questions, Lisa, and good morning. First of all, relating to pricing for the new business in January, I would say we obviously had a strong selling season in terms of winning new business, and as well as our retention as you know. And I would say there was not anything that would've been out of what I would call the ordinary in terms of the pricing environment. So from that standpoint, I would not read through the \u2013 what has been the sequencing of EBITDA that I've seen for most of my 18 years in this business, anything different as it relates to that in our first quarter results. It's competitive, there was a lot of business that we were able to bid on and win, and we feel good about that.","As it relates to the products, that are out there regarding the use of 90-day scripts. As you know, we do have actually two different Retail 90 products that we take to market; one of them with Walgreens. And I completely believe that as we drive a more consumer focused model, and as we drive even stronger member interface, that those programs will continue to, for certain clients, and those clients are some of them are ours, some of them aren't ours, to be something that they want. And we see a very strong opportunity to work with partners in retail, to ensure that we deliver not only the best cost outcomes, but look at really, what else can you do in managing the total member and what role can retail play in that.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And what do you see in that? I mean, do you think that you could do that in just a partnership relationship? Do you need deeper ties in some way to really truly manage that patient at retail? And then secondly, you saw a nice growth in mail in the quarter. Are you starting to see where customers are finally realizing the benefit of bringing people back into the mail order business?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Our mail numbers were so hard to read through as you know because of client losses over several of the last years. What I would say is when we looked at sort of clients we've kept, our mail volume has actually been good. So same store sales for us has actually not really mirrored what you've seen in the overall numbers. And what you're now seeing based on a better retention year, and our focus on improving experience, is that in fact there are a lot of clients that have always believed in mail, that continue to believe in mail, that are working with us to support mail, and increasingly we're seeing health plans move that direction. And so we've had several large health plans in the last six months with hundreds of thousands of lives in our Select Home Delivery Program. As again, we've got the experience to the point where the consumers are supportive of it, they're supportive of it, they like the cost and clinical outcomes that it has.","As it relates to the kind of relationship that we need to have, I think we have the kind of relationships with the supply chain more broadly, the retailers in particular that will enable us to continue to evolve a strategy that wins as it relates to Retail 90.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Just one last one, Tim. You talk about the 95% to 98% retention having good visibility around that. Can you maybe just talk about what you have up for renewal this year versus last year? I know you said last year was a tough renewal year, you have a lot of renewals. Can you just put that into some level of context for us? And then secondly, can you maybe just size what you think are some of the RFP opportunities in the market this year? Is it consistent with last year? Is it better than last year? How should we think about that?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","So what I'd say is for us, last year was an extraordinarily large year. We had a number of our health plans renewed which are large, and on whom we focus a great deal. We obviously had our second largest client renewed for the long-term. So last year was a bigger year than you would expect. This year I would call a more normal year, maybe even a slightly light year, but I would call it a normal year for us both in terms of mix of business as well as the size of the book that's out there. As it relates to sort of the way it spreads out, I would say it's pretty normal.","As it relates to the opportunities that are out there right now. I would say it's a bit better than last year, just a bit. We see a little bit more in a couple of spaces, opportunity than we would have seen last year. But it's early. And as you know, the year plays out pretty much for us over the next three to four months, and we will hopefully find ourselves on the good side. We've certainly had some early successes, we're very pleased with that and we've got some business we're already installing for one of 2017, one very significant health plan. But we've got a lot of work left to do.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. You mentioned supply chain savings as a possible driver of EBITDA in the back half of the year. I presume that's trying to extract more blood from the ABC supply relationship. Is there any way to change that relationship to help you pull more from them?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Robert, I wouldn't want to characterize the relationship with ABC as anything other than one that we continue to work with them, they've been a very good partner for us, and we've got very high standards for anyone who works with us in terms of what they deliver in terms of value. ABC had been delivering that value, and I have no reason to believe they won't continue to. And will work closely with them to make sure that happens.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Maybe a separate \u2013 your visibility on the earnings as a PBM is better than most. What are the significant barriers or variables rather between now and year-end that might prevent you from tightening that EBITDA range?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll ask actually Eric to take that. Obviously it's something we focus on a great deal. While the sequencing of EBITDA is exactly in line with our expectations and we're right on our plans, obviously helping you understand sort of what's going to happen and how that range is going to be narrowed is something that we decide on. And I'll let Eric take that.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, Bob, so I talked about this in my script. Certainly there new drug launches coming out, expected to come out, and as we sit here today and estimate those volumes, if those don't materialize, that's one of the headwinds in the back half of the year. I think everything else for the most part, we have line of sight and visibility into. Obviously utilization has to continue to stay on the same path. No reason to expect that that won't. But those are really the bigger drivers of that.","And then as I talked about in my script, we also have very a significant cost reductions planned around productivity in our digital initiatives. Our digital initiatives are one of the things that's been driving our improvement in our mail volumes. And we think that'll continue, and we'll continue to enhance those digital initiatives to make for a better patient experience. But those are kind of the things that are the bigger drivers of the year.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is open.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. First maybe just a clarification on that last answer. Eric, when you spoke about new drug launches, are you talking about generic launches? Or any new products and formulary decisions that could impact profitability materially?","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Generic launches, particularly Crestor that comes out here in a month or so.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Sure. And maybe a little more macro, we saw the IMS medicine use Report last week highlighted a large delta between gross and net. I think that tells us Pharma is taking increases and that PBMs are offsetting them. But I'd love to get your thoughts on the sustainability of that, gross to net? And what it tells us about how well you're working? And maybe what it tells us about the economics of your business?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll take that and that's a good question. It was what I heard at JPMorgan. It was the most frequently asked question is this notion. And the reason I think it is, is because it has gotten wide. And it's very clear, those who are willing to take bold actions, those who are caring for patients in a way that enable things to be done, that drive better outcomes even though those things may look challenging, witness what we did in hepatitis C, are going to enjoy the better results as it relates to that gross-to-net spread. They're going to be at the bottom of that cost curve, which is where we have put our clients and how we've worked with them.","And I've got to tell you, it's still early. So, I'm not going to prognosticate as it relates to Pharma inflation for the full year. I don't expected it to be low, let's put it that way. And I believe that the players that are going to create maximum value for patients and for payers, as far out as we look, and this has been true even without the super high inflation we've seen in the last couple of years, has been those that can dramatically affect outcomes that are better for patients.","I think the other piece I would say is it's twofold. It's not just the management of formulary. It is also the management of individual patient choice as we see these new products come out. And so from that standpoint again, the real leverage isn't just gross to net on rebates, it's gross to net on patient cost compared to what the idea would be. And we hold ourselves to a very high standard on both of those. And we see that as a significant differentiator and a significant opportunity for the next three to five years.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Would your view be then when gross to net is expanding or high, that it enables your economics? Or do you think it's \u2013 or do you think you hold those economics no matter the environment?",": It does enable those economics because we work with clients to ensure that the formularies that are place are things they believe in. It particularly helps our economics with those clients who work with us to put these programs in place, because we \u2013 in some cases we take risk on our ability to go out and contract these things. In other cases we work with clients, and they let us share some of the upside, because they want us aligned as it relates to how we create value and take care of patients. And so that's the dynamic that we see.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the questions. Actually just a couple on pricing. We've seen some declines in the revenue per script over the past few quarters, understanding there's some moving pieces here with things like generic conversions. But I'm curious if you guys could comment on what you're seeing from branded manufacturers in the first few months of this year. Have the price increases from your vantage point been in line with historical averages? Below? Just any kind of context you can provide around that would be helpful.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, this is Eric. For the most part, the increases have been in line coming into the first of the year. We're seeing a little change in manufacturers and the timing of some of the increases, but everything we see and expect for the rest of the year should be in line with previous years.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Might be the same answer but I guess more specifically around specialty. One of your large specialty pharmacy competitors commented recently that price increases they noticed had slowed across the board more than they had expected to date. And just curious if you've seen any changes specifically in the specialty manufacturers' behavior around taking price in the current environment?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we have seen an ever so slight down on the specialty side of the business early in the year. But expect again as the year moderates with what we see now, that to subside.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You've also got to remember that revenue on a per claim basis isn't just an output of inflation and filling \u2013 it really is impacted by formulary design and what we do. So if certain drugs have a very high cost and increase ratios, our supply chain people working with our formulary management team and our clients go out and try to change the formulary to select better products. Same thing going from retail to mail, if you have to convert three retail scripts to mail script, by definition my revenues come down. When I can convert a branded script to a generic script, by definition my revenues come down. When I convert somebody from a very high cost specialty drug to a lower cost more efficacious specialty drug, my revenues come down.","The beauty of all that is, is that's our model of alignment, and so our patient costs go down, our client costs go down and our shareholder value goes up, and that's what we're all about.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's helpful and I guess just, George, on that topic, as we think about new drugs coming to market, when you look at the pipeline for this year, can you maybe help us contextualize the opportunity relative to past years? As we think about hep C and the work you guys did there, PCSK9s and the programs you have in place there. Any major categories? I mean there's been so many you guys have talked about. But any major categories or products that you guys would want to call out as being in focus from this year's pipeline?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just to reiterate on your point. That's what you've seen in the hepatitis space as we've tried to bring prices down for our patients so that as we've said over the years, that access is just as an important component of healthcare outcomes as anything else. So if you can't afford to get to the drug it doesn't do you any good to have a drug.","So it's really important to focus on making sure access is there. PCSK9s, as you know we've been very diligent in making sure that where appropriate when needed, the patient gets it, and where not, they don't. And making sure that we still prefer the statins and where it's appropriate and do what we need to do. As far as the future I'll let Tim talk to that.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Yeah, what I would see a couple of things to be specific. Obviously in hep C we've had a new product come in that's significant, and we've got another one that we believe is coming. So as we look at the formulary for 2017, we have some interesting dynamics that we're working through. PCSK9s not a lot new this year, but we know that we are preparing for the possible next steps as it relates to broader indications there.","Shorter-term, in the inflammatory case, we're watching and working very closely in that area and actually going to be talking with our clients about some ideas as it relates to that, because that's the space that's got quite a bit going on right now.","And then there's someone off stuff that you just have to constantly keep your eyes on. A product that comes out that has a terrific outcome for a set of patients, something like dermatitis, needs to be managed appropriately, not just priced appropriately. We think we can get the manufacturers to price things in a really rational way, but that doesn't mean that we can't, we shouldn't, work with the physicians and so forth to make sure that it's prescribed appropriately. And so we've got a lot of work to do as we look at the pipeline moving forward. And that's not even to speak about over the next 18 months, the possibility of bioequivalence and how we may be able to play a role there.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for all the comments.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is open.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning. And George, echoing an earlier comment, thank you for all your time and patience in dealing with us. Hope to hear from you even if it's at less frequent intervals.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Tim, your first-time client retention rate guidance of 95% to 98% is now back at more normal levels, which confirms what we've been hearing as well. But could you maybe speak to the quality of the new client opportunities for this year? Because the past say 12 to 18 months or so has had a fair share of unique circumstances that besides your own included competitor being acquired, upcoming managed care consolidation opportunities, so wondering if maybe this is \u2013 this year even if the dollar amounts are there, if there are unique characteristics trickling into the selling cycle this year as well? So maybe high retention rates or any other trends that you're seeing?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","I wouldn't say, \u2013 thanks for the question, Garen. I would not say that I see anything dramatically different as it relates to sort of the mix of what's out in the market for a possible bid right now. I think it tracks pretty well with what we've seen in prior years. As I said, maybe a little bit bigger. As in every year there are always a couple of sort of unusual ones that are out there, unusual for different reasons, and this is no different than that.","So I would not tell you that there's any read-through to some dramatic shift in the quality of opportunities. Obviously, we've got a lot of work to do to try to bring some of those in house here. We take each one of them individually. We love it when we can start with their data and understand their unique challenges. I mean for example I saw a prospect deck yesterday where we looked at their 8,000 diabetes patients, and 4,000 of those patients were not an ACB or ARB, despite being at the age where they should be. Look, those are the kind of conversations we want have with prospects. And so we start with their data and we find ways to create value based on their unique strategies and circumstances. And that's no different this year than any other year.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. So I guess the clients, where their contracts are up for renewal, they put an RFP out, they're just as willing to switch PBMs, given the recent news events of various sorts, similar to prior years?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","I think that's right. I think that \u2013 you know what? The bottom line is that the PBM is servicing the client really well and driving down their costs and sharing that with the clients in ways the clients are completely aligned with, it's a pretty sticky business still, and we don't see any results of any kind of the new stuff you've seen at all as it relates to that. It's not that we don't have conversations. It's not that we don't explain ourselves. It's not that we don't appoint folks to things that they can read and draw their own conclusions, but as we've done that, what I can tell you is the conversation very quickly turns back to what are we doing to drive down costs? What are we doing to drive up patient access? How have we performed in the past year? How is our service for patients, which is very strong? What's our digital member engagement strategy? The conversation moves back to that, because that's where these plans really need to focus, and the other stuff is noise.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And then my follow-up is more of a clarification question. On Coventry, when it was with Medco, I thought the two contracts awarded were more evenly split, but the 1% headwind versus this year's near 3% obviously suggests otherwise. So I guess probably for Tim, could you elaborate on that a little bit? Was it always more of a 75% to 25% split? Or if it wasn't, could you just maybe shed more light on how the contracts evolved to reconcile to the present?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Just to be clarified and get into the facts, the Coventry contract was a component of Medco business. When we bought Medco Express Scripts inherited that contract, and when they got bought there was a process by which they roll off of our book of business. And what you're seeing is the Medicare business is now rolling off, and that's what you're seeing in those numbers. So that's the whole story.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","The only other thing you would see is that over the time period they've had various lines of business grow and shrink. And that's what you would probably see in the numbers based on what you would've assumed from say five years ago.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. That helps. Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Your line is open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. A question about formulary management and rebates. What is the percent of your client book at this point that's following your exclusionary formulary recommendations?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think we said somewhere around 27 million, 28 million lives are in that, and I would tell you that's pretty close, it's probably if anything gone up a couple of million. I don't have the exact number at hand, but we've had literally almost zero folks go the other way and step out of it, and we continue to have plans come into it. We increasingly also are seeing health plans looking to potentially clone it.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Got it. Thank you. And then, Tim, in the release you mentioned data insights as one of the key things that makes Express unique. Can you just talk a little bit about what those data insights are and how you're using them to compete for incremental business at this point?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure. I gave you one little bit of an example just now when I talked about our prospect deck, and that was one of half-a-dozen things we showed that prospect using their own data. But we've invested quietly but significantly in the ability to manage large amounts of data in very complex ways. And so when you look at fraud, waste and abuse, and what we've been able to do, not only \u2013 compounds was not a one and done. If you take a look, that is a daily battle for us to stay ahead of a marketplace that's constantly \"innovating\" as it relates to ways to take our clients' money without creating value. And so we use great amounts of that data to not only in our own book run fraud, waste and abuse, but increasingly, for our health plan clients to help power their programs, power their provider networks, power their payment mechanisms by virtue of being able to have a very complete look at prescribing patterns, at patient outcomes and so forth.","Another example around that is opioids. And so we actually as part of our product suite is in fact a predictive model as it relates to patients who potentially could become addicted to opioids based on a whole series of factors we're able to take from the data that we would have around those individuals, their prescribers, their conditions and so forth. And again, that's a very significant piece. I've heard Steve Miller say and Glen Stettin say, that the epidemic that occurred in Indiana, we would've actually picked it up as it relates to the AIDS coming back because of used needles. We would've picked that up much more quickly in our data than actually the actual experience picked up.","So you take that, and then if you overlay that with the ability to manage patients and predict their outcomes at the individual level around adherence. Again, we've become very, very good at predicting and intervening ahead of when a patient becomes non-adherent based on factors that we're aware of. And so all of that is \u2013 it's certain examples of how we're able to use this.","I think the last piece is, as we look forward, things like prior authorizations and how we can work with physicians to make those more streamlined, make them more intuitive. If we have something in the patient's history, even if they weren't our patient at the time, that we're able to get and understand, those are things that we're able to do as well.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from the line Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to just go back to some early comments; you talked about engaging members more and you used the phrase digital initiatives a number of times. Can you elaborate on what those initiatives are? And how that will be incorporated into a plan or plans that benefit design? Is it like a separate app that someone has to download and use separately? Or is it integrated into whatever plan that they're currently under?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","So the answer is a little bit of both. We have to start with the client's benefit design and the patient's \u2013 therefore what they have access to. But where we've been investing, and continue to invest, is \u2013 you may have heard me say this in the past. Back a couple of years ago, or I guess it was a year and a half ago, when we began the search for someone to really drive our mail franchise forward, we ultimately concluded that it wasn't about driving mail franchise, it was about driving member experience in an environment that's increasingly omni-channel.","And once you define that as your challenge, and you define the clinical advantages of mail for the patients for whom that's right, and you look at the Acute Care that you can deliver through a strong retail network, and you look at the other things you can do to deliver star ratings to health plans and other things, that then informs a strategy that cuts across our entire organization. And so while it manifests itself, yes, in our digital app, which if you follow it, has evolved several iterations in the last year, and is now a four plus star app on the App Store \u2013 it was two when we started.","In terms of how the website presents opportunities for patients which has doubled our daily retail to mail conversions, and continues to for those patients where that's a benefit and where the plans save money. But it also then moves all the way across the platform to our patient care advocates who have better tools, more intuitive information put right in front of them by virtue of those same algorithms that are driving our digital strategy for the member-facing piece.","And so end-to-end, when you look at what we're doing on member engagement, it really fuels the first \u2013 I think the first inning still of a game where we can believe we can be transformative in helping members or their caregivers make the best decisions.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay, that's helpful. If I could just switch gears for a second, I know George, that you had made some comments around Anthem at the beginning. My question is really more about what's the process from here? Obviously, they filed a claim. You had a response. What's the timing of \u2013 does Anthem have another chance to respond? Who's taking a look at this then to make a decision whether \u2013 I mean is it a decision to make whether our case goes forward? If you could elaborate maybe on process for us and then timing? That will be helpful. Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, unfortunately the situation has evolved into a lawsuit. And like I said in my prepared comments, that's really \u2013 we did not want to see it get here. We believe we've lived up to our contractual obligations. We offer the best levels of service to the patients, and we do everything we can to help drive their economics in the right direction. At the end of the day, a lawsuit was filed; we countered, and now it's in that process. So this is probably going to be quite a long, drawn out situation.","The reality is, at any point we're always open to conversations. If they want to come in and have a conversation that's reasonable in nature, nothing to do with $3 billion \u2013 that's pretty ludicrous; you've heard me say that before. We're open to that. Going forward, obviously this isn't just \u2013 this really has the totally undivided attention of our entire board. I will continue on as Chairman of the Board. And so all of us on the board will continue to be involved. This will really be up to Tim and his team to position the company well. The pledge is to continue to service the members, to continue to service the client with information and the data they need to do their job. We'll continue to bring them cost-saving opportunities to them, and as they look forward to the future, hopefully they'll continue to implement those ideas. And we'll try to come to a resolution. But at the end of the day, we're in a legal process now.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. If I could just follow up lastly for Tim? Your retention rate guidance obviously implies you're not really seeing any type of impact from the overhang really of the Anthem. Does it come up in discussion at all?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure it does. I wouldn't say it comes up in the majority of the cases. It probably comes up in what I'll call is a small to medium minority of the cases. And we have taken great pains to make sure that our account teams understand why we're here. Because our core is around aligning around clients and patients, and so this is the sort of the thing that really, as you can imagine is a leader helping our folks understand that we're going to service the heck out of Anthem. We have nothing but intention to continue to do a great job for them, to position ourselves well to be a choice that they want to make at some period of time in the future when we get this behind us.","And so what we've done is made it very, very clear to our team how to keep this isolated, how to focus on the things that actually our clients need us to focus on. And the bottom line is, while it has been I'd say a minority of conversations, it's been a very short conversation, and folks pretty quickly move on.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But Charles there's also a difference. When you're dealing with the \u2013 our account teams are dealing with the pharmacy management teams and our clients, this may come up. It's really one of the questions in trying to understand that gets press. There's a lot written about it and what have you. So there's always going to be conversation. I don't think it's really a distraction though, because it's what we deliver, it's what we do.","But if you go to the other side of that, I've been CEO here for quite some time, CFO before that. I've been in this business for a long time. I was in other businesses before this one. What you don't typically see is public hearing of a situation. And I think that's what really strikes most CEOs. I still have a lot of conversations with CEOs. Tim has taken over those relationships, he's building on them. Tim and I have been out to a lot of clients over the last several months. And when you do that, obviously when you're sitting with another CEO that often has disputes with their partners and vendors, it never gets to this level. And so I think there's an inquisitive mind at the other end of the table that says what's going on?","And unfortunately for us, we scratch our heads with that, because we would have liked to have all of this done in the back room and figured out how to solve these things and how to go forward on a mutually agreeable basis. But unfortunately it didn't come out that way. So at the CEO level, those conversations do take place, but not from a hurt the business, or it puts us at risk, or it hurts our ability to sell. But instead it's really just a little bit of head scratching going on in the conversation.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good morning, guys. I appreciate you taking the question. I think most of the topics that I wanted to touch on have been hit, but George or Tim, I wanted to talk a little bit about M&A, where we've seen over the last six months or so, a bunch of interesting assets trade in the specialty space, some of them focused on medical or oncology where I thought that you guys might have been more aggressive. You've chosen to more aggressively buy back stock. I guess could you walk us through the rationale on M&A? And maybe why not be more aggressive as some of these assets come to market?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure. Thanks for the question. I'll take it. So, let me be really clear, we \u2013 and we've said this I know, are very actively and we'll continue to be very active in looking at all the sorts of things. As you can appreciate given our size and where we sit in the market place, we have an awful lot of stuff that we get to take a look at. But let me be clear, anything that we think can help our clients, or help our patients, can drive better outcomes, can expand or extend our model, or otherwise be complimentary; we're interested in if it adds shareholders value, if it makes sense from both a financial standpoint and a strategic standpoint.","It also has to compete against what could we do without the asset? And so when we've looked at any number of things, I'm not going to go into any specific examples, I'm familiar with obviously some of what has traded and some of what will, and I understand why those who bought it bought it. But let me be clear, we will be aggressive where we can draw a line to those three things shareholder value, helping our clients and helping our patients. We will not be aggressive where it doesn't make sense, where we see other ways to achieve a similar result using our capital more efficiently.","So the last thing I'd say is I wouldn't want you to think it's either or. I would not want you to think that because we are buying stock back we therefore were not strongly and deeply looking at any number of opportunities that are in the marketplace. We are big enough and hopefully disciplined enough, I believe disciplined enough, we certainly have had a history of it and I intend to carry that forward, to be able to do both of those things really, really well.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then I appreciate that commentary. And then maybe one more follow-up kind of on the selling season. On the 95% to 98% retention, I guess can we talk about what is driving the churn, and who might be leaving it? Is it a mix of people who may want to be more price sensitive, or is there any of the legacy foundation 14 dissatisfaction that's driving churn? I guess just when people are leaving ESI, why are they leaving?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure, I mean it's always, as you can imagine, you'd love to at one level think everybody loves you and would never leave you. The flip side is if we price to keep 100% of everything, we've always said we don't 100% retention, because there're sometimes you're just not going to get it exactly right and somebody is going to come in and be a little bit more aggressive than us, and that level of sensitivity at the client level will be something that causes them to move.","What I'd say is, our book of business \u2013 and I looked at this over about five, six years ago, Express Scripts book of business in particular has a nice middle-market element to it. There's a more natural churn there with brokers and so forth, and so some of that \u2013 when you look at the churn, it's not anyone reason. You've got a couple of different market segments.","Typically the other thing that happens is if we drop the ball on service, it goes into play. And now we really have to chase our tail. And thankfully we're strong on service right now. We saw two or three years ago where it looks like when in fact we were trying to catch up on service. And so what I'd tell you is there's no one thing that drives it. 95% to 98% is something we feel good about. We target the high end of that range, as you can appreciate. I've told people I won't be very satisfied at the low end of that range. And that suggests to me that there's a pretty minor amount of churn in the grand scheme of things.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks, guys. And, George, well wishes.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah, hi. Good morning. And, George, enjoyed working with you over the years and my best wishes for your next phase. I have a few follow-up questions here. First of all, if we can start with the productivity enhancements that you talked about, as a driver of EBITDA in the second half. So can you maybe walk us through the opportunity areas where you can save cost, and maybe quantify the cost savings goals, and over what time period?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. So, Ricky, this is Eric. More specifically, we're very focused on our fulfillment process, constantly looking at ways to improve that and bring costs down in that process, and no different than past years. We have some initiatives we're putting in place to improve and reduce those costs that are more oriented to the second half of this year.","The other thing, we're looking at call volumes and with our digital transformation, we're seeing reductions in those call volumes and so we're going to continue to invest in that, and as a result, bring down the costs we incur around call volumes. Again, a lot of those initiatives are in process and will have an impact now, but a much greater impact as we significantly take those down in the last half of the year.","And then no different than we've had, SG&A reduction initiatives going on throughout our business. It's something we focused on in past years. I've been heavily focused on it since I got here. So every day, we're looking at how we are more efficient across this whole business. Those just happened to be two of the bigger initiatives that are going to drive the second half.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And can you help maybe quantify those savings?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","No, we're not going to get into that specific detail.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then my next question is for Tim. One of the questions you alluded to kind of at the (52:07), and obviously the pricing structure is different from what we've seen in the past and from competitors, around really the dynamics of list price versus size of rebate. So do you think that this is like just one specific drug or example, do you think this is something that could potentially be an indicator of potential changes, coming to how drug manufacturers are thinking of pricing drugs and negotiating rebates?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","It's so hard to pick one example and extrapolate from it, Ricky, as you can appreciate. Because the dynamics in a therapeutic class, the number of additional manufacturers already there, the number of things in the pipeline in front of it, the inflation over the last two years in that class. All these things kind of come to bear as the manufacturers make their decision. What I would say is, we've been very pleased to see a increasing number of manufacturers looking to be what I would call creative and responsible on pricing and you've heard several of them say that the missing piece for them has been what we can bring to the table which is the capture of data, and the use of data in such a way as to help them be confident that the way that their pricing the product is actually finding its way into the hands of patients and into the support of clients.","And so we've been encouraged by it. I don't know that any one drug is a harbinger of things to come. I think it's a harbinger though at a macro level that we have changed the dialogue with Pharma over the last two to three years, and we will continue to work very hard to create access for their products at fair prices for the patients who should be on them. And the Pharma companies that want to work with us on that basis are coming to the table and making great choices, and we hope that continues.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, lastly, on the selling season. I know there's been a lot of talk on this call about kind of like retention rates. I think that last couple of years you're talking about really putting a lot of focus on existing book and retention. When you think about this selling season, how do you think about (54:23) emphasis on retention or are you also kind of like aggressively in the marking, looking at opportunities to bring in new business?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure. All I'd say at this point is, there is nothing more important to us than retention in any year, and that includes this year. Obviously we'd love to win new cases, we love the fact that we've got a large number of prospects this week joining us in Orlando. But I will tell you that at the end of the day, we hold ourselves to a high standard, we've got a lot of work to this year but it starts with retention, Ricky.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning, guys. A question for George and Tim. Every now and then, we still get asked questions by investors. As Pharma sees some pricing pressure, and they bring down prices, how did that impact Express in this environment today? And to those people who asked the question of why do we still need an independent PBM, how would you address those two questions?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll start, and then Tim can certainly chime in. Having a lot of years of experience, first of all Pharma typically raised prices, and so the question is how much worse would that be if you didn't have an independent PBM? And I think that actually our mission is not to be constrained by any other ideas except it's in the best interest of our patients our clients to control costs while improving health outcomes. And without the tools we bring to the market, I'm not, in my opinion, you'd see much higher costs, much higher run rates. And it goes back to the conversation we had earlier about net and gross. And the reason those spreads continue to open and widen is because of the tools we put in place to help our clients control costs. Tim?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","I completely agree. I mean, the thing I love about this business and why I'm so excited about it when I got forward is one, we've got really robust competitors. It forces us to say innovative and smart, and in our case I believe that our differentiating story resonates strongly. It lets us focus 100% of our resources on solving the challenges that patients and clients face today. And I cannot imagine a better place to be.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","And then just a follow-up for Eric. As we think about the revenue per claim and the Catamaran business rolling off, how should we think about those statistics, revenue per claim and then from a margin perspective, if you pull out the Catamaran impact? Are you seeing same-store margin expansion?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, we're not going to quantify. We quantified at the beginning of the year the impacts overall from the loss of Catamaran and Coventry, but I don't want to get into any further specific impacts around Catamaran. We typically don't talk about client specifics. We only did in this instance because that was such a large impact from those two, which were a result of acquisitions, not a result of losing a client per se. But beyond that, we just don't want to get into any further specifics around that.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When you look at the data, you've got to always remember that every year if you take out our two biggest clients, roughly, just speaking in generalities, roughly a third of the business comes due every year. A third of that book re-prices every year. So what you're facing is the challenge of that.","When you look at this year in particular we had our second-largest client re-price in May. We've said than in our prepared comments. So when you're lapping the year, you're facing the impact of your second-largest client having re-priced, plus you're looking at the impact of the normal trends that occur, and you build up a lot of costs. Think about all the plan designs. Which plans don't change, co-pays don't change, formulary management don't change. Every plan we have has numerous changes, plus the impact of Medicare changes that come in, Medicaid changes that occur. You've got millions of changes that come in \u2013 that all get initiated on January 1.","Our call-center people have to be prepared for that. Our account management teams have to work with our clients on it. The ramp up in cost attributable January 1 is always a big factor for us. So the first quarter run rate is a lot higher in both PPC and SG&A. And through the course of the year we get those monies back as we \u2013 things become normalized again. That's a cycle that we visit every year. And if you look at our trends over the last years, you'll see that profitability ramps up in the back half of the year, and that's not going to change.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate that. Thanks, George.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Larsen of Leerink Swann. Your line is open.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","So, George, congratulations on building a great business over the past 18 years. You've obviously done a lot for the Company, clients, as well as investors. So the one question I had was, for the 2Q payment that you mentioned in the press report, did you disclose if that's from Anthem or not? And is that potentially at risk given the litigation?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've never disclosed that and we feel comfortable that that should still run its course. There is always a little bit of an issue. We hedge a little, because it could fall back to the third quarter. And so that's the only softness, is if it doesn't occur in the second quarter, it would occur in the third quarter. But historically it's happened in the second quarter and we don't get into specifics around it. I appreciate your comments as well. Thank you very much.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Of course. Well deserved obviously. And then just one more. In the public documents regarding your relationship with Anthem, why haven't they accepted any of your proposals? It sounds \u2013 our checks indicate that Express is pretty fair when negotiating with clients, and are typically pretty responsive to client's needs, and it sounds like you've put forth some pretty good proposals to Anthem. Just any general sense as to why those haven't been accepted?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd say that's the magic question of the day, isn't it? We believe \u2013 there was a lot of conversation for some period, and you've heard them all, about $500 million and $700 million. And we feel like we need them to grow as well and be competitive, and we stepped up and met that. Now, we also know there was a lot they were leaving on the table just purely by plan design and opportunities. We also believe that it wasn't \u2013 that if we do it right, if we could in fact better help them manage their formularies and their networks and plan designs and going to market, helping them grow their business, our economies of scale grow as their economies of scale grow, and we're willing to share that.","And so it wasn't just the money we were putting on the table, some of which we're hopeful we get back with scale and size. But in addition, it's really aligning their products with the marketplace and that could have been worth billions of dollars. So when you put those two together, we think we've been more than fair in offering a very good offering. And again, we'll see how this all plays out, but it is a head scratcher.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Why don't we just take one more? I believe it's the last question in the queue.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Evan Stover of Robert Baird. Your line is open.","Evan A. Stover - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. A lot of other topics have been addressed, so I thought I'd take the opportunity to hit on a business that I don't hear you guys discuss very often, the Other segment. I ask because there was 30% revenue growth there this quarter, obviously very impressive. I'm wondering specifically if that's a couple of key launches going through CuraScript Specialty Distribution or if it is another item. And the second part of that question would be, as it relates to CuraScript, obviously there's new Part B pilot programs out there. I was wondering what Express Scripts' stance is on the potential for those to lower costs? And maybe more discretely, what type of impact that might have on that business, as we look out later this year and into 2017?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Well, thanks for calling it out. We obviously, and it's another explanation as it relates to how our EBITDA sequentially grows because these core set of businesses which aren't huge, but they are mighty in terms of \u2013 and they don't create any scripts for all practical purposes \u2013 have continued to grow at very, very nice rates and solve problems for other sorts of clients that they serve. We've had some new client growth, we've had some new products come to market, and so all of those fuel both our \u2013 especially distribution business as well as our UBC business as it relates to that.","I would also call out our Canadian business is really doing a great job and continues to grow clients as well, and has moved into new product lines, including Specialty. And so when you take a look at that collection of businesses, again, with the exception of Canada that doesn't produce scripts, we like a lot. That becomes an area of us to focus to potentially do M&A as well as just organically right now. The leadership of those businesses are doing a terrific job addressing their client's challenges.","As it relates to part B, I think it's a little bit early to call. And so really don't have a lot of great depth of commentary for you there other than to say obviously for us, we see a lot of opportunity on the medical side generally across a number of ways to get at that spend and manage it, as well as supplying some of the folks that are actually delivering care. And so \u2013 and it's something we're deeply looking at and thinking through, but in the short term our assets are really, really good.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I want to take this time to thank all of you for joining us on this call today. We appreciate your investment in Express Scripts. I think we are better positioned than ever. The marketplace, as it continues to evolve, our challenges are mighty and our solutions are great and I think we've got a great leadership team to take us to that whole next level of performance and meeting your needs as investors. So thank you very much, and look forward to talking to you at a future date. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","Thank you. And this does conclude today's conference.

[Operator Instructions] And as a reminder, today's conference is being recorded.","I'd now like to turn the conference over to Vice President of Investor Relations, David Myers. Please go ahead, sir.","David Myers","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our second quarter conference call. With me today are George Paz, our Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Hall, our CFO.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements, may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our filing with the SEC. For clarity purposes, all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables in our press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we will be discussing. The reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our earnings release, which is posted on our website.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who'll discuss our second quarter financial results.","Jeffrey L. Hall","Thanks, David. Well, obviously, we've had a few busy months here, including closing the Medco acquisition, executing our integration plan, migrating the first year of WAG, focusing on the selling season and signing a new contract with Walgreens. In addition, we're also reporting strong second quarter earnings and increasing guidance for the year. Adjusted claims for the quarter were 404.3 million, up 118% from last year. Our generic fill rate was 77.8%, up from 74% a year ago. In keeping with our model of alignment, as our clinical programs delivered savings to our clients, we also improved our gross profit. SG&A was up $80 million versus Q1 pro forma for the acquisition, as a result of an increase in management incentive compensation to reflect the increase in our expectations for the year and the reclassification of several Medco expenses from cost of goods sold to SG&A to conform with Express Scripts accounting methodology.","EBITDA for the quarter was $1.5 billion, and EBITDA per RX was up 14% versus prior year, again pro forma for the acquisition. Interest expense in the quarter was $169.5 million, as a result of the repayment of $1.5 billion of bonds at an average rate of 5.9% and continued low floating rates. Interest expense for 2012 is expected to be approximately $530 million. This quarter's effective tax rate, excluding non-recurring items related to purchase accounting, was 42.1%. The higher rate for the quarter was the result of several factors related to the closing of the transaction and a necessary year-to-date true-up.","We still expect our effective tax rate to be 39%, which means the tax rate for the second half is expected to be approximately 38%. EPS for the second quarter was $0.88, a 24% increase over last year. Cash from operations was $726 million, a 58% increase from last year. Including Medco's first quarter performance, year-to-date cash from operations is approximately $2 billion.","As a result of strong performance in the first half of the year and the accelerated realization of synergies, we are increasing our guidance range for 2012. We now expect EPS for the year, excluding transaction, integration and amortization expenses, to be in a range of $3.60 to $3.75, representing growth of 24% over 2011 at the midpoint. As we have said before, this range assumes that shares outstanding for the year will be 750 million and the tax rate will be 39%. If the share count or tax rate changes from these assumptions, our EPS forecast could change.","We are in the process of reviewing the strategic alternatives for several of our adjacent businesses, which are not core to our PBM offering. We do not expect the ultimate disposition of these businesses to have a material impact on our financial results. In summary, integration is proceeding well, and we continue to expect to complete the integration and achieve $1 billion of net synergies in 2014.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to George.","George Paz","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. Four months post closing, we are more confident that the combination with Medco provides significant opportunities to innovate, drive out waste and improve how health care is delivered. As part of our integration, we are combining Medco's clinical approach through its therapeutic resource centers and the use of specialized pharmacists with Consumerology, the application of behavioral sciences to health care. By blending the combined clinical skills with the behavioral sciences, we will be able to accelerate clinical offerings from our greater efficiencies in the health care system and better protect American families from the rising cost of prescription medications. Our shared vision is to increase therapy adherence where appropriate, lower costs and drive a better health outcome. Our previous acquisitions have succeeded through a disciplined approach to integration, including clinical programs, rationalization of our footprint and system migration. We believe operating on one platform is imperative in offering best-in-class service and meeting the market challenges and opportunities presented by Health Care Reform, Medicare and Medicaid expansion.","Just last week, we successfully moved our first-tier business to our destination operating platform. Our track record of successful integrations has allowed us to spend much more time this selling season discussing our innovative clinical offerings and cost-savings opportunities, including narrow network. As such, we are enjoying a successful selling season. Retention rates for both Express Scripts and Medco's legacy book of business exceed 95%, which is consistent with historical norms. We have won over 125 clients to date, which is consistent with prior years. None of our wins or renewals for the year require specific pharmacies to be included in our retail network. And we have begun a successful selling season in presenting narrow networks and believe this offering will continue to gain traction. We recently entered into a multi-year pharmacy network agreement with Walgreens to participate in our broadest retail pharmacy network. We will continue to design benefit programs that meet our clients' needs, including narrow networks, primary management and other clinical tools.","Our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for the year reflects the strength of our value proposition, confidence in our ability to successfully integrate our business and our unprecedented opportunity to make the use of medicine safer and more affordable, which is exactly what our plan sponsors need now.","At this point, I'd be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","I have 2 questions. The first is just on the synergy side. You mentioned in the release an acceleration of the capture there. Can you talk about maybe some of the specific areas, where you're seeing progress at this point earlier than may be anticipated?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Yes. We don't like to go into lots of detail, obviously. But certainly, the primary area, where we're seeing synergy coming faster than we had previously thought, is in the SG&A line. And we'll see that move through the balance of the year. I would say in the second quarter, not meaningful amount of synergy were realized, and we expect to -- that we'll realize some of those SG&A gains through the rest of the year.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then George, in your remarks there, you're just talking a little bit about narrow networks or preferred networks from a benefit design standpoint. Can you maybe go into a little bit more color on what you're seeing? And there's been a lot of talk about any of your customers considering it. To what extent are you actually seeing customers would decide to implement as you're working toward your 2013 benefit design?","George Paz","I think we ought to just keep in mind that there is no one-size-fits-all in anything we do. We have a very broad array of products and solutions for our customers, so it really depends on what a customer is looking for in their, quite frankly, their economic conditions in which they find themselves. To the extent that a client needs significant savings on a relatively quick basis, we have everything from mandatory mail programs, mandatory generic programs, very, very limited networks that compete the pharmacy against each other in order to become the preferred pharmacy and drive down cost for those members, to a very open offering for those clients that are -- that have a different viewpoint with respect to the pharmacy offering, which you should also keep in mind that we had a very successful retention season similar to historical levels. And basically, when we went out and had to resign these clients, none of them was offered Walgreens as an alternative, and yet we were still maintaining 95% of our book of business. So when you think about narrow networks, clearly without Walgreens in initially, that was our modus operandi at that point. So I think going forward, now we have the benefit of including them. They are part of our larger network. So quite frankly, it's up to a client. If the client wants to see savings beyond, they could choose a more limited network. For those clients that want the broader networks, they have that option. It's our job to provide a wide array of products and offerings that meet those clients' needs and that's our focus.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","How narrow do you have to narrow your network to drive some material saving?","George Paz","It depends on geographic location. If there's -- again, these aren't just simple answer. In the market, where you have very high competition between the retail pharmacies, excluding one, means that all those numbers can be now diverted to the other pharmacy. And they're willing to drop rates for that. In other markets, where the competition may not be as strong and the client sees that they want that bigger pharmacy chain in, then it doesn't do you a lot of good to exclude them. So I think it's really on a regional-by-regional basis. But keep in mind, some people have talked about maybe you can only save $1. Saving $1 per prescription is a tremendous amount of money. We're talking with Express Scripts processing 1.4 billion prescriptions per year. $1 is $1.4 billion. You tell me a company today that's running 1 million prescriptions through their SG&A line, that if they can save $1 billion doing something that doesn't cause a lot of disruption that they wouldn't do it, $0.50 is worth doing. As an ex-CFO, when I go through our budgets and I go through our forecast with my CFO, Jeff, we're constantly looking for pennies. You got to start with pennies to get dollars. And so everything is important that really doesn't involve anything that has some material negative effect on your employees. We've been able to prove that, that limiting networks, limiting formularies, changing access, putting in clinical programs, all those things can reach tremendous desired results without employee disruption. So we're pretty excited about what we can bring to the table.","Operator","And our next question will come from Larry Marsh with Barclays.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","George and Jeff, so just following up on Tom's question about overall synergy expectations. You guys are communicating pretty clearly today that you're able to accelerate the timing of some of these savings of SG&A saves, which you haven't changed the ultimate target of $1 billion. I just [indiscernible] when you first announced Medco last July was estimated synergies of $1 billion. Back in May, you described that as net synergies of $1 billion and you're confirming that today. So just remind us what you mean by net synergies. And from a timing standpoint, when might you be in a position to revisit those ultimate synergy assumptions?","George Paz","Well, I'll take the first stab at that, then Jeff can give it proper classification and color. From my perspective of net synergy means what we're bringing to you as our shareholders. So there's going to be numbers that we're going to gain and that we're going to pass on for our clients. And synergy takes a lot of different forms, to the extent that our product people develop new clinical programs that help lower costs and drive down waste, that can be considered a synergy. And we're constantly looking to do that. Obviously, the clients are going to gain the market share -- the lion's share of those numbers. Our view today is that our operations people have worked very hard in order to make sure that as we came into this acquisition, we had a good idea where our staffing levels needed to be. As you know, last year, Medco had a bit of a tough year with the CalPERS and the FEP and some of the other situations. And so our first drive was in order to rightsize the ship and get the right level of people to meet the service levels, which our clients need in order to meet their needs and at the same time, make sure that we have the right people in place to drive the company into the future. So that was our -- that was where our focus was. Because we were given an extended period of time by the government as they reviewed the acquisition, we had more time to plan and get things in place. So once we closed the deal, we were able to go in and quickly prudently focus on getting it both rightsized, and we did that. So that accelerated the SG&A savings and some DPC savings into the current year -- into the current quarter, which helped us. There's an awful lot that still needs to be done, whether it's contracting networks, whether it's getting the formularies put together, working with all the pharmaceutical manufacturers, on and on. I mean there's a whole lot of things that need to be done in order to put these 2 companies together, one of which, which is very large, of course, is getting to one platform. We are very proud and feel great about our employees' focus that we're able to get the first tier of our membership move. We're ready to move the next tier in just a couple of weeks. And so we're well on our path continuing those efforts. The sooner we can get that done, the sooner we can eliminate all the significant costs associated with multiple platforms and development regulatory costs, and we're on that path. Now to revise the number, it gets kind of complicated, Larry, just because we are a -- we're all in the same business, so we start putting things together. Our people are very focused on continuing to drive value for our clients, and the number starts to get a little more blended together, if you will. So what the synergy versus what's truly just a pure operating gain because our operations people figured out a better way to present our prescriptions through our automated systems. Our systems people have a better methodology for processing claims. As we gain those opportunities on top of the combinations, the blurriness between the synergies gets a little bit confusing, if you will. So our view is, and I think we feel very good about the $1 billion, we'll continue to focus on that. But at the end of the day, the next quarter, 30, 90 days or so from now, we'll be in a position to give guidance into 2013. And that will be our indication, and we'll give you some more -- a better view on where we think numbers are coming in.","Lawrence C. Marsh - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Great, okay. And just a quick clarification follow-up, Jeff, maybe on interest expense, $530 million is a bit lower than I was thinking so it must be a pretty good stepdown to third quarter of maybe $115 million or so. Can you remind us what's driving that? Is that a good run rate for next year? And then the other quick clarification, in the Q, you talked about Medco's network participation with Walgreens remaining in place under existing terms. I know you don't want to talk too specific about that but you can make any comments about whether that's existing terms? Or is that all under one new agreement as you disclosed?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Yes. So interest expense, I think it's real simple. The -- we prepaid or paid off $1.5 billion of bonds that were outstanding. Those bonds had an average rate of 5.9%, and we're continuing to see low-floating interest rate. So we've got low rates on our large [indiscernible] floating rate bonds. That's what's driving our interest rate down from where it was in Q1 and Q2. $530 million for the year, we expect it to be pretty flat from Q3 to Q4. So if you fall for that and have the 2 quarters be about the same in Q3 and Q4, you can get pretty close to the right numbers. I'll let George take the second part.","George Paz","Yes. As far as the Walgreens contract, keep in mind that we just entered into a new contract with them, and it covers the entire book of business, both Medco legacy and Express Scripts. But it doesn't take effect until September. While the contracts, of course, [indiscernible] our current membership don't access Walgreens until September. So for those legacy numbers, we still have the Medco contract that's operational and working.","Operator",".","And we'll go to the line of Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Just a couple of quick questions. George and Jeff, I was kind of curious to ask about the gross margins. The gross margins look particularly strong. And I guess I'm trying to figure out how much of that was driven organically, I guess, by incremental contribution from generics this quarter? Or how much of that was synergy driven? Because yes, I noticed the generic dispensing rate was a little higher than we thought and maybe the mail order rate -- mail order claims were a little bit higher than what we would have thought. So any clarity around that?","George Paz","Well, I'll put a couple of things and then Jeff can give you some of the number stuff. But clearly, the generic is a strong driver, as you know, through our model of alignment, getting where we can pull through additional opportunities, both through clinical programs and generic fill rates, drugs losing their patent protection, all add to value for our clients and to us -- for our shareholders. So those are all very positive things. The other thing, which we already talked about, was our operations people are very diligent. Pat McNamee brought his team together and made sure that we were focused on day 1 of getting this -- the right people and the right job and the right headcount, and we've been working very diligently at that. So as we bring out -- as we rightsize the boat again, it took a lot of cost out of the equation and allowed us to bring down our TPC cost, again, which I guess, clearly, is synergistic. But it's also things we do constantly to make sure that we're on the right track here. So that's going to continue to be our focus, as we continue to look forward and drive numbers. I don't know, Jeff.","Jeffrey L. Hall","No. I think that's right. I mean, obviously, the mode of alignment we talked about a lot has worked really well for us over the years. When generic fill rates go up, when mail penetration goes up, when clinical programs start to execute, we're saving our clients money on the drug spend. We're now starting to save them money on the medical spend as well. And in keeping with that model, that helps our gross profit. So that's the primary driver. As I said earlier, we didn't see much synergy the second quarter coming through gross profit. We do expect to see some in the third and fourth quarters, especially gross profit.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And Jeff, maybe if I can just ask one follow-up question on generics, and I understand you guys don't want to comment at all on fiscal '13 at this point. But what I'm trying to gauge is, obviously, you saw a bunch of big generics lose their exclusivity in the first half of this year, and as we look to the back half of calendar '12, there's a fair amount of generic introductions that are coming. And so I'm just trying to think, from a very high level of perspective, how I should think about generics in '13 versus '12? Is it fair to say that you're obviously going to get the full 12-month contribution from all these big generics next year in '13, so it could actually be bigger than '12. Is that a fair way to characterize it?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Hard to answer that question without providing '13 guidance, which I'm not prepared to do today. We're, at this point, focused on executing on the year. We're happy with where the year is going. We're seeing positive uptick in the year. We're happy with the execution of integration and synergy, and that's our focus. And you're going to have to wait a little while longer to get us to comment specifically on '13.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I was wondering if maybe you could just talk about the underlying mail trends that you're seeing. Obviously, they're stronger in the quarter. As we go through the Q, you talked about mail conversion. So George or Jeff, can you comment on what you saw around mail conversion, perhaps related to the dispute with Walgreens or any other programs that you have in place, that are going to continue to drive mail? And then secondly, can you give us an idea of what your underlying mail growth was in the quarter?","George Paz","We can both take on parts of that, Lisa. First of all, the dispute with Walgreens clearly helped mail. Those members who -- people -- as you know, from our whole discussion around behavioral sciences, getting people to move off of a status quo is not easy. And when an event occurs, such as losing Walgreens out of the network, that was a real motivator and driver for people to take action. And so as they were looking at the possibilities obviously, we informed them of the benefits of mail order. There's no question our services, undeniably the best in the industry, and as we lever that to provide the value back to the membership, they've taken advantage of that, and that's driven mail. The other thing we shouldn't lose sight of is joining me on my senior staff as part of the acquisition was 2 very, very sharp individuals from Medco, who grew up in a business that was very, very good at driving mail. And so both Glen and Tim have that focus. They know the value. They bring a fresh new look into how we can promote mail in front of our clients. And so it fell through the account management and sales side, as well as the product development side. These 2 individuals have been able to really take us to a new level, and we'll continue to focus on that. So we're excited about how our staff has come together with some new ideas, some new focuses using therapeutic resource centers in combination, with our Consumerology, has added a lot of value to our clients and will continue to drive mail.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Do you have any numbers on the underlying mail growth?","Jeffrey L. Hall","No, we're not going to break it out. I think I'm just -- I mirror what George says. There's a couple of things we know. Adherence goes up at mail, price to the member and to the client goes down. We got a lot of great ideas. We're going to keep driving it, and we're confident that we can continue to improve outcomes and lower cost by getting more people into our mail program.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And obviously, much figure. And then secondly, no one has asked thus far about the selling season. George, can you comment on how the selling season has gone thus far? How receptive clients are to the new offering? You have potentially the 95%, but can you maybe talk about how you've been able to win any new customers as well in the selling season?","George Paz","Yes, we're -- on our prepared comments, I mentioned we had 125 new wins to date this year. I think we feel very good about where we stand. We historically -- new wins are very important to us. But quite frankly, retaining the business and growing what we do and adding value is the most important thing we can do. I think it's always a little dangerous if you just focus purely on sales, especially when you get to a fairly large size. Because keep in mind, winning new business, there's lower margin. There's a lot of start-up costs. There's a lot of effort that goes into that. That doesn't mean it's not worthwhile. But clearly, the focus has to be on maintaining what we have and growing it and bringing value to those clients. That's going to be the biggest drivers of value enhancement. And when we look out to the future, obviously, we always want to have new wins, because new wins validates our business principles and who we are. But it's also we're not willing to -- we -- as you know, Lisa, we've always walked a very fine line between making sure that the value we add to our customers and the price we're going to deliver so that we can add value to our shareholders has to be balanced. And we're going to maintain that discipline, and we're going to maintain that balance in everything we do. And our job is to make sure we grow best in class for our shareholders on our share value, and that's where our focus is and to make sure we perform for our shareholders and at the same time, perform for our clients. So we feel good about our selling season, and we feel good where we stand. And obviously, this has been an interesting year without Walgreens in the early part of the year. That really wasn't a big negative, though, at the end of the day. For -- as I said in the past, in certain areas such as managed care, it's a little bit harder because often, they have a different type of offering that they're reselling our services out to the public. So that's a little tougher, which clearly on the commercial side, the commercial clients are really looking for savings and what's good for their membership. So again, I think we feel very good about where we sit.","Operator","And we'll go to the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","George, do you have an early read or some type of internal target on how many of your customers will bring Walgreens back into the network next year?","George Paz","We do, but I'm not going to mention it. I don't think -- because they're a public company. I don't think we should be the one driving them. I think that from my perspective, I'm incredibly appreciative of what all of other retail pharmacies did to help us through that period. I'm also very appreciative of what Walgreens has done to come back into our network. So we -- our clients are working with our account teams, and they're deciding where they want to go. We, obviously, track that. But I prefer not to get into that level of detail.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And maybe, George, just to be difficult, when Express Scripts had been buying stock, it's historically been a signal that there's no open deal coming. Why are we rolling this time around?","George Paz","Bob, we just closed on this 4 months ago. Can you give me a chance to get a breath?  Well, we are -- we -- as you know, we really have a focus here of making sure we deploy our capital and manage our capital structure in the best way possible for our shareholders, and we will continue to do that. And we won't lose sight of what our drive is, which is to increase shareholder value every year. So we've got to focus.","Operator","And we'll go to John Kreger with William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on the selling season, George. On a net basis, do you expect at this point to be up or down for -- as you move into January of '13?","George Paz","We -- net-net, it should be up. But it's still kind of early because we haven't gotten through all of the renewal season, and we still haven't gotten through all of the new sales opportunities. You also got to be careful because some of my competitors would count things like utilization and inflation and net new win. And we've never done that. So you really have to parse apart what's driving it. If one of my clients -- the reason we lose a lot of the business that we lose is because companies combine, and we'll find ourselves having half the business, somebody else having the other half and then they make the decision. More times than not, the company that's -- the buying company goes with their -- they had chosen who they had wanted to work with, and so the survivors choose the winner. And that typically is what happens here. Now if you gain a whole bunch of scripts through that method is that net new business? This is -- a lot of people would count it that way. It just really depends, so what we really try to do is look at script growth over a period of time and again, balance that between new business wins, again, to validate our model versus enhancing shareholder value to our shareholders. So it's really too early to get too deep into this conversation. Hopefully, we'll be in a position on the next quarterly call to give you a little better color as we project out next year's script count.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Very helpful. That's actually a good segue. The follow-up was, if you look at your legacy business, are you seeing any changes in per-capita utilization, given the -- all the headlines about the economy at present?","George Paz","That still is a very troubling factor. When I have a chance to talk to our Chief Medical Officer, Dr. Miller, and we look at what's taking place in the underlying numbers. It's very scary, John. It's troubling when you see people with diabetes and heart conditions and some pretty severe situations that aren't taking their medications to the level that they should be. I assume it's the economy driving it, we've faced it now for 3 years, kind of caught us a bit by surprise last year. As you know, we thought we saw in early in the year that trends were starting to warm up and things were starting to take off a little bit and then they fell back flat again. We're seeing it again this year. Trends are -- utilization trends are remaining relatively flat. At the same time, the manufacturers, because they're not getting the pull-through with all of the utilization we've historically seen, have been raising prices on an unprecedented basis. And so both in oral solids and in specialty products, we're seeing inflation rates that are quite large. And so we're doing everything we can to work with our clients to give them alternatives through clinical programs, prior authorizations, step therapies, primary management and other programs to try to help them combat the ever-increasing cost of those drug therapies. So it's a good and it's bad. Obviously, our tools are needed more than ever to help clients to control their costs. At the same time, it's a bit frustrating when we see costs rising at 4x and 5x the cost of inflation. So it's a difficult situation.","Operator","And our next question will come from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Last quarter, George, I think you highlighted Medicare -- Medicaid business as a driver to performance in the quarter. And it's been an important growth driver for your clients obviously. Have you seen any impact this quarter? And how do you think about this business segment going forward? And then on the Walgreens side, to your point, Walgreens wasn't a big negative for you throughout the year. So what has been client reaction to the announcement that Walgreen is back in the network, if any?","George Paz","Medicaid will continue to be a very important component of our business. It's mostly managed through our health plan side, our managed care division. And many, many of our clients have a focus on both Medicare and Medicaid. Our job is to produce the tools and reporting and the information that they need to meet the needs of the different states as they roll out their programs. So it clearly, end of this year, Medicaid has been a big driver for us, and I suspect it's going to stay that way as we go into 2013 and '14. It's an area of growth -- of significant growth. So it's something we're very focused on. As far as Walgreens is concerned, again, this is like anything else, whether it's formulary or whatever. It's really a client-by-client decision. Our job isn't to go to in and suggest or force clients to choose mail, to choose formularies, to do anything. Our job is to lay out choices. Our job is to just come in and lay down -- here's, okay, what is the need of the client? There are some companies that are in the professional services business and you are highly contesting for employment. Chances are you're going to have a pretty open flexible plan design. If you're in a very difficult business facing tremendous competition and your margins are declining, then you're going to be much more focused on cost. So our job is to roll out and give clients the option to make the decisions they need to meet their cost objectives. So again, the answer is different for every client. Some clients are excited to have the opportunity to go back into Walgreens. And other clients are, quite frankly, because of [indiscernible], are more willing to sacrifice that access in order to keep the cost savings that they can enjoy. So it's really a client-by-client decision.","Operator","And the next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Actually, maybe just some housekeeping questions. Jeff, you kind of mentioned that you're evaluating some of the businesses that you have going forward. As you know, we look at the segment breakout. Obviously, it looks like the other revenue in the core PBM is probably a little bit lower. It looks like you kind of moved some things around. Can you just talk about sort of what's kind of moved and maybe what you're looking at as non-core?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Sure. The -- so yes, you're absolutely right, we did change our segments around. It made a lot of sense to kind of recalibrate the segments based on what we have now. So essentially, we're in 2 segments: the PBM and the PBM businesses, which for the most part is the U.S. and the Canadian PBM, and the specialty businesses are in the PBM segment and then everything else is in the kind of other businesses segment. And so that is -- and it's detailed in the Q, but it is our international businesses, both the historic Express Scripts international, as well as the Medco international. It's liberty, it's UBC, it's the other subsidiaries that legacy Medco organization had, as well as the distribution business that we have and other businesses. So we're -- looking at strategic alternatives, we think it's too early to really go into details and name names. But a lot of these businesses aren't core and don't have the kind of return on invested capital metrics that we'd like to see. And therefore, we are going to sell them or just exit them over the next several quarters. And just to be clear, we don't expect these sales or these exits to have a material impact on the overall results of the company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And also maybe on the share count here. You're still guiding to about 750 million. We're actually getting 324 million a quarter. Can you talk about how we should expect that to ramp up in the back half? [indiscernible] in the third quarter [indiscernible]? Or is it kind of the ramp that you expect people to exercise options as part of, I guess, maybe of severance packages?","Jeffrey L. Hall","The truth is I don't know. You were using 750 million. That's our best estimate. The big swing factor here and is how legacy Medco employees exercise their stock options, and there's no easy way for us to predict that. 750 million is our best example. I would expect it probably to ramp slightly over time. That's how I'm modeling it internally. But I think just for modeling purposes, we're forcing the model at 750 million for the year. If it comes in different than that, then the EPS could change. But quite frankly, it's hard to predict how that's going to come through.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. So then one last follow-up question, on tax rate, obviously, you're saying 37%, 38% for that back half or I guess I'm sorry, regarding full year 38% to 39%, which kind of imply the back half is sort of 37% to 38%. Shall we think of that back half really -- is really the more normalized tax rate going forward.","Jeffrey L. Hall","No, we think the -- as I said in my prepared remarks, the effective tax rate for the company is 39%. Our goal over time is to get that as low as possible, although I don't expect that rate to change significantly over the next year or 2. So I think 39% is the rate. We've got a lot of integration, other things to do to get that rate down a little bit. And of course, it's always dangerous to talk about tax rate, given all the legislative potential on that. But our current view is 39% as the rate for the year and going forward. And that as a result, the second quarter had some year-to-date catch-up, some other purchase accounting related items in it, which forced the rate up, which means to get 39% for the year, we end up with kind of 37.5% to 38% in the back half. That's what gives us 39% for the year.","Operator","And your final question this morning comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","George and Jeff, so just -- I just had a question just on the synergies for 2012 and for 2013. When you talked about that for calendar '12, SG&A will be the bigger synergy opportunity. And obviously, what's been visible to the investment community is the new drug wholesaling contract starting October? You obviously have a new retail pharmacy reimbursement contract for the large chains starting mid September. So I guess my question is, as we kind of think about going into 2013, should we see more synergy from COGS versus SG&A? And also just overall, when we think about retail pharmacy network pricing, again, without getting too granular, is that a meaningful part of the overall synergy opportunity tied into the merger? I just wanted to get more color on that as well.","George Paz","Yes. The -- we're not prepared to talk about '13 today. The numbers that we hope to gain or we will gain through the course of the next -- the third and fourth quarter are embedded in the guidance range that Jeff gave you. So that's where we're at for those numbers. As we look out to 2013, there's a lot of things that drive synergy. And that's why it starts getting clouded when we look out into the next year because again, clients are going to -- a lot of it is going to depend on where the economy is as well. If the economy doesn't improve, things remain relatively tough. More and more clients are going to be looking at more and more options to drive out cost. As those realizations or those things -- events become real, then they're going to be coming out to look for those opportunities. And clearly, narrower networks are going to be an option. So the question is it's very important for us to go and look for the best pricing between the 2 different, so if we each have a contract with retail pharmacy, a, we look at who's got the best deal and try to get all the business into the better deals. We're going to do that over time. In addition to that is also the new products that Glenn and his team are going to be rolling out and that we're going to be offering to our clients. They're going to help us to help drive value for our clients and drive value for our shareholders. So it does get a bit blurry as you move into this, but we are very, very focused on continuing to drive value, and we look forward to the next quarter when we can give you guidance into '13.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, maybe just one real quick -- just a clarification question. That 95% retention rate, there's always nuances on the definition of that. So I'm wondering for your 95% that you're disclosing, is that just number of customers? Or is that percentage of revenues? I want to make sure that we understand that percentage properly.","George Paz","Yes. We've always done this the same way here, and it's 95% of all claims that we look at. I think when you start getting the small clients, some undecided to carve in, some carve out, it's this kind of clients that can be pretty misleading. So we look at claim counts, and we've always done it the same way since we've been in business so...","All right. Well, thank you, all -- everyone for joining us on today's second quarter earnings call. We're really excited about where we sit. We believe that as pharmaceutical manufacturers have continued to raise prices, as clients continue to look for opportunities, what's really been fun, I think, over the last 14, 15 years that I've been here is to watch the clients as they've grown, and they've had a better understanding of value that comes through the PBM. And our tools have only gotten sharper and better, and the clients have become more receptive. Years ago, trying to roll out, go from 2-tier formularies to 3-tier formularies, was a huge undertaking. Now most plans have them. And when you look at narrower networks or you look at mail programs or you look at other savings opportunities, the receptivity of our teams to roll out new and exciting engaging programs that help take down costs, while improving health outcome, is growing with momentum. And we're excited about the position we sit in. We're excited about our future. We look forward to keeping -- continually updating you on our synergy quest, as well as our integration progress. So until next quarter, we'll talk again soon. Take care. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today.

Before I begin, allow me to briefly introduce myself. As George said, I had a long career with Ernst & Young representing many large corporations and I have been fortunate to work with lots of exceptional executives, who I\u2019ve worked with on many different matters including financials, strategic and operational matters. In my short time at Express Scripts, it\u2019s clear to me the team is focused on and passionate about their business, they've driven to succeed. As the managing partner of Ernst & Young, I\u2019ve had experience with a variety of industries and companies across the U.S. and it's been in my long time in St. Louis has been a lot of fun to watch the growth of Express Scripts over the years.","I am honored to serve as the CFO and look forward to working with all of you. This morning I am happy to report fourth quarter earnings and overall financial performance in line with our expectations. We adjudicated 337 million claims slightly ahead of our expectations, generating EBITDA of 1.857 billion, which results in EBITDA per claim of $5.51. Excluding the impact of UnitedHealth Group EBITDA was up 13% and EBITDA per claim was up 18% from the prior year. SG&A was driven lower year-over-year in the fourth quarter, we will continue to focus on efficiencies to deliver SG&A improvements across the company and drive a competitive cost structure.","As expected we generated 2.9 billion of cash flow during the quarter, we primarily used that cash flow to retire debt and repurchase 10.1 million shares or 819.5 million, we also delivered EPS of $1.39 representing growth of 26% over last year excluding United. We also delivered solid financial results for the full year 2014; we adjudicated approximately 1.31 billion claims which were at the upper end of our full year guidance. We delivered EBITDA of 6.8 billion matching the midpoint of our range.","Our EBITDA per claim was $5.19 which represents 13% growth excluding the impact of United. We generated $4.88 or earnings per diluted share which was the midpoint of our guidance range and represent 18% growth over last year excluding the impact of United. While SG&A was up sequentially to ramp up for a successful 1\/1 we continued to drive down SG&A during '14 spending roughly 1.07 billion. Full year cash flow from operations was 4.55 billion; we deployed 7.4 billion of cash during 2014, 4.6 billion to repurchase common stock and 2.8 billion to retire debt.","Overall 2014 delivered strong results consistent with our overall expectations. As we turn towards '15, we're focused on achieving our guidance for the year and positioning the company for longer term growth. Similar to 2014 these ranges exclude non-recurring integration expanses which we expect to continue in '15. As we said on our last investor call during the fourth quarter of 2014 we focused on our 2015 1\/1 and as a result our integrating effort was not absolutely complete at the end of the year.","We now anticipate integration cost will be approximately 250 million during 2015 primarily related to the first half of the year. Despite the headwind of lower retention rates in 2014 our adjusted EPS is expected to increase in the range of 10% to 13% in 2015, adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase 2% to 5% in 2015. At the midpoint we expect our 2015 adjusted claims to be down slightly.","We will continue to reduce SG&A in the range of 3% to 7% with more cost efficiencies and synergies as a result of integrating our back office system, continued rationalization of our foot print and decommissioning legacy systems. Our capital structure for 2015 will remain consistent with prior years, unless we identify a strategic alternative we will continue to maintain leverage at approximately two times debt to EBITDA and we'll return the majority of our free cash flow to our shareholders.","With respect to the first quarter of '15 we expect EPS to be in a range of $1.07 to $1.11, as expected this is a sequential decline from Q4 that represents growth over Q1 2014 of 8% to 12%. We anticipate the quarterly progression of EPS growth in '15 will be similar to '14.","I'll now turn the call over to Tim.","Tim Wentworth","Thanks Tim and good morning. As George mentioned at the beginning of the call we look forward to hosting many of you tomorrow at our investor day. We plan to go into greater detail about our Express Scripts\u2019 unique combination of client alignment and bold action is expected to translate into growth. We are excited to share our story and having visited our innovative lab, our world class pharmacy and to spot light our specialist pharmacists who deliver superior care to patients.","With that in mind I want to quickly highlight a few areas today and we'll go into depth more tomorrow. It was just a year ago that I was named President of Express Scripts, and when I contrast where we are today to where we were in January of 2014, there are few things that come immediately to mind. First, we are delivering great service, after an unacceptable 1\/1 performance past year we invested heavily to position ourselves for success.","We made significant operational leadership changes, added targeted resources and most importantly we return to the core elements of service that our clients and patients expect. As a result this past 1\/1\/15 was the very best in our history. We're stronger than historical norms in all PDM and pharmacy service measures. Second, we're driving change in healthcare, we have a heritage of leadership in the areas that matter most to clients, improving health outcomes and controlling costs.","We build upon that heritage with bold action we took to expand access to all Hepatitis C patients who needed curative treatment. Aligned with our clients we move quickly to lower the costs to cure to a level where every Hepatitis C patient, not just the sickest but all patients can be cured. You have seen the ripple effect our action has creased. We believe that our clients alone could save more than $1 billion this year and nationally the cost of caring for Hepatitis C patients to be reduced by up to 4 billion as a direct result of our leadership. We have momentum, our strong 1\/1 combined with our build actions to improve health outcome has resulted in the renewal of several key health plan accounts. It is a similar story in our commercial book of business and we find there is strong interest from prospects and benefitted values. Looking forward, I anticipate our retention rate for 2016 will return to the 94% to 97% range. With our client migration behind us we are moving forward the strong momentum, client and prospects are focused on where we\u2019re going and not where we\u2019ve been and they need us more than ever. We are full aligned with the interest of our clients, we have the will to act and we are well positioned for future growth.","I look forward to seeing many of you in person tonight and tomorrow in St. Louis and have the opportunity to share with you in more detail how we bend across curves through bold actions and alignment; we\u2019ll talk more tomorrow, but for now let me turn it over to George.","George Paz","Thanks, Tim and good morning, everyone. As I look back on 2014, I am proud of our company. We faced unexpected challenges and we experienced a lot of change. However, we finished the year with strong results both financially and operationally. We delivered double-digit growth in our EPS to our shareholders in 2014 and I believe our execution on 1\/1\/15 was the best time in company\u2019s history. Looking ahead and factoring our less than expected retention rate in \u201914, I am pleased with our \u201915 earnings guidance of 5.35 to 5.49 which represents 10% to 13% growth in EPS.","At our Investor Day tomorrow we will provide greater details on how we uniquely solve the major challenges for health plans we\u2018re facing and how we innovate solutions -- how our innovative solutions drive our growth. I want to take a moment now to preview and highlight two concepts that uniquely differentiate Express Scripts. The first concept is alignment, our modeled alignment means we\u2019ll create value for our clients by delivering quality care to members; we negotiate with pharmaceutical manufacturers and pharmacies to bring down the cost of drug so patients can access the best medicine through the best channel. We have no other agenda; we are not tied to the supply chain or distribution channel. So we are fully aligned with what works best for our clients and our patients. The second concept is action; we have never shied away from taking on a tough challenge. We alone have challenged pharmaceutical manufacturers and retail pharmacies to drive the changes in healthcare this country needs. We have generated significant savings while improving health outcomes for our clients to do better management of pharmacy networks and formulary. We have revolutionized the practice of pharmacy for patients by uniquely combining Consumerology, Therapeutic Resource Centers and Actionable Data. Our models of alignment positions us to be channel agnostic and allows us to take bold actions no one else is willing to take.","When we look at what we have done with Hepatitis C treatment and the other actions we have taken in other therapeutic areas it boils down to two simple ideas, alignment and action. Those two words define our heritage and our future. We have spent nearly three years following the acquisition of Medco doing the hard work to build the company well positioned and prepared for the future. We look forward to speaking tomorrow and sharing our view of the road ahead and why we\u2019re excited about our journey. Before we turn this over to questions, I like to take a moment to recognize John Parker who recently retired from our Board of Directors. John has been a member of our Board since July 2001. John is an IT expert with extensive experience in the healthcare -- as a healthcare executive. He was a tremendous resource and key advisor for our management team and I want to personally thank John on behalf of myself and our entire organization for his service to our company.","Unfortunately, John health was such that he felt it necessary to retire from our Board. His contributions will be greatly missed. Thank you, John.","Thanks for all of your attention today. Now we\u2019ll turn it over for questions. Questions operator.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We\u2019ll now begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JP Morgan. Your line is now open.","Lisa Gill","Tim, can you maybe just talk a little bit more about the 2016 selling season. How would you characterize it, you talked about some renewals you already had on the managed care side, but maybe if you could break it down for us to -- just how you think about managed care versus employer for renewals for 2016 and can you tuck-in all at this point as to how much is already renewed and the early parts of the selling season?","Tim Wentworth","A breakdown just a way, first of all let me start with the macro which is, we believe we\u2019re strongly positioned but we\u2019re taking nothing for granted. So while we like the momentum that we have both operationally and from a thought leadership perspective and those have changed the conversation as it relates to every segment of the marketplace. We recognize that we continue to have clients that have real challenges and the way we're meeting this challenges directly results in how well we're going to show in renewal as is also longer term winning new business.","When you look at the managed care side clearly they\u2019re focused on -- in most cases being regulatory compliant, rock solid in terms of delivery of service to their members and in that respect being where we sit today as well as where we really came into the back half of last year, positions us well for both renewals which typically occur earlier in the selling season and that's one of the things that gives us the confidence that we have now to give you the range that we gave you, is that we've been operationally rock solid, we've been regulatory in a very good spot and they recognize that and rewarded us with renewals and we expect that will continue as we work through the first probably half of this year as it relates to managed care.","From an employer perspective they have some of the same challenges, but clearly as we look at most of our employers 95% of most I believe the number is now -- our international preferred preliminary bending the cost curve for them directly is the thing they really are looking at and what we did not only with Hepatitis C but much more broadly with a very well managed formulary which leveraged the things we do to take care of their members has positioned us we think very, very well as it relates to renewing those clients.","It is earlier in the season for those clients, our hope is that over the next couple of quarters we can tighten the range for you little bit in terms of what we've given you from a retention standpoint. But right now across those segments it looks really good for us in terms of our course story and a chance to really tell it.","Lisa Gill","Is there a way to put -- to quantify that the number -- the size of your total renewals for 2016?","George Paz","We can give you a number, all I would say it is not at all unusual in terms of the other percentage of our business that was in renewal with.","Lisa Gill","And then if I could just squeeze in one follow up, when you talked about the national formulary towards I think historically you gave a number last quarter where you talked about total savings approaching $1 billion for your clients. Is still that the right number to think about that's in the guidance for 2015?","George Paz","Absolutely. The beauty of it is the savings compounds because once you set the floor the drugs actually raise at a fairly high rate and those savings rise as well. So the clients get the benefit of added on to, if you will the impact of double-digit inflation and savings. So I think as Tim said this is a real seller for us, because all of this is clinically based and it really does meet our client\u2019s objectives while saving them money and making money for our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Robert Willoughby with Bank of America. Your line is now open.","Robert Willoughby","George, one of the criticisms you often get is the benefits at your bold actions are accruing somewhat to your competitors, in the better new business rate or commentary that are on and it's somewhat hard to refute. Are you able to at least comment on the possibility for more signature account signings this year, the likelihood of that versus some prior years and what kind of flavor can you give towards payers attitude, towards what you have accomplished?","George Paz","It's interesting because when we took our actions, even when Dr. Miller first appeared in front of Congress and then later on CNBC and a lot of the newspaper articles. We're getting very high accolades from our clients, especially in the managed care area but also in the commercial area. Think of if it -- you're a governor and you've got a fairly -- all governors have a fairly high prison population and Hepatitis C runs ramping there, you got to pay for this in Medicare -- Medicaid cost on top of that.","These executives are facing huge challenges and our actions speak to who you are and what we do. I always believe you need to be a leader not a follower. And this is an area where leadership really does matter. We got out in front of this; we get a lot of credit for those I think it meant a lot to quite a few of our renewals in our managed care space. We had a challenging 1\/1 last year but I think of who we are and what we deliver year-in, year-out if you would have bought a little bit a forgiveness for that 1\/1 and obviously we had to get back on track and which we did through service. But I do think it speaks to it, it's way too early in the year -- this year to know how the accounts are going to fare, but I think at the end of the day we have a mission which is to reduce the cost of healthcare in America while improving their health outcomes and I think we speak to that better than anybody.","Totally agnostic from a delivery mechanism, that puts us in the best position to get all forms savings out of the supply chain. So we're excited about where we sit.","Robert Willoughby","And just a quick one for Jim, is there a debt reduction target we take out the short-term debt or are you likely to turn that out and what does the guidance assume on share buybacks?","Jim Havel","They're going to -- in terms of debt payback, we're going to -- certainly have to hit our obligations for the year, but really we're going to try to maintain a two times ratio as I indicated earlier. So there is really not going to be any change there. And then any excess cash that we generate will continue to return to shareholders through share buyback. That's really the plan, I mean it can be interrupted by unforeseen circumstances and opportunities, but really that's our plan.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Eric Percher with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Eric Percher","As you round up the year, you finished the year, I\u2019d be curious to hear about any new plan design trends that you're seeing in maybe particularly relative to consumer cost share and benefit design, I know we saw more seasonality last year and it sounded like that trend is likely to continue?","George Paz","Yes, what I say is that you continue to see migration although in our book it looked fairly penetrated in high deductible or other sort of what you define is consumer plan design, I would say you did not see any significant migration to the private exchanges this year. So plans have decided to use their indebted plan designs to manage the member consumer sort of behavior. I would tell you though that what you continue to see plan doing after a couple of years of just using plan design in some cases is that narrow formularies, so we didn\u2019t have any backsliding of our formulary to the contrary, quite great deal of incremental uptick from the few clients that we\u2019re still on their own formulary and I will point to have kind of seeing that, we believe -- I was looking for the number yesterday, but 95% of our commercial book of business minus a few of those accounts have now narrowed our -- their patients with Hepatitis C with single pharmacy, Accredo; and we see high level of receptivity given the way we managed the overall spend for our clients at least to increasingly narrow member choices in areas where we can provide a superior outcome both financially and clinically.","So, we\u2019re talking [Well] again, probably more of so than we have been in the last couple of years certainly specialty both step therapy and formulary as well as narrowing the pharmacy network continues to be our large focus, I think [indiscernible] a huge focus, the compounding challenges that our clients face with a real stimulant to some programs we had developed in our lab that were very unique, we actually developed them with some of our clients in the lab and the uptick in our [indiscernible] program has been very strong as well. Again things to essentially surround the consumer benefit with good management where it would actually makes a difference.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky Goldwasser","One key area the market is focused on is the success of the integrated model and just overall in employers being more channel agnostic than they have been in the past. George can you share with us kind of like, your thought on the value of potentially partnering with the retailer?","George Paz","We partner with many, many retailers and I think that\u2019s the beauty of our model, we\u2019re not limited to one. We do a lot of business with CVS and in the right market, in the right areas they are great partner, likewise WalGreens is a great partner in other markets and on and on, I think it really depends on what the client needs now to what is our delivery system or what is our product, our product has to ultimately meet client demand in certain regions some powerful grocery stores and other regions if you look at from real cost savings that made up of Walmart and some of the other big box stores meets their clients\u2019 needs. We like to position to find out what does that client need and then take them a delivery mechanism that\u2019s going to drive the end game and drive that use.","I\u2019ve always said, we can train pharmacist so really hope that patient walk through step therapies or through prior authorization, but pharmacist isn\u2019t going to look at one set of clients, say okay I\u2019m going to take care of these with the other 60% of people I see, I\u2019m going to let them suffer. So once we train them right, once we get our partners to work with us, they treat all patients which is really good, but the idea is that forcing our formulary, then really is driving cost down of course our book of business and helping our clients meet their needs and drive better health outcomes for those patients through adherence programs and so it really is in our mind to have an approach where we can say agnostic and chose the right partner in the right area to deliver the right value and that\u2019s what we\u2019re totally focused on.","Ricky Goldwasser","And one follow-up question on the Hep C market, since you were kind of the like the first movers on your decision, did declaring an announcement of the gross to net of 40% plus surprised you at all in context of the economics that you are getting from [Ambien]?","George Paz","Not at all, we stayed -- it's not like you go and do something ones and then just leave the market. We monitor the market, we stay on top of it, our job is not one and done, our job is to control cost throughout the year and so when opportunity avail itself -- keep in mind we\u2019re talking about a big powerful drug here with a lot of users, but there is things taking place every day with API shortages, with the drug is not being in stock, with other opportunities to go into the marketplace and get better pricing on generic. Our team and the supply chain focus very diligently on making sure we maximize our position throughout the course of the year to drive better value and I think we\u2019re second to none in this area.","Tim Wentworth","If I could just add, I would just remind you we chose the drug for national differed formulary, we have a very constructive relationship with Gullane, our job is to make sure that we're able to go on with the entire supply chain on behalf of clients and support some of their decisions, they are able to leverage our strength, our contracts, irrespective of the manufacturer and it was not a surprise when we saw that towards that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Glen Santangelo","George just wants to follow up on the Hep C issue. It kind of obviously feels like the company is getting a pretty sizeable benefit. But I am kind of curious have you looked at other therapeutic categories or has Dr. Miller identified any other therapeutic categories that could ultimately make sense to drive additional rebating opportunities. Some industry executives, we spoke to point to the PCSK9 on the cholesterol side is maybe being a big upcoming opportunity. So any comments there?","George Paz","The cost draw opportunity is big; we need to make sure we're at the forefront of that again. But that's looking forward, if you want to look in the rearview mirror this goes back well under our history, back in the 90s when many, many of our competitors were focused on driving the highest level of rebates in order to drive trend, we took the other approach. We drove generics, we saw the wave of generics in a patent exploration that were about to occur and saw the tremendous value.","It wasn't easy to convince clients that they should give up sizeable rebates to move into a generic in those days, but when they did the savings have gone from a $200 drug to a $30 drug work the rebate loss. And so that became our model, so we've been doing this our entire history and more recently we took on the cost on drugs and when low [indiscernible] went generic and made sure that we pushed [indiscernible] out front and I think we've just got a history of doing this, MS drugs, growth hormones, this isn't a one-off, this is the one that gets a notoriety.","Glen Santangelo","Maybe if I could just follow up, I have another question regarding your long-term growth rates. I think kind of given the disappointing selling season last year kind of says a lot that the company is able to grow double-digits next year but Tim kind of pointed out I think either the company is expecting maybe a little bit more normalized 94% to 97% retention in this selling season. So how should we think about those long-term growth rates the company laid out back in 2013.","Should we still think about those as being reasonable and valid and a normal selling season type year?","George Paz","So just couple of points here, very important. I am extremely pleased with the range we're getting when it's taken to consideration that we lost roughly 8% of our book to business, those are historic scripts that were out renewals and when they were at the high end of the EBITDA range cycle, they just came off, that's a big hole, we re-price them but they come in with new scripts. And so that's a challenge that's a real challenge for the year and to be able to grow through that, I think will speak as of testament to our business and what we've been able to accomplish.","As far as the longer term I'll turn over to Jim, he's our CFO.","Jim Havel","I agree with everything George has said, there is no question it was a strong year, but as the new CFO I got to tell you I am still getting my arms around the business and we've come off two outstanding years, if you consider 18%, 17% sequential annual growth, that's strong. And while we're happy with the 2015 guidance we're getting, you take a look and as I am often learning, I am often seeing the healthcare industry had some significant challenges and some could even say that it's broken.","We certainly got the tools to fix it is going to be an upward challenge, so as I say as we look forward we're committed to strong financial results and we're happy with our '15 guidance, but at this time I am just prepared to go beyond '15.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Garen Sarfian with Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Garen Sarfian","To get back to selling season. How would you describe the pricing dynamics this year? And in what ways is it changing versus prior years not just if it's rationale or not but maybe if you're now required to offer greater minimum service levels or any other metric.","Tim Wentworth","I would say that it's broadly very competitive as it has been every year I\u2019ve been in the business, and nothing unusual. As you imagine services is a focus, but that's how it's been the case as well frankly, so core service metrics is why we talk about them in terms of how we are and how we're better than our base line was prior to the merger are important to clients. And so delivering on those is important and we are and so we continue to see that. But I wouldn't see an increase in focus on that from what was already a very high level focus frankly. Perhaps the only other thing I would add is that you certainly have clients that as you're going through the rule of prospects frankly that are interested in modeling out scenarios where perhaps we manage things more aggressively and less aggressively and take a look at -- I\u2019ll use my words -- taking risk on ourselves as it relates to the effectiveness of our programs. And we frankly like that kind of conversation lot and frankly stimulate it quite often. So if you're looking at rebates for example in order to narrow formularies, if you\u2019re looking at specialty trend rates, if you're willing to allow us to manage your entire specialty population, those are the things that I\u2019ve seen sort of perhaps of the bit more focus to the selling season.","George Paz","One of the things that we hear a lot of obviously is our health plan in particular really focused on government regulation there the cost of Medicare compliance is not as significant. And I think we\u2019ve positioned ourselves top of the class, to really be there, to make sure that we are meeting their -- the needs of those clients and I think that\u2019s a real subtle -- pull those out of the [tax] if you will and position us well for opportunity.","Garen Sarfian","And then just if I can switch gears little bit for the fourth quarter, your generics accelerate declined this quarter, it was a modest downtick but it's historically been -- it's been a very stable metric that\u2019s really moved down, so could you just elaborate on what\u2019s going on there and maybe sort of how you're thinking about it in 2015?","George Paz","Historically it should trend up, there could be some because of seasonality at any given time there can be some small fluctuations, but I don\u2019t think the fourth quarter is any indication of long-term trend, that we still got some pretty powerful drugs over the next this coming year in \u201915 and \u201916 they are going to look generic that I\u2019ll continue to push that trend up, not down.","Tim Wentworth","If I may add to, certainly the generic tick was a slight tick in terms of the quarter, but you\u2019ll notice gross profit was up and there are so many drivers and so many different elements of the gross profit so they working in concert and we\u2019re very pleased with the way the fourth quarter came in and as I say as George said, I think that still the trends are going to be up on generics, but again I think that was a very small tick.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. George Hill with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","George Hill","I guess one of the things I want to start with is you tell us about cost impairment to your customers, it looks like the company\u2019s cost with respect to SG&A or expect to fall pretty sharply next year, I guess can you talk about where the company is looking in term costs?","George Paz","Sure, our SG&A is schedule to where we have it projected to come down next year and we feel as you pointed out it's a good reductions, its last development saw that as we get more comfortable and confident and our singular platform we\u2019re taking to look now at efficiencies and we\u2019re going to drive those efficiencies and standard operating procedures if you well through the organization. What we hope to see is certainly reduced headcount that goes along with that so we remain committed to response to our patients, but we do believe we can deal with less cost, we take a look at our facilities and we\u2019re certainly going to cut back where we can, we\u2019re going to cut back on certain areas of our spend, our IT is certainly gotten more stable in terms of preparing those platforms to be responsive to our patient.","So there is lots and lots of elements and really that SG&A goes across the company virtually every department has been challenged to say how can we do things very effectively, how can we do things efficiently and how can we get a result that\u2019s going to be compatible with our legacy of just being the low cost provider when it comes to SG&A per claim.","George Hill","Okay that\u2019s great color and maybe just a quick follow-up, but Tim you talk about 94% to 97% retention rate that actually seems like a low target given the amount of business that company has historically retain, I guess should we think of that as kind of the new normal and I guess longer-term do you feel like with same churn kind of take up or take down [PBF] space? Thanks.","Tim Wentworth","So I see it little bit differently, as we struggled last year with retention particularly frankly ex-medial accounts losing account teams and other things that were really strong, but if I looked at historical retention for both companies frankly particularly the range that we\u2019ve given would be where we would have seen it for as far our as possible, I would remind you that we have a strong small to mid-market business. For example, there is some natural churn in that so you start out with a little bit of retention probable risk before you ever really get to your name account renewals and so forth. So, our challenge and our job is to always make sure that we deliver value to clients, that we demonstrate that value to clients and that we don\u2019t buy business whether that would be renewal or new business in order to raise retention rates that levels quite frankly don\u2019t add value.","And so from my perspective, we think this range is a good range, is the range you should expect from us frankly and it does track with some of the best years I ever saw were between \u201997 and \u201998, so -- and those were years where quite frankly had an usual sorts of business up for grab. So, we feel little good about this range and delivering it and what it will do to our core business in terms of growth.","Operator","Next question comes from Mr. John Kreger with William Blair. Your line is now open.","John Kreger","Tim, maybe just add on to what you just said, if you think about that 94% to 97% retention goal, I think historically Expressed has generally not focused on early renewals as a way to get there, were as I think Medco has. Has as you're thinking about using that lever changed at all?","Tim Wentworth","Yes, what I would say that that is no, in a nutshell and I actually saw on our slide it says early renewal, let me be clear about that, that is not indicating early renewals, that\u2019s indicating early in the season normal renewals with 1\/1\/16 pricing being implemented where as we have a couple of mid-year of \u201915 but those were again on their normally scheduled contractual termination times. So I would say all this is an element that we consider in working with clients, particularly if the clients is willing to do something middle of the year, which many of them do we can share value in the middle of the year in a way it's responsible to our shareholders and helps our clients to reduce their cost. But the answer is no, we're not opening up the gates on that at all; we don't believe it's appropriate or necessary.","John Kreger","And one other question, I think in the past you guys have talked about kind of rebuilding your member interface for Mail. Where does that stand and as you're thinking from Mail penetration changing in '15 guidance?","Tim Wentworth","It is one of the things we're absolutely focused on across have company. We strongly believe as frankly a large part of our clients that mail in long-term is a terrific environment particularly with our clinical specialization. The outcomes that we're able to get and demonstrate are superior, it's a better patient experience and what we've needed to do as you say is really reengineer the frontend of our Mail experience and take a good hard look at it after couple years of integrating to our single platform.","We're manically focused on it, we use a lot of outside help as I said with some of you early in the process and we've now hired a leader and he's building a team to focus on it and all I'll say about this is there is reason that we hired brings a really strong member experience engineering bias to it, because this is an engineering challenge to really make a best in class insider healthcare experience for members as it relates to how they interface with us, get started on Mail specifically and if you happen to be a member, just keep watching the website, the digital assets that we have because you're going to see some very quick sort of evolutionary things that in the short-term will give us confidence that over the longer term we're going to grow Mail.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mr. Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Jones","Just a couple of follow ups here, Tim if I heard you correctly I believe you said that your clients could save about a $1 billion specifically from the actions related to Hepatitis C that you guys took. And historically as an organization you guys have pointed to kind of 10% to 15% of the savings accruing back to you guys. ","Just wondering given the dollar amount and the heavy focus on these types of expenses specialty drugs. Is that still the right way to think about the percent of savings you generate that you guys can keep?","George Paz","When you look at overall percentages of keep, those are a little bit out of context, because that builds, those are run rate numbers of our huge book of business and we\u2019ve had clients that our national formulary is obviously very focused on doing the right thing and getting the average drug down to savings for them was considerable, we gain money on that, savings were considerable. In other situations clients wanted to see both drugs on formulary, and then the savings would not have been as high and we get a different percentage.","We don't quite look at it, 15% here, 20% there some other peak, we look it overall what is the drug trends for the client, what do we try to accomplish? And then do we get our share of economics out of that. So whether we started working with the network whether started working with the drugs of formulary whether it's Mail components, or its clinical programs, each and every one of our account teams have goal, and goals are two pronged, one is to drive client trends the cost of our clients in right direction i.e. down from the trends that they would otherwise face into acceptable levels.","And then the second piece is we make sure we get rewarded for doing that work, and so it's not we say, we save this amount of money so here is our share of it. You have to go client by client and look at the $1 billion is for the year coming up. So if the year was just kicking off, we'll see how that unfolds, we'll see what other opportunities take place but I think this really does speak to our model and the fact that it works.","Tim Wentworth ","I would just add for example, to amplify George's point, one of the elements our clients who have work with us to narrow to accrual a benefiting, is the inflation cap. And so to the extent of those inflation which you can almost bet that there will be above what our clients have capped at, that different represents hard savings to them but you would necessary factor in to modeling in to us.","Operator","Our last question comes from Mr. Ross Muken with Evercore ISI. Your line is now open.","Unidentified Analyst","You talked a lot at the beginning about the improvements to the investments you made in the service levels and really seeing that transition well with a very strong 1\/1 start day, can you give a little, kind of quality of commentary of some of the service improvements you made just setting the stage for that service level that you expect to continue on a go forward basis for future 1\/1 starts.","Tim Wentworth ","The ones that really stick out things, PA; Prior Authorizations which called CRD and the Medicare. Those things are really a challenge and are very short-term on times, if it\u2019s say -- you got 24-72 hours available to turnaround a denial or acceptance. And when everybody fills them, most of them will get their first Scripts on January 1st, this is a huge challenge. Last year was a challenge for us, we got overwhelmed, clients that are trying to maintain cost put in more and more of these programs and was a tough year for us at start of the year, throughout the year we invested heavily and technology to make a better program for our employees to answer the need of the doctors and the patients and we saw huge improvement, massive improvement in this area this year. So the other side of that is almost all side, all specialty drug have a PA in front of them and so in order to get your -- these was very expensive life sustaining drug, on 1\/1 these patients are facing with this problem of having to go through a PA at the same time of trying to get their treatment, same time their battling weather and what whatever else that might be in front of them.","And so that\u2019s always a challenging time and we invested heavily and bringing our prior authorization area and our specialty areas together to what more closely in order to smooth this process and we have much better service levels in our specialty pharmacy area. This is two simple examples, we can go on for a long time, but these are investments we\u2019ve made which I think will sustain us well into the future and keep us on the right path to meet all the requirements under Medicare\u2019s Medicaid and our clients\u2019 needs involved in helping our patients. So that some examples.","George Paz","Well thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to seeing you tonight in St. Louis and look forward to really strong Investor Day program tomorrow. So, see you all soon. Bye, bye.","Operator","Thank you for joining.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. With that being said, I'll turn the conference now over to the Vice President of Investor Relations, Mr. David Myers. Please go ahead, sir.","David Myers","Thank you, and good morning, everyone. With me today are George Paz, Chairman and CEO; and Jeff Hall, our CFO.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in our filing with the SEC. For clarity purposes, all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables in our press release for reconciliation of GAAP to adjusted numbers we will be discussing. The reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our earnings release. The release is posted on our website.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Jeff, who'll discuss our third quarter financial results.","Jeffrey L. Hall","Thanks, David. Our third quarter results continue to trend a strong operating and financial performance. In keeping with our model of alignment, the increase in generic fill rate resulted in significant savings to our clients, and our gross profit margin was up 30 basis points sequentially. Integration, including the migration of lives to our destination platform, continues successfully. Synergies continue to be accelerated into 2012, which contributed to strong earnings for the quarter and the increase in our guidance range. Cash flows were strong, and we made good progress towards realizing our cash flow synergy and delevering our balance sheet.","We reported third quarter earnings per share of $1.02, up 29% from the same quarter last year. Home delivery and specialty claims were $39.8 million, up 199% from the same quarter last year. On a pro forma basis for the acquisition, organic or same-store equivalent home delivery claims would have grown approximately 3% over last year.","SG&A expenses declined $94 million sequentially from the second quarter as a result of the accelerated realization of synergies. We expect SG&A to increase in the fourth quarter, reflecting normal seasonal expenses and preparation for one-one implementations. EBITDA was $1.6 billion, up 136% from last year, while EBITDA per adjusted script was up 9%.","During the quarter, we repaid $1.1 billion of debt, which included Medco's $600 million accounts receivable financing facility which we have terminated, continuing our plan to quickly delever. We now expect EPS for the year, including deal-related cost and amortization and other nonrecurring items, to be in the range of $3.65 to $3.75, representing growth of 25% over 2011 at the midpoint, an increase of $0.19 from our original midpoint as a result of the acceleration of synergy. This range now assumes a 39% tax rate, which is an increase from our previous guidance, which assumed a 39% rate. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter is expected to be 39%.","And at this point, I'll turn the call over to George.","George Paz","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We remain confident that we are well-positioned for growth and remain bullish on the PBM business. Although we are not prepared to provide 2013 guidance this morning, I will provide more clarity into our future outlook. There are a number of positives that will provide tailwinds for our business. The integration of Medco remains on track, and we are meeting or exceeding our key targets.","Last week, we successfully migrated our fourth tier of clients to our destination platform and have made considerable progress in rationalizing our operational footprint. As a result, certain synergies originally expected in 2013 were realized in 2012. This is contributing to a strong 2012 results. This acceleration of synergies reduces the incremental synergies in 2013.","Our pipeline of products is resonating in the marketplace. Clients have a thirst to better manage cost, and they appreciate the science behind our evidence-based approach to managing the pharmacy benefit. We will help clients and members navigate the complexity of Health Care Reform, and we will enhance our leading position in management of the cost and quality of care for specialty medications.","Our cash flows remain strong, and our timing for expected realization of cash flow synergies is accelerating. Notwithstanding these recent successes, the economic environmental outlook is presenting some near-term challenges. Over the last few weeks, as part of our forecasting process, we spoke to many of our health claim clients and large employer clients. What we learned is that our clients have unprecedented concerns about our country's economic outlook. This lackluster economy is taking its toll in several areas. In aggregate, our health claim clients are expecting membership reductions in 2013. Large employers have pulled back on hiring plans, using contractors and part-time employees when necessary. Mid- to small employers are cutting back or postponing health care coverage decisions while waiting for more clarity on Health Care Reform. And we continue to see low rates of drug utilization as individuals deal with uncertainty at the household level.","As a result, the current weak business climate and the unemployment outlook will likely result in significant in-group member attrition in 2013, continued low utilization rates and increased client demands and expectations. We had a successful sales season, adding approximately 215 new accounts, which exceeded our sales targets. We operate in a very competitive environment, but we remain disciplined in our approach to pricing and profitability. We project that our retention rate will be approximately 94%. In addition, the transition of the UnitedHealth book of business to OptumRx throughout 2013 will reduce claim comparisons in 2013 versus 2012 and 2014 versus 2013. The adjusted Rx reduction will result in diseconomies of scale until the book is fully transitioned.","In spite of these near-term headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment, we expect to grow earnings per share and EBITDA in 2013. In fact, we expect to grow gross profit per adjusted Rx in the high-single-digit range and EBITDA per adjusted Rx in the mid-teens next year. However, with the acceleration of synergies in '12, which translates into lower incremental synergies in '13, along with lower volume expectations, we view current consensus estimates for '13 as overly aggressive.","In early January, we'll receive the actual enrollment data from all of our clients and see initial Rx volume. This will provide more clarity to our expected financial performance. Therefore, on a go-forward basis, we will provide annual guidance when we release our year-end financial results. As such, we will give our 2013 guidance in February. Express Scripts will continue to develop and offer innovative solutions that will protect American families from the rising cost of health care. We have an unprecedented opportunity to help make the use of prescription drugs safer and more affordable for tens of millions Americans.  That will translate into strong value for our clients and patients and continued growth for our stockholders.","At this point, operator, we'll be happy to answer any questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard Capital Markets.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","George, I just wanted to follow up on your comments there. Relative to having spoken to some of your clients in recent weeks and their concerns about the economy, can you sort of compare and contrast where they stand right now looking at '13 compared to maybe where they stood a year ago as we were looking at '12? Just trying to understand this persistently weak economy that we've had, the extent to which maybe your perception is just getting worse versus it continues to just be lackluster, I think, in your words. And are you seeing a concentration of membership or lack thereof in certain clients or certain types of clients?","George Paz","So, no one size fits all, of course. And what we're seeing, and you see it every day in the Wall Street Journal.  Yesterday, there was a headline article about how employers are looking at the impact of Health Care Reform and what actions they may take. There's articles in today's papers, there was -- this is a constant theme. And I believe employers are concerned about the economic outlook. And it was tough going through '09 and '10. Employers had to make very difficult decisions about workforce levels. And nobody enjoys doing layoffs. It's something that has to be done to protect the shareholder base and something to be done to protect the rest of the employees and to stay profitable. But having gone through that, people don't like -- CEOs don't really like doing that. And so companies have been very slow to bring back employment. We saw that throughout last year's numbers as well. The difference is we had significant Medco synergies that accelerated in the years that helped offset a lot of the attrition that we saw throughout the course of the year. Employers, when you see the unemployment numbers that are coming out of the federal numbers when they're released, people are hiring. But that doesn't mean they're necessarily hiring people and giving them benefit coverage. A lot of employers are hiring part-time workers, people that keeps throwing hours [ph] to below 30%. Other employers are hiring contractors and using contractors to do the work. Some of the jobs, unfortunately, are going offshore. And so we're seeing those trends existing in our marketplace. I would tell you it's worse today, at least the outlook is. Now the reason we're not going to give you a hard number is nobody really knows, right? There's still a month to go, 2 months to go before the end of the year. We don't know exactly what's going to happen. I don't want to throw a number out there based on some numbers that are coming into us and not be accurate when in 2 short months, we're going to have a very strong number. On January 1, actually it's before then, we'll get the enrollment files from all of our clients. Every one of them sends in a new enrollment file. They do it constantly, but, of course, we'll get the January 1 numbers, which will be the starting point for next year. Those stayed pretty consistent through the course of the year. And we'll know where we stand. We'll know what the success of our health plan selling seasons are. We'll know the success of the retention endeavors. We'll see where the numbers are at. And we'll be prepared in February to give accurate guidance, which is much better than we could do today.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe just as a follow-up, just to make sure we understand, your absolute or specific numbers aside, when you're alluding to '13 being overly aggressive, is it sort of based on new things that you're finding recently, or is it that maybe -- is it The Street has meandered further afar from where you've been thinking? And maybe the volume issues you're talking about or the synergy acceleration making for a little harder comp next year are some of the places that were off? So have your thoughts actually changed, or is it that you're sort of reining in The Street versus where they've gone?","George Paz","Well, let's go back to last quarter. We had a strong second quarter earning. Through the course of the last couple of months, consensus estimates on earnings have continued to go up without really a catalyst from us. We gave earnings guidance. We didn't have a forum for which to discuss, as you know, because of FD, if somebody takes up their guidance, we just can't call them up and say what are you doing? That's against the law. So we have to have a forum by which to address this issue. We're not prepared to actually say what next year's earnings are going to be. But what we are prepared to say is that this continued tick-up, as we look at an uncertain economy and the numbers, what we see confronting us doesn't feel warranted. And therefore, we felt this was the right forum to address that issue. And that's what we're doing on this call, is addressing the issue we believe that the numbers have gotten ahead of themselves.","Operator","The next question is from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","George, can you help us to quantify any of the things that you talked about?  For example, the synergy pull-through from '13 into '12 would be one. And then, secondly, when you talk about acceleration in gross profit per script, is that because of the makeup of your scripts as you lose some of the lower profitable United Scripts, or are you saying your underlying book is still going to have nice high-single-digit growth in gross profit per script?","George Paz","Yes, that's a good question. I'll do my best here.  Again, I'm not providing earnings guidance. So I just want to make sure we're clear on that. But from an overall perspective, addressing the second half first, yes, we're continuing to pull in our synergies. And we are still working with our clients in order to promote mail, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, that mail year-over-year is up 3% on an equivalent basis. And we're continuing to sell our clinical programs. These things are all driving down the cost of health care for our plans and our members and increasing profitability for us. Those trends will continue into the next year. And our belief is that we will grow gross margin and EBITDA per script. Obviously, gross margin grows because of getting more pull-through in our client base, better pull-through in our client base of our programs and generics and mail and all those type things. And on the other side of the coin, EBITDA per script will continue to grow because of reductions in our cost structures. And that's including some diseconomies of scale that are occurring with respect to the UnitedHealth business going off. So even with those diseconomies, we believe we can grow EBITDA per script in the mid-teens. As far as -- what was the first part of your question again?","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","On the synergies, I mean, I know you don't want to talk about specific numbers, but can you help us even directionally, George, how to think about -- and maybe in a percentage, or you expected some component in '13, and what was pulled through to '12?","George Paz","Sure. Yes, as you know, we've taken up guidance quite a bit in '12. That's the result of mostly of the synergy pull-through that's occurring. The tax rate's gone up, and we're still exceeding our numbers. So that takes additional synergies to make that happen as well. So the synergy pull-through has been good. Where it gets tough, and I think Jeff made this point after we closed the NextRx acquisition, is there's an Express Scripts run rate number, there's a Medco run rate number, and then we believe we can take each of those and get a synergy out of it. But when you actually start putting the books together -- last week on November 1, we moved our largest tier ever of clients. Thousands and thousands of daily prescriptions were moved into the new platform. Then when we do that, we come up with the best rebate programs, the best network opportunities, and we start the pull-through. We, at the same time, our supply chain people are out trying to negotiate better discounts on both the network pharmacy prices as well as the rebates. Those are coming together. How much of that is synergy versus what we would have already got, that becomes very difficult. The ability to say what would have  Express Scripts grown on a standalone basis versus how much is synergy, every day we move away from closing becomes more and more clouded. We feel very good of where we're at. But let me just say it another way. If we would go back to the 3% trends that we would have realized before the economy has slowed down, that actually now we're in a negative trend this year, utilization trend, and we would have realized -- so therefore, our groups would have grown, they would have been adding more lives. This may be a whole different conversation. But that's not the world we live in. The world we live in is people are taking less medications this year than they took last year, and our membership and our plans aren't growing. That's what's causing the issue. This is a volume issue, not a earnings per Rx issue.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And George, just as a follow on that, can you just help the market, though, to understand -- I mean, what we're consistently hearing from investors that they're concerned about is that this is a price issue, that as you went out and you renewed business and one business that -- the concern going into 2014 is that it's a much more competitive PBM market. Can you give us your insights as to what you think on the pricing side and what customers are looking for? Because there's this concern that when you talk about customers' expectations increasing that that's just a code word for they want more at the price.","George Paz","Well, we deal with large employers and medium-sized employers and health clients, and I will tell you, I remember my first earnings call in 1998 at Express Scripts, one of the big issues we faced was pricing pressure and the competitiveness of the PBM industry. I'll tell you, it's -- what is it, 16, 14, 15 years later?  That hasn't changed. This is a very competitive marketplace. We deal with very sophisticated clients, and they want a bigger piece of the pie. Our job, as I've said over the -- since I was CFO, is our job is to balance that delivery of value to them with the prices we need to stay competitive. I believe we have many tools in order to help drive down their cost, from Consumerology to the TRCs to the clinical programs we're running, that allow us to meet the needs of our clients and maintain our price. I would tell you, Lisa, pricing is incredibly competitive, but at the same time, we can offset that. Otherwise, EBITDA per script would not be rising.  It would be declining. And so it's not that this is an easy walk, it's just that we have a lot of tools and opportunities to help control that. And I still believe that we have the best offering out there. And the consultant's job is to try to get us all within a range, and then we try to sell. Like I've said for years, we never want to be the best price in any deal, and I think we've maintained that stance.","Operator","Our next question is from Glen Santangelo with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on the previous comments you just made regarding a negative utilization trend this year. It seemed to suggest that we're seeing continued deterioration throughout the year, but yet if you look at the industry data per IMS and other sources, it would suggest that the script volume is actually going in the other direction, is actually accelerating as the year goes on. I'm just trying to reconcile maybe what you're seeing within your customer base versus maybe what industry data seems to suggest.","George Paz","Well, we've had this conversation over the last quite a few years. I've never been able to quite understand IMS' data. It never lines up well with our data. All I can tell you, Glen, is what I see in our numbers, and we see utilization trends decline. And we represent a pretty big piece of the puzzle here. And it's clearly happening. And that's notwithstanding all of the things we're trying to do to make sure that our diabetic and our hypertensive and our cholesterol clients and patients continue on their disease state regimens. But you know, it's -- I'm just reporting what we're seeing.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So maybe if I could just follow up on the revenue issue, because it's clearly suggesting that maybe the revenue expectations out there are a little bit too high. And you said 2 things that I want to follow up with. First is UNH. It kind of sounds like UNH is rolling off in fiscal '13 and fiscal '14. Could you help us think about the timing of when we should start to think about those claims coming out of the top line?","George Paz","Well, they come off throughout '13, which means that when you compare '13 to '12, they're roughly 50%, it's not quite that number. But just assume 50% of the claims are going to be out during '13, which means when you get to '14, they're all gone. But then you still have 50% in for '13. So you got to bridge it down.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay, that's clear. The retention rate, I think you said, was 94%. So as I think about sort of building that model in 2013, I know you don't want to give guidance, but based on your retention rate comments, are we starting fiscal '13 -- I think you measure retention rates based on claims volumes, so are we starting fiscal '13 6% in the whole on claims volumes?","George Paz","There's a lot that goes into that. That's a factor into it, you got to bring in the new sales wins that are going to add back to it, then you got to reduce it by negative utilization, if that persists. And then you have to figure out what all the other clients' attrition rates are going to be. That's why we're not giving guidance right now.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then my last question, and I promise I'll jump off, is UNH. As it rolls off, you seem to suggest that maybe there's going to be a little bit of diseconomies of scale. And when we traditionally thought about UNH, it had very little mail volume, I thought. And so as these retail claims run off, I'm just trying to understand that diseconomies of scale comment as I think about sort of where our gross margins or the impact it could have on gross margins over the next 12 months.","George Paz","We have an obligation to the patients that are served by United in those plans to make sure that they have quality service. And just because they're rolling off the book, we still had to have the clinical support to provide all these therapy programs and all the other programs that they're offering, PAs and on and on and on. They do have some mail, not a lot, but they do have mail volumes. And so we've got to -- we intend to support all that. And so you can't let people go. There's a lot of account managers that service their accounts. And until they're transitioned away, we can't reduce that account management field force. So there's a lot of costs, a fair amount of cost, that are attributed to the account that can't go away, or they can step down, but we can't step it down until after we hit certain intervals of business reductions that causes diseconomies of scale to occur.","Operator","Our next question is from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","George, you have about $1 billion on the balance sheet, probably up to another $1 billion coming in the fourth quarter, if not more. How much do you need to run the company? What kind of deleveraging should we expect in the fourth quarter, and when do share repurchases make sense?","George Paz","That's -- Bob, I've always tried to be a good steward of our balance sheet. I would really prefer to answer that when we come out with our 2013 guidance. Obviously, we're going to look at both the proper levels of debt, the right -- I'm a big fan of leverage. So we want to keep the right level of leverage on our balance sheet, but at the same time -- and enter into the right stock buyback programs. But I'm not really prepared to do that until we see how the year is rolling out and provide all of that at one time. I don't want a piecemeal guidance, here.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","What would you have us focus on as a catalyst ahead of the first quarter earnings report for next year that really will be the real sense on what you can earn for 2013? If you're not in that market buying stock or deleveraging aggressively, I'm not sure why we need to own the stock near-term.","George Paz","I think because we're a quality company that's providing tremendous value to our shareholders. And when you -- what I'm telling you is that the stock ran up, we felt that the obligation to tell people that it was aggressive. And there's a lot of catalyst that still can occur. I don't know what the economy is going to look like over the next 2 months. Today's a big day. And we'll see how all those plays out and where it leads and how does consumer confidence come back. I can't give you a whole lot more than that, Bob. It's -- that's where we're headed.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","I guess -- are you surprised at the reaction to the stock today? Unfortunately, your comments haven't done much to help it over the course of the call. It actually trended down. Is down $10 a fair assessment of your opportunities going forward?","George Paz","I think our stock is tremendously undervalued.","Operator","And next, go to Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I just want to circle back on the pricing comments. I understand and appreciate that you operate in an environment where every year, pricing is always challenged as clients look for more savings. But I guess just sort of if you could spend a little bit more time there, because it seems to be a big concern. I mean, are you saying that the pricing environment today or as you look into '13 is incrementally worse than the trends that you've seen over the last several years, or is it really more just kind of a continuation of what goes on in the PBM industry?","George Paz","It's a continuation of what goes on in the industry. And what happens is if you can't -- if as a PBM, your account management team and clinicians can't present to the client new ideas to confront their issues -- say they all of a sudden, they get some -- they hire some people or somebody comes down with a severe illness, and health care costs are jumping on them going up, our job is to try to help them navigate that, to come up with the best solutions. If they don't feel we're able to offer that, one of 2 things happen. Either the price discussion gets tremendously more complex, difficult, or they leave because somebody else is offering them something better. Our job is to continue to look at new opportunities, new products and new ways to manage those costs. I think we've gotten better at that. And that's why I said and I continue to say that earnings per -- or gross margin per adjusted Rx as well as EBITDA per adjusted Rx, will go up next year because I believe we are focused on doing the right  things and providing value to our patients and value to our clients. As I said a few minutes ago, this is a volume game, not a price game.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","No, and I guess just try to piece together some of the comments on the call this morning around -- on the cash position and, obviously, the stock, your view of the stock being significantly undervalued, I guess would you guys consider straying from your 2x debt to EBITDA kind of benchmark that you'd put out there as far as deploying capital towards share repurchases?  Or is that a pretty hard and fast metric that you're going to hold to?","George Paz","I think everything's on the table.","Operator",".","And next, go to Bret Jones with Oppenheimer.","Bret D. Jones - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I want to circle back on the comments about United and the diseconomies of scale. I was wondering if there's any way to kind of quantify what kind of impact there could be. We realize that you do have an obligation to provide clinical support, but United Scripts were also relatively low-profitability scripts. Is there any way to get our heads around what kind of impact that could have as that business rolls off, if you're losing low-profitability scripts versus the amount of cost you'll have to retain to service the customer?","George Paz","Well, let's put things in perspective. Profitability or profit gross margin per script is almost irrelevant when it comes to diseconomies of scale. There's a cost structure that has to support that business. And so we have lots of people that work on that account. Whether you're taking off $0.05 scripts or you're taking off $5 scripts, you still have a cost structure. And so what's occurring is your spreading more and more of those costs against less and less of those scripts, no matter what the gross margin is. And therefore, you're having diseconomies of scale as those scripts run off. Until we're in a position to be able to redeploy all those people in either other jobs or, unfortunately, take them out, we are not going to realize the cost reductions and locks up with a run off of the revenues. That's just -- that's the way the business works.","Bret D. Jones - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And so if we just think about that for 2013, is it possible to offset -- is it your position you'll be able to offset it?  Or do you think it will be a drag next year?","George Paz","It will be a drag in '13. And then in '14, we have to turn a lot of things off in the first quarter, which will be a bit of a drag. And then based on probably sometime in the second quarter of '14, again, that's depending if everything stays on target. We don't control this one. So we're providing all the help we can to United to move these individuals, these plans over to OptumRx. But if they fall behind or they don't meet their schedule, then -- if it doesn't finish up by 1\/1\/14, we have a different answer. But assuming it is all done on 1\/1\/14, by the second quarter of '14, we should be rightsized and all the expenses out.","Operator","Our next question is from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","We're hearing the clients are increasingly looking to move to the lower-cost options, you've talked about it in the past, such as mail and narrow networks. Back in 2011, I think you thought the economy would weigh on mail [ph] penetration. With what you know today, what are your thoughts on mail penetration for next year?","George Paz","Well, I still think it's a very strong program that helps clients' plans meet their needs. So the clients are still, as Jeff said in his prepared comments, mail is up 3% in this tough economy. We're going through that process of understanding what the clients are going to accept for plan designs that's still under works, and we'll give that guidance when we release 2013 guidance in February. The same thing with narrow networks. That's a very good opportunity for clients to reduce costs by eliminating the network access, and more and more clients are in that program. And so, again, in -- when we release guidance, we'll provide some insights.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then I know that you don't talk about specific customers, but we've been hearing from some other DoD suppliers that they are now seeing lower demand levels out of the DoD. You talked initially on uncertainty around budget. Given the risk of sequestration and the potential defense cuts, are the DoD employment levels reflected in your thinking on covered lives for next year?","George Paz","Yes. DoD is -- we are not seeing lower demand in that book of business. That's our -- that's a whole different program than an employer-based program. Sequestration, by the way, we want to be partners with the Department of Defense if they're faced that issue. And I think there's some great things we can do to help them reduce their costs, and we're meeting with them regularly, and it's a great client for us. We enjoy our relationship with them, and we're all proud to serve our men and women in uniform.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Okay. And then lastly, and, again, I know that you're not talking about growth rates, but from what I'm hearing on this call and your comments on United and kind of like some deleveraging in '13 and then higher profitability starting in 2Q '14, as we think about the future and adjust our models, should we just think about smoother earnings growth for Express over the next couple of years rather than kind of like the spike that we've been modeling and then more of a slowdown? Is that the right way for us to think about the trajectory for the next 2 to 3 years?","George Paz","Well, Ricky, I can't speak -- we're not even giving '13 guidance, so I can't, certainly can't speak to '14 or '15. We'll take those on as we get closer to those timeframes. Again, I don't -- what I said was there was diseconomies of scale that we're going to incur with respect of the United book of business. I didn't discuss profitability in '14. It's just that there was diseconomies of scale that would come out of the business in the second quarter of '14. So -- and again, that's all dependent upon the United transition of those lives, so we'll have to see how that plays out.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Valiquette with UBS.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So just -- and I mean this kind of in the friendly way, But just, I guess, some of your large competitors today are suggesting that they're not really seeing or expecting any in-group member attrition in their books of business for 2013. So I guess thinking about just trying to figure out maybe if there's something unique about your book of business, where maybe your large employer base may witness more employee attrition maybe than what other PBMs might be witnessing. Is there any angle on that, I mean maybe WellPoint versus non-WellPoint, or just any comment that might help clarify some of that and why maybe you're seeing that but the other PBMs are not.","George Paz","Well, we've got 100 million Americans as our client base. We have 3,600 clients. So I think we've got a pretty good cross-section of America here. We have very large health plans and very small health plans. We're in every state of the union with clients, so I think we're pretty diverse when it comes to the book of business. I'm just telling what we're seeing. The way the process works is we don't do these things in a vacuum, we've been doing it for a lot of years. So when we go to do our budgets for the following year, we reach out to our clients. We don't know how their sales seasons are going, and we don't know when they sell, whether they're selling an integrated life on the health plan side or they're selling PBM or non-PBM lives. And so we got to capture all that data in order to roll up our numbers into our annual forecast and what we're going to do. When you look at the numbers that are coming up to us, that's what we're seeing. We're seeing our plans are saying that they expect attrition. And we're not in a position to second-guess that. And we're running with those numbers. We're going to work with them, but again all this becomes clear in January, and we'll be in a position to provide clarity in January when we actually get our enrollment figures.","Steven Valiquette - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful. Just one real quick follow-up. Is there anything restricting you on doing share buybacks right now if you wanted to, either on debt covenants or some other factor? I know you're not guiding that, but just is there anything restricting you if you wanted to, theoretically?","George Paz","No. Obviously, we'd work hand in glove with the rating agencies to make sure we protect our bondholders and do what's right for all of our stakeholders.","Operator","And we'll go to Charles Rhyee with Cowen and Company.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Maybe looking at just 2012, if I recall, you guys were assuming a big step-up in the share count, and it seems like the share count itself as we think about next year could have a big swing on what earnings is. Jeff or George, can you give just an update what you're expecting here for end of year share count?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Yes, we're still expecting 750. We haven't moved off of that. Obviously, that means there's going to have to be a pickup here in the fourth quarter. But that's still our best estimate.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","And then that pick up...","Jeffrey L. Hall","And then obviously that means that, I mean, that 750 for the year, it's because the first quarter was low. So obviously, there is a big pickup in share count into '13, because we don't have a first quarter without Medco averaged in again.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Right. The assumption is that, if I recall correctly, remind us what the assumption into why the step-up. Is that we're assuming that the Medco grants all get exercised here as we get into the fourth quarter?","Jeffrey L. Hall","We have a lot of legacy Medco employees that have a lot of share-based comp that has the ability to be exercised. And it's hard for us to estimate when they're actually going to exercise those shares, and they going to our fully diluted count.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen and Company, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just lastly, obviously you're not -- I understand you're not giving guidance, but the commentary that you gave is more or less told you what the top end of the range won't be. Can you give us a sense, and I know people have kind of asked it in a couple of different ways, is there any sort of way to talk about what the absolute bottom end might be so that we can at least think about, qualitatively, about next year?","Jeffrey L. Hall","The only thing we've said at this point is that we expect EPS and EBITDA to be up year-over-year. And when we say up, we mean pro forma for the acquisition.","Operator","Our next question is from Ross Muken with ISI.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess as you think about sort of the unemployment environment in the U.S., I know we've sort of beat this over the head. But I guess, when we look at our data, it seems like the environment's improving, and so, I guess, what is there in terms of the election tonight that you're also looking for, whether it's reform-based or other that also can influence sort of that assumption on what kind of utilization could look like for next year and into '14?","George Paz","Well, let's make sure we're clear here. We're not giving guidance. What we're saying is what our clients are telling us their thoughts are. And so if, in fact, our clients -- our health plans stay stable on employment; if, in fact, our employer groups hire more people because they get optimistic about the Christmas season and the holiday season and then next year, there could be a significant upside. I'm not saying that this is all a doom-and-gloom story. I'm just telling you based on what we've heard from our client base is what we thought, that we think that the numbers out there are overly aggressive. When you look at employment data and you see employment trends, you've got to go deeper than just what the employment rate is. As you know, you got to understand whether or not those jobs that are being added to the economy are actually getting provided health care coverage. And if they're not being provided health care coverage, then that's -- the small employer number, as you know, that get added into the annual employment number as a monthly employment numbers is a guesstimate. And that's why they always true it up a month later, because they take a set number and they add it to the best guess, because there's no way to get those numbers from small employers. They true it up a month later, and you come out with a number. Well, small employers aren't necessarily having health care coverage right now. They're waiting to see what's happening. So as the economy starts to heat up and the small employer jobs start to be created and the economy starts to grow, the question is, will they add employment?  And the second question is in 2014, all these people are going to get covered. So in '14, we're going to see all the people that don't have coverage today or that are being put on the sidelines without coverage will have access to coverage. All those people will know their roles, I don't know if that's 30 million, 40 million or 50 million by then, but it's going to be some number. And that's an opportunity for us. That's an opportunity to work with our health plans to go get those people and provide the coverage. All we're saying is that the roll-off of our client base is more pessimistic. And we don't know -- and what we will do is once we get the employment numbers in, once we get enrollment numbers in, in January, we'll refine it, we'll work with it, we'll see all of January's results. So we'll know what script counts are through the month of January. And I think we'll be in pretty good position to give pretty accurate guidance in February of 2013. And I hope like crazy that the economy is really strong. I'm a big patriot, and I love this country, and there's nothing more than I would like to see than strong employment trends, people adding people to the ranks and our health plans all growing. That will be amazing. And let's keep our fingers crossed that that's what we're reporting on in February.","Ross Muken - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","I guess my point being, do you think that there's any read-through from the health plans, the kind of the uncertainty over the exchanges and sort of reform? And obviously, without knowing who the president is going to be, it's tough to know kind of the trajectory there. So do you think some of that could explain maybe some of the pessimism of the client base on why they may not be as bullish on sort of enrollment and utilization?","George Paz","Absolutely. No question. But the problem is, Ross, I'm not in a position to second-guess that, either.","Operator","And we'll go to Ann Hynes with Mizuho Securities.","Ann K. Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","I want to go back to, I think it was Lisa's question, you were talking about synergies and it's difficult to break out. I guess I really don't understand that. And the reason I'm bringing it up, is when I look at consensus EBITDA estimates, they're really high, and they're really all over the place. And I have a feeling that people are putting a same-store EBITDA growth on your business and then adding what they think the synergies are and x-ing out UNH. So I guess my question is, I know maybe you don't want to break out what the synergy number is versus what real same-store EBITDA growth was in the quarter, but directionally, can you give us what you think the PBM business is growing on a same-store basis? Is it growing mid-single-digits, is it going high single-digits, is it growing low double-digits? Because I think that would reduce some of the overestimates out there, especially with EBITDA.","George Paz","The question isn't -- or the issue isn't whether we're willing to give EBITDA numbers. What I was trying to say was let's assume, let's just make up simple numbers. Let's say Express Scripts had rebates per script of $1, and Medco has rebates per script of $1.10. One very simple synergy is to move all of the Express Scripts members into the Medco formularies, provided their plans will allow you to do that. And if they do, then you would end up at $1.10 or $0.10 a script on the Express Scripts numbers. That would, in my mind, would be considered a synergy. Now in addition to that, brand prices go up 10% a year. So it's Chris Houston's job and her team that work in our supply chain to go out and try to capture that 10% growth as an increase in our rebate numbers. When you have a drug that's the exclusive in a class, that's a very difficult thing to do. When you have 3 or 4 competing drugs in a class, it's much more easier to do. And so it's a question of how much of that price increase can we gain back for our clients and for our shareholders?  The synergy calculation becomes mixed, because what ends up happening is as we move the 2 plans together, we go into one platform, one rebate -- one formulary calculation of what the rebates are, and when we do that, then -- so if we had $1, $1.10 and next year it's $1.12, how much of that synergy and how much of that is in-group growth [ph]?  You really can't determine that any longer, because all the numbers are getting co-mingled. That's the only point we're trying to make, is that we go in with where we think we should be, we put that out in specific targets to our members, and as long as we're achieving those targets and we're hitting our in-group growth off our base business as well as our synergy targets and we monitor that.  We're not in a position to give that information out.","Ann K. Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","All right. Okay. And what about -- did you talk about -- I know you said you had 94% retention rate. Did you talk about just renewal pricing for 2013, what does that look like, maybe for the Express Scripts book of business versus the Medco book of business?","George Paz","I don't know that there was much difference. I mean, our clients are very synonymous so -- or homogeneous, I should say. We both have clients in a large employer group and the health plan group. I think what our teams try to do is that there were certain things that Express Scripts did better than Medco and vice versa. So they're looking for upon renewal is because of the cost of inflation and all the other pieces and the rising cost of health care, they look at the prices to come down. And the question is how do you meet those cost reductions that they're looking for?  If you don't have any tools, it comes out of your pocket. If we can offer better formulary decisions, better clinical programs, better options, then it doesn't have to come out of our pocket and we still achieve the desired results that they need. And that's our job. And that's mixed across the entire book. Again, it's a competitive environment, but I don't -- we feel good about where we sit. And the fact that gross margin for scripts can go up next year should speak to the pricing environment, in my mind.","Ann K. Hynes - Mizuho Securities USA Inc., Research Division","All right. And just going back to the EBITDA question. I mean, you do think your base business is growing despite the Medco benefit and despite the synergies you get. Can you just -- I mean, just getting back to people's concern about pricing, just does PBM business continues to grow? I think that's what people want to know.","George Paz","Yes, I would say it is growing.","Well, thank you all very much. I appreciate your time this morning, and we look forward to keeping you posted and look forward to providing you more clarity around 2013 in February. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"8573":["Express Scripts Holding Co.

We are proud of our 2015 performance and we are confident in our 2016 guidance. This morning, Eric will discuss our financial results and future outlook, Tim will give highlights from our strong operational performance, and I will follow with my perspective on why Express Scripts is the best choice for patients, clients and shareholders.","I'll now turn over to Eric to discuss the strong results that our business model delivered in 2015 and what we expect to achieve in 2016.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thanks, George, and good morning everyone. This morning, I'm happy to report strong fourth quarter earnings and an overall financial performance that delivered adjusted earnings per share of $1.56, representing growth of 12% over last year. We adjudicated 341.5 million adjusted claims generating adjusted EBITDA of $1.9 billion, up 4%, which results in adjusted EBITDA per claim of $5.66. As expected, we generated $2.9 billion of cash flow during the quarter.","We also delivered solid financial results for the full year 2015, generating $5.53 of adjusted earnings per share, which represents growth of 13%. We adjudicated approximately 1.3 billion of adjusted claims. We delivered adjusted EBITDA of $7.05 billion, matching the midpoint of our guidance range. Our adjusted EBITDA per claim was at $5.43, which represents 5% growth.","Full-year cash flow from operations was $4.85 billion. We deployed $8.9 billion of cash during 2015, $5.5 billion to repurchase common stock under the 2015 accelerated share repurchase agreement and $3.4 billion to retire debt. As anticipated when we provided our 2016 guidance in December, we settled the 2015 accelerated share repurchase agreement in January and received 9.1 million additional shares, resulting in a total of 64.2 million shares received under the agreement.","Due to our strong outlook for the year, we are raising the lower end of our 2016 guidance from $6.08 to $6.10 and now expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $6.10 to $6.28, representing growth of 10% to 14%.","Despite the effects of the Coventry and Catamaran business rolling off, which represent approximately 3% of claims, we expect EBITDA for 2016 to be in the range of $7.2 billion to $7.4 billion, or an increase of 3% to 5%. We also expect to generate $4.6 billion to $5.1 billion of cash flow from operations.","As a management team, we are focused on improving healthcare outcomes for our patients while reducing costs. We are driven to create efficiencies across the organization. For example, working hand in hand with Chris Houston, who leads our core operations, we are simplifying operating complexities, eliminating redundancies and reducing our cost to fill. We are focused on a common goal to reduce costs within the organization while enhancing the service we provide to our patients and clients.","From an investment perspective, our priorities remain the same: invest in our core business, pursue strategic opportunities, and return value to shareholders. Our capital structure strategy for 2016 remains consistent with prior years. We expect to maintain a long-term leverage target of 2 times debt-to-EBITDA. Once our strategic investment priorities are met, we expect to return the majority of our free cash flow to shareholders through share repurchases.","With respect to the first quarter 2016, we expect adjusted earnings per diluted share to be in the range of $1.18 to $1.22. Consistent with historical trends, our first quarter earnings are expected to decline sequentially from the fourth quarter but represent year-over-year growth from the first quarter 2015 of 7% to 11%.","I will now turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Thanks, Eric. As George mentioned and as Eric reinforced, Express Scripts is built to deliver strong results, better care to patients, greater cost savings to clients and sustained growth for our shareholders.","2016 is our 30th anniversary as a company. Since we started in 1986, our goal has been the same: ensure patients and clients get the most value for the money they spend. As we look to the future, we see many more ways for us to improve healthcare. When we deliver on the two things our clients need most, controlling costs and achieving better patient outcomes, it is both a growth opportunity for us and a testament to our business model of alignment. We have a strong financial and operational foundation to build upon and we are differentiated with unique solutions that are in high demand and we will always lead, even if it means taking actions others cannot or will not.","While our clients face a challenging environment with rising drug prices and increasingly complex regulations, we stand with them, working together to find innovative ways to strengthen the pharmacy benefit while improving care. It is this alignment that resulted in our 97% retention in 2015 and gives us confidence going forward.","Our excellent operational performance, highlighted by our outstanding 1\/1\/2016 rollout, ensures patients and clients get the most from our unique collection of bold actions, specialized care, data insights, and innovative solutions. 1\/1\/2016 was without question the best 1\/1 in our history. Our relentless focus ensures every solution we put in place for clients creates maximum value for each member we care for. It opens the door to more forward-looking conversations with clients, which delivers better results for them and future growth for us.","You've heard us talk about the strength of our specialty, home delivery, core PBM and pharma services assets, and when we put them together, we provide a pharmacy offering that is unique and unmatched. A great example of our holistic strategy is SafeGuardRx, a unique collection of solutions that includes enhancements to our Hepatitis Cure Value program, our Cholesterol Care Value program and two industry firsts, an indication-based formulary and an Inflation Protection Program. These programs ensure clients' costs are minimized as we expand access to needed therapies and achieve better patient outcomes.","SafeGuardRx launched on 1\/1\/2016 to clients, and enrollment uptake has been immediate and unprecedented across our commercial and health plan clients. Our complex business is rooted in a simple premise: always act in alignment with client needs. Standing with clients, we take the bold actions that drive down their costs, eliminate pharmacy waste and serve patients better. As we have for the past 30 years and we expect to do well into the future, when we execute our strategy, clients and patients win and we grow.","Now I'll turn it over to George for some closing slots.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tim. I am confident in our business model, which is focused on achieving better health outcomes that in turn deliver strong financial performance and solid returns for our shareholders. Our core PBM business, specialty pharmacy, home delivery pharmacy, and pharma services business provide numerous levers to drive sustainable value for our patients, clients and shareholders.","With a record retention year and our best 1\/1 performance ever, we have momentum and are confident in our guidance and growth prospects. We are well-positioned for the short- and long-term for two important reasons: first, the value we provide clients has never been greater, and second, there is a growing appreciation for our unique business model of alignment.","All that said, we understand the uncertainty that exists related to Anthem's public comments. We also understand the certainty of our business. We are performing at a high level financially and operationally. We have a long-standing policy of keeping all client discussions strictly private. However, we know you have questions about what has changed with Anthem and here's what I'll say.","Our team is delivering great service to Anthem and its members. That has not changed. We are committed to helping Anthem control costs and win business. In fact, a significant amount of value is available to Anthem and its clients if Anthem were to adopt more of the cost-saving solutions already implemented by many of our other clients. That has not changed.","As we said on our 2016 Guidance Call in December, we remain fully committed to good faith negotiations in hopes of reaching a mutually beneficial agreement within the framework of our 2009 contract. That has not changed. That said, although I will not speak to specifics, Anthem is certainly not entitled to $3 billion and that has not changed.","We have an unwavering commitment to improve healthcare outcomes and lower drug costs with the best cost saving, clinically-sound solutions in the industry. We will continue to take bold actions to reshape healthcare by improving patient outcomes, controlling costs, and driving out waste. By doing our job well, we will continue to deliver strong financial performance and strong returns for our shareholders over the long term. I'm extremely proud of what we've been doing for the last 30 years and have never been more excited about our future.","Thank you for your time this morning. Now, we'll take your questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. Our first question comes from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you. Thanks for all the detail. George, is there any way to maybe just frame the size of Anthem? I know you talk about drug spend, but maybe talk about scripts or any profitability metrics or anything else to give us any color around that.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As I said in my remarks, we've been in this business for 30 years and we've grown significantly over that time period. And one of the keys to that, of course, is our business model, but really is the trust goes with that hand-in-hand of our clients trusting us to safeguard their data and to protect their information. And we just don't get into client-specific data. Again, we're on the middle of our \u2013 we're starting to kick off our selling season, we have our retention goals again for this year that we have to go achieve, and if you want to do business with us, the last thing we want to be seen doing is talking about our clients and putting out a bunch of information that they haven't disclosed because it's really not our place to disclose their information; it's their place.","And so it would be a heck of a lot easier for all of us if I could sit here and tell you exactly how much we make and how many scripts there are and whatever information you want, but two things. One, that door never closes; there'll be more and more information. And second, they haven't given us the permission or the right to disclose that and that's not a precedent we want to start. So I'm sorry to be vague about that, but we take our work very seriously and we take our client confidences personally. So I'm sorry, but that's all I can say.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yeah. And so just to that point, as we start the selling season, can you or maybe Tim just comment on two things? One, has there been any commentary from your existing clients around the Anthem dispute or do you expect it will have any impact on the selling season? And then secondly, can you just talk about this year's renewal? Is it a normalized year for renewal this year and, specifically, what do you think people are looking for in the 2017 selling season?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Yeah. So, first, thanks for the questions, Lisa. First, as it relates to the sort of any hangover from an Anthem perspective in the broader selling season or retention season, I would actually tell you zero in terms of that. I mean, that's back to George's comments. We have been very, very thoughtful about not putting anything out there in terms of public comments and so forth because we respect Anthem and we respect that the book of our business really needs us focus on them. So we have this very walled off as it relates to inside of our company, and our sales and account management teams are incredibly engaged.","You heard me speak about SafeGuardRx, and I can tell you, the uptake in that has been unlike anything I've seen in my 18 years in the business and it's just as testimony to the fact that our clients are focused on their challenges, they're focused on how we can solve their problems collaborating with them, and we've produced the kind of results that enable a really trusted conversation. And that really takes you into the 2016 renewal and 2017 selling season, which is early as George said, but what we see right now is a lot of interest in anything having to do with helping clients manage spend while creating access.","And obviously, we've taken some very specific positions on some things and then taking the actions behind those positions which have produced results and those are the conversations that we're having. And right now, at least, what I would tell you is it's kind of a normal renewal year for us so there's nothing extraordinary you'd see in our numbers. And because we've had a strong year last year, we're really leaning into the selling season very confidently this year.","Lisa Christine Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll just add a little color. The only other thing I would add to that is that although these conversations do not take place with respect to renewals or sales, obviously I know a lot of CEOs around this country and a lot of them are our clients, and people are a little dismayed that this is actually taking place in the public markets. You never heard Express Scripts or most companies have these conversations. So there is conversations about that, but not with respect to impacting our business or our ability to sell. But obviously a lot of CEOs are interested in watching us because that's quite a new experience for all of us.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","I mean, the only other color I can give you, Lisa, is just a data point that is anecdotal but it's \u2013 is nonetheless interesting is just last week we were very fortunate to extend for three more years to the end of 2019 a very large health plan relationship. Obviously they're well aware of what's going on and it didn't color or impact those conversations at all. The conversations were all around how we can help them grow their business which is what we're relentlessly focused on.","Operator","Okay. Thank you very much. Our next question comes from line of Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is now open.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So as we think about it, and I'll ask more one more question on Anthem here, but maybe with a retrospective view. So I think the stepping off point in considering profitability or what we've started with has often been, George, your comment in 2009 about $1 billion in synergy in 2011, and so I guess thinking back seven years there, when you provided that commentary, that was for synergy across the entire company at a point where Express Scripts was smaller than CVS and Medco. Is that a fair characterization?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's exactly right. When we did this transaction, one of the benefits we had was we were going to be able to take the business and fold it in on top of our existing business. There was \u2013 we shut down the systems that they ran to adjudicate claims. There was a lot \u2013 we had built some high-volume filling capacity and they were not being fully utilized. So this was a great opportunity to put more scripts on top of what \u2013 the infrastructure we already had and just to leverage our total cost base against more scripts. So the $1 billion was never meant to imply that that was just coming out of the Anthem book of business. It was really across the entire book as you stated.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that. And on the fundamentals, gross margin was strong throughout the year. I know that there was a role played by Econdisc in sourcing benefit. Will that benefit continue on, are you seeing a constant benefit there and maybe also to pass this to Tim as well, when you look at the SafeGuardRx \u2013 or SafeGuard programs, are those programs that are designed to impact trend and see a volume benefit, or do you actually generate incremental profit in those programs?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure. Thanks for both questions. First of all, I'll take the Econdisc question which is, we continue to be very pleased with the performance of Econdisc and continue to both expand its footprint in terms of what it's doing and in terms of looking at other potential members as well. So it will continue to perform, is the short answer to your question, and be a gross margin contributor. Really a great example of us leveraging not only scale but I think a unique approach to the marketplace. As it relates to SafeGuardRx, what I will do is actually, and Dr. Steve Miller is here, who's been out along with Dr. Stettin speaking with a lot of clients about it, and I'm going to let Steve just for a moment, sort of touch on it, because the short answer is it's a classic case of alignment that drives both outcomes for our clients and for ourselves. But I'll let Steve speak about that.","Steven B. Miller - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Hey, Eric. So this started actually with our Hepatitis Cure Value Program, and now a year into it we have some unbelievable proof points. Remember that we took risk on adherence with this drug because it was twice a day versus once a day, and now a year into it we can say that adherence has been over 95%. Our cure rate for those patients has been over 96%, and for our book of business, it saved our members and our clients $1 billion. And on top of that, for our shareholders, because these scripts are all going to Accredo, we actually make more money that way while providing superior service to patients. So the proof points have been extraordinarily strong. We've now extended that to Cholesterol. We're now looking into Oncology and bringing unique solutions to the marketplace and on top of that we've provided inflation protection for our members. So this is really a phenomenal win for both our patients, our clients, and for our Express Scripts shareholders.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Great. Thanks for the questions. George, I appreciate that you can't share too much on the Anthem contracts specifically but I think based on the quarterly filings and your comments this morning, clearly these discussions continue with Anthem regarding this periodic pricing review. I guess just from a high-level, can you share with us how those discussions have been progressing? Do you feel you're making progress towards a mutually beneficial solution? And are there specific areas that are sticking points within the contract right now?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","As I've said on numerous occasions, I really just do not want to get into the detail here. I understand as a shareholder there is a thirst for knowledge, but also, as a business leader, we have to safeguard our relationships and whatever we say here is clearly going to, it can come back and, it just doesn't do us any good to get into any kind of detail with this. And I know that's not very satisfying, but it really is the right thing to do. I couldn't imagine if I was having a challenge with one of my vendors that they would appreciate it if I was trying to air all their dirty laundry out and try to force a negotiation through a conference call with shareholders. That just doesn't seem appropriate to me. So that's just not the way we're going to do it. So again, I'm sorry about being vague, but I really do believe it's the right answer.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. No, that's fair. And I guess just moving to the 1Q guidance, EPS was a little light of where I think consensus was, again, but it came against probably better-than-expected claims guidance. Can you maybe just help us understand if there are any callouts or moving pieces in 1Q specifically? Were there some specifically large new starts that might have weighed on profitability per claim or anything else as far as maybe timing on SG&A reductions? Just trying to get a better idea of the EPS cadence for the year.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll certainly let Eric chime in here in a second, but I'll tell you there's a couple of things. One is, if you recall, we renewed our Department of Defense contract in May of last year, and with that was some additions to the business, so those started up through the course of the year and so as we lap ourself, we get those scripts kind of for the entire year this year. So that adds some to the volume. When you look at the quarterly run of earnings, if you look at historically the pattern, we're pretty much in line with that pattern of first quarter being down and then a replenishing throughout the year. So we're very comfortable with our first quarter guidance. And obviously our full-year guidance we believe is quite achievable and in line. Eric, I don't know if you want to add.","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I would just add to that, I mean, the trends will be similar to last year where it's roughly a 45\/55 split between the first half and the second half on our earnings generation. There is back-loading as we talked about on our guidance call earlier in December, we have significant efficiency initiatives, some SG&A cutting initiatives and some of our launches and timing of new generics will impact this. So if you look at the year-over-year, our first quarter projection is up significantly from first quarter last year, and I think if you look at historical trends over quarters, we'd expect to follow that this year.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Robert Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America","Thank you. I see you've got, George, $1.5 billion in debt due in May. But what's the likelihood of you making it through 2016 without finding an acquisition? We're kind of in that time zone every couple of years where we see something from Express. Any possible comments on the pipeline there?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You've known me for a long time, Robert. No. We can't speak to M&A activities. So obviously we have a team and we are looking for opportunities and we would definitely \u2013 as Eric said in his prepared comments, our first priority is to always fully invest in ourself to make sure that we have the best systems, the best operational approach and the best service for our patients and clients, and then our second priority is to look for M&A activity. So without getting into specifics, that's an ongoing process for us. And then of course, whatever money isn't deployed properly or, you know, through those two avenues, we will return to our shareholders. We want to be good stewards of the capital being entrusted to us.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America","Are there new areas, though, George? Has the business model evolved to the extent that there are new pieces that do fit? I don't know how to ask the question really, but what fits now that might not have fit 10 years ago?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, I think as I have said in the past, healthcare is evolving, and one thing we know for sure is the machine is not well-oiled and running smoothly. So at Express Scripts, we constantly look at what are our core capabilities and our assets and figure out how do we branch those out to continue to grow them. And I think there's an awful lot we've done. We've done a lot with growing not only in our Specialty segment but the distribution of Specialty products direct to the doctors and clinics. We've taken some niche areas and really focused on those with our CRCs and really built out a Specialty service in those areas. A lot of these businesses are smaller today but they're growing, and we'll continue to look for opportunities to bolt-on. I should actually let Tim talk more about this.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Yeah, good morning, Robert. I think George nailed it. What I would just say is if you look 10 years ago, we probably now are \u2013 would be more interested in something that we could bolt on to UBC from a pharma services perspective if it was attractive and made sense for the overarching model. I think HCIT, there's a lot of fragmentation there. We obviously have a lot of internal capabilities that we can invest in, but as we look out both from a payer and a provider standpoint, there may be some interest there.","As George said, Specialty continues to be an area of focused growth and interest for us to bring efficiency and improve patient care across a broad spectrum and service those patients in a unique way. So, those things are all interesting to us, and there are some other areas as well. As we look at building more direct relationship with our members through both a digital relationship and, excuse me, being a pharmacy provider, be it specialty or mail, we see opportunities there. Again, a lot of that is able to be built out internally, but we also do have a very active amount of work going on looking out in the market. Recognizing you would expect, our hurdle rates, while there's something strategic, we're very interested, are still high. We're going to set the bar high. We're not going to go out and just be on a spending spree because we've got the cash.","Robert McEwen Willoughby - Bank of America","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question from the line of Garen Sarafian of Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, everyone. Thanks for the color and trying to at least address Anthem head-on. But maybe following up on some of your comments, George, what types of programs could they add on that are commonly used by other clients, I guess other than getting on your formulary, I suppose, and how much of a cost savings does that typically achieve with other clients?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the one you hit on really is the big one, managing formularies. Dr. Miller talked extensively or talked about our SafeGuardRx program, and the savings in that are significant for our clients. So, one of the biggest things you can do to manage your cost is by really focusing your buying on the most efficacious, best-priced products and driving into those areas. I think it's there that the savings are quite substantial. And there's other things such as driving mail order, doing Specialty Management properly, and doing it in the best regards, all the different component \u2013 I mean, we can go on for a long time here, but there's a \u2013 we have a whole bunch of different options that could certainly be utilized here. And...","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Yeah, no, I think George hit the list. I mean, their whole retail networks, what you've seen obviously is a great deal of uptake there across our health plan book of business and certain lines of business, and there still remains significant opportunity for clients who are interested in narrowing their retail network and take advantage of the fact that there are over 70,000 retail pharmacies in the U.S.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Could you put that in perspective, though? So that if a \u2013 any large client gets onto your formulary that wasn't on it before, what types of savings? Is it 5% savings, is the narrow network another 1% to 3% savings? Is there any context you can put around those comments?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't really want to get into specifics with Anthem. I don't think that's appropriate. It's really is \u2013 they have to know their business, they have to know what markets they're selling in, and one size does not fit all. So you have to have a spectrum of products that you're offering up to the marketplace but you need to optimize your pricing on every one of those. And so I really don't want to get into it. Typically if we win a new client, so forgetting Anthem for minute, but any client, it really depends on where they are at.","If they have \u2013 because there's still some two-tier systems out there, believe it or not, and so if you're on a two-tier drug system and you come in, obviously the first big thing you do is put in a three-tier, then you start doing exclusions, you manage the formulary, you control the network. You drive mail. As you do each of those steps, the savings can be significant. Somebody that's already sophisticated and already down a path, and it's about how do you tweak it to take advantage of the trends that are existing in the current marketplace? So there really isn't a one-size-fits-all, but we do believe there's significant value to be had by better managing the product line.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Fair enough. And second question, again, I realize the sensitivity of the client discussions, but since it was already brought up, the $3 billion in annual savings figure that you stated as being inaccurate, I might have \u2013 you might have used another term, but that's the sense I got. So, as you're in discussions with clients through the various processes, just broadly speaking, do you usually have the opportunity to review client claims or the savings figures that they're anticipating? Just trying to better understand where the basis for such figures can come from and just wondering if you can just shed some light on that if you could.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, just two different points here. I'll answer your question, just a second, but I have no clue where the $3 billion came from. I have no concept, the number doesn't make any sense to me. So if you really want to get into that, you got to talk to Anthem about that. As far as the \u2013 our client situation, if it's an existing client, depending on the size and their willingness or their desire to meet with us and control their costs, we could either meet quarterly or annually with them, some more often than even that. And the idea is to sit down because we process every claim, we see the trends, we know what's happening, our goal is to sit down and say, okay, if the drug trends are doing a certain amount, how is that client, let's say they're in the \u2013 pick a business, they're in the paint business, making paint or whatever, manufacturing, the idea is to line them up against other manufacturers because they're going to have similar demographics in their employment bases and compare the trends of their drug spend versus the trends of the industry.","You don't show them individual other clients but you can show aggregate values and show whether or not they're in the \u2013 below the midpoint, above the midpoint or at the midpoint for controlling costs and then what are the bigger drivers of our costs? Our clinicians and account management team spend hours monthly, quarterly, annually with our clients going through that process so that they constantly stay on top, tweak the benefits as they go, and then especially before they roll out their enrollment for the upcoming year, they can tweak their benefits and really get them in line to better control costs in the next year as well.","If it's a new client opportunity where we have a real \u2013 when it's a \u2013 all RFPs are different, but if we have the opportunity, we'd love to get historical claims data and do the same analysis so we walk in and bid the business, we can speak to exactly what our programs are going to save them, and also how much disruption. By disruption we mean how many people are affected. So sometimes some of the highest cost trends have very little usage on a per capita basis, so you can take a big change in the cost trend by only touching a handful of people, and so you can go after different savings opportunities. And that's how we win in the marketplace.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Yeah, and all I would add, Garen, is that \u2013 yesterday is a great example. We had a gigantic industrial company that's been a long-term client in our lab, they were here for a day and a half, we modeled out a number of things that they could do. We visually showed them the impact on populations, we did different scenarios and so forth. Dr. Stettin was hosting them there and so probably 200 times a year we have clients that actually come to St. Louis and take one additional step which is to really engage in developing very unique solutions, collaborating with us in our labs. So it is a very dynamic process.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","That's useful. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of John Kreger of William Blair. Your line is now open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. As you guys look across your book in the fourth quarter, maybe even early days here in 2016, can you just comment on any of the trends you're seeing such as any trend in utilization per capita or perhaps inflation across the brand and generic book?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. What I'd say from a utilization standpoint is we're seeing very, very low increases in pure utilization, and I think that that tracks with what we kind of expected and what we said back when we did guidance. So we're not seeing anything as an uptick, let's call it that. And some of that's because we're doing our job well but also just generally out in the market we're not seeing a dramatic increases in utilization. So that remains a potential tailwind that has not happened at this point.","As it relates to generic inflation, what we've seen is what you probably read about, which is not an issue. Our GPO does a great job, first of all, so we have always on a net basis been able to sort of handle that issue even when others were struggling with it. But this year, we continue to see what I would say is fairly low to no inflation there and it's arguably a little bit less than last year, which again tracks with what others have reported.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. Can I have it on the brand side?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","On the brand side, I mean, you've seen sort of \u2013 it's definitely been a little bit moderated from last year and it's still early. We've certainly seen some brand manufacturers take some price increases, largely in line with our expectations at this point, I'd say within a point or so of our expectations. But it's still early. So, it's really difficult to declare kind of how the year is going to play out.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks. And then one last one, can you just talk a bit more about SafeGuardRx? As the uptick of that ramps, how does that alter the economics to you if at all in terms of when profit might be realized through the year? Is there's any sort of risk assumption on your part? If you could just expand a little bit more about how that model would work, it would be helpful.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. What I'd say is, obviously, and I won't break it down into pieces because of course the Hepatitis Care Value Program, or Cure Program, it's opportunity down the road as new entrants into the marketplace and the ability to go back and essentially recast yet again the cost of treating those patients. So \u2013 and that continues to be an opportunity for us to dynamically manage and deliver for our clients. I think the big piece is as you look at inflation, we don't know how the year is going to come out. So we're putting something sort of in place now but we won't be able to ascertain. If we do our job really well there, we will do a little bit better at the back half of the year and you would expect it to be more in the back half of the year as inflation mounts and as we hold our clients harmless to the numbers we give them and as pharma then remits to the commitments that they've made to us contractually.","And so it really \u2013 from our perspective, the program itself is terrific for clients and for us. I think the bigger story, though, is the relationship we have with pharma and how that increases the conversations and the leverage that we have. I think if you go back a couple of years ago, the thought was from a pharma standpoint, narrow formularies, how long can that run rate last? And I think what we've demonstrated with SafeGuardRx and in dozens of conversations we're continuing to have with pharma is that it is a lot more than just a narrow formulary that we can create when we bring innovation to working with pharma to create access for patients and the right cost profile for payers.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of George Hill of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning, guys. And I'm going to ask you to forgive me already for belaboring the point of Anthem because saying that Anthem is not entitled to $3 billion is not necessarily the same as saying that they don't \u2013 you guys don't make $3 billion on the contract. The question that I want to ask, is there anything \u2013 are there any goalposts that you can put around the earnings risk as it relates to the Anthem contract to make investors more comfortable?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Again, I don't want to belabor the point either but we really can't get into the details here and it's just once we start opening these doors, it's really, there's no way to stop it. So I really do believe we need to stay silent and not have these negotiations done on this phone call but with them.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And, I guess, Eric, one kind of follow-up question, just kind of a smaller point. The transaction costs kind of jumped up a little bit this quarter. I guess a few years after the Medco transaction we thought these costs would be winding down to almost nothing I guess. Can you tell us the outlook for transaction costs, the portion that are cash and what we should expect in 2016?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, as we said on our guidance call, there will be no more carving out transaction costs. All that integration activity is completed so the answer is, it is zero for 2016.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. I appreciate the color there. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good morning. So, George, I have to ask one Anthem question. So back in the December call, you did say that you were hoping that the negotiation could potentially include an extension beyond the 2019 contract term. So that sounds like a door you opened for us. So where you stand today does the current negotiation still contemplate a potential extension or is it really just focused on the current contract term?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, again, I'm sorry, but I really do not want to get into the details of our negotiation. I really do think that's between Anthem and us. And obviously we would love to have an extension as part of this agreement. And I think it's up to us to negotiate with them and find out what's tolerable and works for them and what's good for us and our shareholders.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Eric, I think in the prepared remarks you mentioned the guiding range with just kind of like, better results, more confidence, it seems that you have not changed the underlying metric. So should we think about it as potential more upside as the year progresses, or is the increase kind of at the midpoint more reflection of below the line changes?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, I would characterize it as I did in my remarks that every day, every week we get better visibility. We're now almost 2 months since we gave our initial guidance, and what we do in our supply chain and everything in generics and timing those launches, we just continue to get better and better visibility each day, and as we progressed the first month and a half of this year, we feel more comfortable with the outlook and some of the things we're seeing, so we decided initially we went wide with our GAAP on EPS, and as we progress through the year, we'd expect to continue to narrow that. And we'll adjust it accordingly but right now, we like what we see in the first half of the month, so we felt good about increasing the lower end and obviously pushing the midpoint up.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So should we think about it also because you guided to EBITDA 3% to 5% year-over-year growth, so should we think of that also as kind of like pushing that more towards the 4%-plus range?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","At this point in the year, I wouldn't push that. Again, if you think about your EBITDA range, that's in billions, and we meet move a penny of EPS, we're talking millions. So I would, as you see here, we didn't adjust EBITDA, but we're very comfortable with our guidance in that space and I would just expect to update you next quarter on any continued progress.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Charles Rhyee of Cowen &Co. Your line is now open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask a question actually about drug pricing and you kind of talked us through SafeGuardRx, so I want to ask is sort of two ways and I know you touched on it, but can you talk also specifically how the Inflation Protection Program works, sorry if I missed that earlier. And then secondly, you guys have taken some strong positions in the past trying to work on behalf of your clients, and internally, if we think about the issue around drug pricing, it's really an adversarial relationship between payers and manufacturers. As we move forward, though, if we're trying to balance sort of cost versus innovation, are there ways you think that actually payers can work with manufacturers to be more cooperative? And I guess an example of that, do you see sort of more outcomes-based methods of formulary placement coming to greater usage? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure. I'll take both questions. First of all, just at a macro level, the way Inflation Protection works is that we're able to go out, we contract with the pharma manufacturers who make commitments around sort of the maximum pricing that they will take above which they will, through us, create value that we can then build back into the programs for our clients. So in essence, we go out, we don't reinsure because we're not taking true risk in an insurance sense. What we're doing is we're sort of out there contracting with pharma and then passing that back through the program that we've got. So it's a very \u2013 it holds pharma accountable, and at the same time, it puts our clients in a great position to the extent that inflation is higher than what we were able to cap it in these contracts.","And what I would say as it relates to the adversarial piece is there is no question that there are opportunities for us and payers generally to work with manufacturers who want to take a responsible view. In effect, we provide an excellent way for those manufacturers to get to market in a way that is responsible, that creates maximum access for their innovative products, that ensures that there isn't wasteful behaviors taking place, and so \u2013 and we have a great example of that in our PCSK9 approach. You saw what we did in Hep C. That was a \u2013 we're not a one-trick pony. To the contrary. We really believe that in the long run, we can work very collaboratively with manufacturers to create access at a fair price to our payers. And there's a lot of room for negotiation and sort of argument about what fair price is, and we work very, very relentlessly on behalf of our clients to drive for that.","So yes is the short answer. And as we look at the pipeline, we see \u2013 I was at a conference last week with a large number of pharma manufacturers, and several of them cornered me with specific ideas about outcomes-based or indication-based pricing and wanting to do it. And their challenge is not having the data, which we have. And so we actually think we're in a perfect spot to help bring those things to life.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful. And just a clarification on the Inflation Protection Program. How many pharma companies do you have sort of signing up for this? Is it a large swath yet, or is it \u2013 would you say it's still sort of infancy? And maybe in what area, like what disease categories are you currently kind of working in?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","That's \u2013 it's a great question. What I would say is the vast majority of pharma companies are working with us to support Inflation Protection right now, and it's across all therapeutic chapters.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot, guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Steven Valiquette of UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks for taking the question. George, I do appreciate and respect you not wanting to get in the weeds on Anthem, so I'm hoping this is a fairly general question. I think on your 2016 guidance call back in December when you voluntarily brought up that 2012 Anthem price review, and I think the point you were trying to make is that these reviews are somewhat routine and eventually get resolved, and that investors shouldn't get too worked up about this. I'm wondering if, first, you could confirm that was kind of the message back then, but also I think just secondarily, is there any color on why you think that review back in 2012 seemed to reach a mutually beneficial conclusion without much fanfare but this one just seems to be more contentious? I guess what's changed so much since then in your view, just generally speaking? Thanks.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, well, I'll try to add a little color, but again, I don't want to cross any lines here. Back in 2012, we did reach a mutually agreed-upon outcome. And I think part of it is if you look at our total book of business, a lot of our clients do have what we call price checks. And in those price checks, they have the right to look at pricing and make sure that we are doing the right things for them, and those are pretty routine. And we go through a bunch of those every year.","There's a difference in this one, though, and it's contractual, and it's all of the data that's out on, you know, that's been disclosed. But here, you know what, it's not your traditional price check because of the very large upfront money that was paid out in this deal. So I can't really speak to why we haven't reached an agreement yet, but we are focused on reaching an agreement. I do think that there's a lot to be gained by reaching an agreement, especially if it's in lockstep with them modernizing their benefit, because if they do that, then the economics to their plans is significant.","And again, we work together hand-in-glove to get that economics out of the supply chain and better focus their buy. It's better economics for them, it's good for us, and it's really good for their clients and their members and their patients. So we're very hopeful that we can reach an agreement, but I can't give you any assurances or talk to \u2013 nor will I talk to the process or how we're going about it.","Steven J. Valiquette - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. All right. That's helpful for the extra color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Jason Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Hey, guys. It's Jason Plagman on for Brian. Just wondering, can you share any color on how your rebate discussions with clients have kind of evolved over the last few years? And what's your view on your ability to drive incremental gross margin expansion over the next few years?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Yeah. I mean, obviously, since launching our National Preferred Formulary, for those clients on that formulary, those conversations have been basically a continued demonstration of value and demonstration that we can care for patients in a way that can significantly move share in ways that produce either value or punishment the pharma companies that are either participating to help our clients get their costs and wastes at appropriate level or not. And I would say that's gone beyond, though, the National Preferred Formulary.","While that's the cornerstone to our leverage, we work with any number of clients who are not on that formulary to help them at a drug level or therapeutic chapter level also go deep and create additional value by virtue of modeling and understanding those dynamics. And so from that standpoint, it's been very powerful over the last several years. As we've become more innovative in our contracting, we've been able to do things such as inflation caps and so forth. We've been able to actually expand access to the formulary rather than narrow it in some spots by virtue of actually creating a financial model where it was better than \u2013 the PCSK9s being the most recent example, but certainly not the only example.","I think that the last piece I'd say is as we've been able to get significant value there, clients are more than willing to share that value with us because of the fact it aligns us so well to keep taking the bold actions that are in both of our interests.","Jason Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Thanks. It's helpful. And, Eric, you mentioned some efficiency initiative and SG&A initiative this year. How should we think about your ability to leverage your SG&A spend as a percentage of revenue over the next few years?","Eric R. Slusser - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Well, as we did this year, when we sit down and do our budget, we look at SG&A very closely and take a bottoms-up approach. And as I talked about, there's a lot of reduction initiatives in place. I think if you look at our actual spend for 2015 and our 2016 guidance, you'll see those numbers are pretty similar despite all the normal increases you have to deal with, vendor built-in increases. We continue to do things here to take all that increase out and continue to improve efficiency particularly around our operations, our fulfillment process as I talked about. We will be very, very attentive to those costs over the next few years. We believe we've got a really good base to support growth.","Certainly, if we were to add a large client, you've got to add the support staff to take care of that client. But from a true back office SG&A perspective, we're very comfortable with where we're at and I certainly would not expect to see any big increases in that as we move through the next couple of years.","Jason Plagman - Jefferies LLC","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Vendetti of Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Thank you. Yes. I was just wondering if you could talk about what the total gross or net client wins were for 2016. CVS gave that number out in their call; I think it was $14.8 billion. Just wondering if you could just talk about the number. And you said retention rate was 97% just as we look forward for this year. And obviously, the focus is on Anthem. Are there any other major contracts that we should be focused on?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","So I'm not \u2013 I can't comment on the other guy's number. What I'd say is the 97%, you take the 97% plus the fact that you know that we had some Coventry roll-off and you look at our claims year-over-year being close to flat.","What you can therefore see is that we had a good selling season as well as a good retention season. And therefore, if you backed out that, it would've been a net growth story. And we're very, very pleased with our selling season last year as well as obviously our 97%. So from that standpoint, I think that's probably the best way to think about it.","And I'm sorry, the other part of your question was?","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Just if you could give us the net gross client wins in terms of dollar amounts for 2016?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Yeah, I don't have that at hand and we \u2013 that's not the way we think about it or look at it. We really do look at claims and so forth and internally look at a lot of other dimensions but \u2013 so I'm not prepared to give you that today.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of David Larsen of Leerink Partners. Your line is now open.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hey. Tim, do you have any incremental thoughts on what your longer-term retail strategy might look like? And specifically, do you have any developing plans to counter CVS' Maintenance Choice? Any details around any potential joint ventures or partnerships that you're considering would be helpful. Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","Sure. So, obviously, you would expect me to say I don't have any big announcements today as it relates to any of that. What I would say is the reason we like our independent model so well is that we have very constructive conversations across the retail supply chain.","As it relates specifically to the Maintenance Choice program, we actually have two offerings in the marketplace which are directly responsive to clients who are interested in that: one of them with Walgreens and then one which is a non-Walgreens option. I wouldn't say the uptake has been dramatic, but I would say that for clients or prospects who are either in or interested in a retail 90 mail combination program, we have a very strong offering.","As it relates to the broader retail context, though, as I said, with over 70,000 retail chains out there and with clients very willing to work with us and take advantage of what we've proven we can do in terms of helping patients find the most efficient \u2013 whether it's drug choice or a channel choice, we continue to have very interesting conversations with retail. We have a very collaborative relationship with the major retailers, but we also will do our job as it relates to creating narrow networks that produce value; but for clients who want broader networks, also being sure that we've got something that meets their needs.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","That's great. Thanks very much. And for those retail 90 programs that you do have in place, is the price of the mail scripts the same as the price of the retail scripts for 90-day supplies? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","It really depends on a particular client and sort of how they want value to be shared. So it's a piece that we can do, but a lot of it depends on where the client's volume is, where they're trying to move their volume. We're able to be very, very flexible as relates to how we, at an individual client level, create value.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Great. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you very much. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Coldwell of Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. My question was hit on just a few callers ago, but I want to go into it a different way.","First off, your head count according to the 10-K is down about 3,600 employees, which is over 12% year-on-year. Your SG&A dollars are flat. Your SG&A to revenue has only improved 2 basis points. I guess the question is where did you find almost 4,000 heads to let go? What's the head count target for ending 2016?","And why didn't the magnitude of that adjustment to head count do more to improve your expense line here? It seems like there's much more growth in underlying SG&A than is really showing up in the model. And I'm not sure how you can continue to let 3,500, 4,000 people go each year to maintain flat SG&A.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's not really \u2013 as you might suspect, it doesn't really work that way. So, first of all, where we have a lot of redundancies to the acquisition is in our operations which goes to DPC and gross profit. So as we shut down facilities and we consolidate operations to get better efficiency that reduces head count.","In addition to that, we also, over the last couple of years, have made some very big investments in our infrastructure in order to make sure that we can continue to drive cost. I echo what Eric said earlier and that is we've always had a big focus on taking out costs.","When we bought Medco, if you go back and look year-over-year at SG&A and SG&A per script, we had a pretty good spike that drove up the cost because of the redundancies in the businesses. And there's one thing to consolidate the technology platforms, but it's a whole another thing to start consolidating all of the \u2013 or integrating all of the processes. And that's what they're in the midst of doing as we speak.","We still have an awful lot of inefficiencies in our mail order service that we can still go after and we think that there's still a significant room to run there, so I do believe that this is going to be an annual exercise for us. It always has been and it will remain an exercise to focus on costs. What's adding value to our patients and whatever isn't, get rid of it. And that will stay our goal.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Do you have a goal for head count in 2016 that you could share with us?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not that we're going to share because we have our employees listening in on this as well, so we don't need to cause any issues in our company.","Eric W. Coldwell - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thanks very much.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Why don't we do one more call?","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from the line of Michael Baker of Raymond James. Your line is now open.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks a lot, George and Tim, for taking the questions. I was wondering outside of Anthem, you deal with a number of Blues. By my count, at least 8 to 10. I was wondering if you could comment \u2013 in general, obviously, at high-level retention, I believe one of them you kind of publicly announced a renewal of the general state of relations with them and how they leverage you differently than, say, Anthem. Or is the main difference just the upfront payment that was made to Anthem as part of buying the assets?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I said this earlier and I can certainly have Tim jump in, but very seldom in a client contractual situation you make a big upfront payment. So this is a far different situation that exists with Anthem.","And I would say that at least from my perspective, and I know the CEOs of all these companies, we have very good relationships. We work very collaboratively together. We look at the markets in which they're operating and design programs that meet their needs, whether it'd be a Medicare, Medicaid, or the commercial line of business. We tailor our products to meet the needs of those clients and I think we have very strong, very good relationships. And quite frankly, we renewed quite a few of those Blues plans while all of this has been going on. So this doesn't really cause an overhang for our clients.","Again, internally, this isn't the best thing in the world, doing these calls and talking purely about Anthem instead of all the great stuff that our company is doing when controlling drug cost, driving trends and doing what's \u2013 help to try to take out the cost of. Inefficient cost of healthcare is really what we're focused on. And so as a management team, a handful of us deal with the Anthem situations, but 99.9% of our employees are dealing with making the business work and running in the fashion that we're proud of.","So that's probably as far as I really want to go with that, unless, Tim, you got anything you want to add.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","I mean, the only thing I would add is we work shoulder-to-shoulder with our Blues to build their brands and whether it's executing our digital strategy through their brand and their digital assets, whether it's selling side-by-side with them in the marketplaces. Just yesterday, we had one of our gigantic Blues plans renewed their largest account where we were offered the opportunity to bid directly or work with a Blues plan. We helped them win it.","You saw the announcement from the one Blue plan, we actually \u2013 that was a co-announcement. We normally don't announce our wins, but that particular plan wanted to do that announcement. Yeah, I think what was of note wasn't this that they announced it and that it was a long-term renewal, but that it spoke to our solutions that they were taking to help them manage their marketplaces and win and drive down costs of their clients. And that's what we're driven to do, Michael, and it's something that's in the fabric of our company.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Yeah, just one follow-up, George. In the past, I know you talked to some Blues that are non-client Blues today, and you kind of mentioned prime from time to time, is there any color in some of the conversations you're having there? I mean not specific to any transaction or anything like that, but just more general flavor of some of the changing dynamics and challenges of some of the other Blues that are non-customers.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the Blues that aren't customers, without giving any specifics, are all opportunities. And so we stay very much involved. We make sure that we call on them, we talk to them and we understand what their needs are. So when it is time for them to go out for bids, we're well-positioned in order to compete effectively for the business. And again, like you would expect, the Anthem question would come up, but again, this is \u2013 it's really we don't go out and structure deals like the one we have with Anthem. So that's a one-off, and that doesn't really get in the way of our ability to grow and win new business.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President & Director","No, the only other thing I'd add color-wise, Michael, is when you look at the roster of leaders that we've got here at Express Scripts and I'll just call out a couple of things, we have purposely built ourselves to understand more broadly healthcare and health plans in their uniqueness.","So whether it's Phyllis Anderson who had a deep health plan background that joined us from a very large well-managed plan; Eric Slusser who came with significant health plan, understanding and experience at high, very challenging reimbursement levels in the business he was in, so he understands those sorts of challenges; Dave Queller, who came out of a very large health plan and again, understands that business well; Everett Neville, who we promoted to Supply Chain who actually used to run our Health Plan Division; the table that I sit at has deep understanding of health plans and the conversations that we have are all about how do we win and make ourselves more valuable to our existing clients, which will create natural opportunities across those that we don't have today to bring our scale to bear so that they can compete with these giants that are being created through the M&A that is going on more broadly in healthcare.","Michael J. Baker - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.","Thanks for the color.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. And we appreciate everybody's time this morning. We hope you all have a great weekend and just have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating.

With me today are George Paz, Chairman and CEO; Tim Wentworth, President; Jim Havel, Interim CFO and other members of our senior management.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement.

The press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.express-scripts.com.","At this point, I will turn the call over to George.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Chris, and good morning everyone. Today, I will provide a perspective on the healthcare landscape and Express Scripts' unique and differentiated position. Then, Jim and Tim will discuss our solid first quarter results, 2015 guidance, and provide a business update.","Let me start by reinforcing a few themes we discussed at our recent Investor Day. We continue to be bullish on the PBM industry. PBMs are vital to driving competition, eliminating pharmacy wastes, and expanding access to prescription drugs, specifically we are vital, we are uniquely positioned as the optimal choice to America to advantage America's pharmacy benefits. Our standalone model works. While our competitors within the PBM marketplace face inherent complex of interest due to their association with other players within the healthcare services industry, Express Scripts remains completely aligned with our clients' needs. When we see a member, we see a patient, not a retail customer. Because we give the best unbiased care to patients, we are the trusted voiced plan sponsors. As a result, we can take strong and effective actions on their behalf to always make the use of prescription drug safe or more affordable. We are taking advantage of strategic opportunities to build Express Scripts into the industry leader. We continue to believe strategic possibilities exists, which would complement our strength and not conflict with our alignment to client interests.","These considerations are especially important when you recognize the significant size and scale in delivering value to our clients. Recent news only validates importance of scale within our industry. In today's environment, no other PBM is positioned with our focused size, scale and depth of innovative solutions. With these unique advantages and our commitment to improved health outcomes and lower costs, we will continue to drive change in healthcare. While the healthcare environment has evolved, three key attributes have remained critical to our success. Providing quality patient care, aligning with clients, and leveraging our focused size and scale.","Express Scripts combines these qualities in a manner unmatched in healthcare. We organized the market for the efficient distribution of prescription drugs and drive value to payers, patients and providers by actively managing the supply chain really by improving health outcomes, controlling costs for our clients, and delivering growth and strong results to shareholders. Our model of alignment clearly resonates with clients as you can see in our strong first quarter results.","I will now turn the call over to Jim to discuss these results in more detail.","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, George. Good morning, everyone. Yesterday, we reported solid first quarter EPS of $1.10, which represents an increase of 11% over last year. Other highlights in the quarter include adjusted claims with $307.6 million, consistent with our guidance range; SG&A decreased as a result of continued effort to drive efficiencies and deliver a competitive cost structure, and we generated EBITDA of $1.5 billion resulting in an EBITDA per claim of $4.92, up 7.0% from the prior year.","In addition, we entered into a new credit facility in the aggregate amount of $7.5 billion. We replaced our undrawn existing revolving loan facility and used a portion of the proceeds to repay our previously existing term loan. Our intent is to use approximately $5.5 billion of the proceeds for an accelerated share repurchase in the near term.","As a result of exploring strategic transactions, we did not repurchase shares in the first quarter. We believe executing on an ASR in the near-term positions us to stay in line with the company's full-year guidance.","Finally, after giving effect to the new credit facility, we are currently at 2.6 times debt-to-EBITDA ratio. We intend to delever through the remainder of 2015 getting back to our historical debt-to-EBITDA ratio of approximately 2 times.","As a result of delivering a solid growth, we are narrowing our guidance for adjusted earnings per diluted share to a range of $5.37 to $5.47. This range maintains the previously guided midpoint of $5.42 and represents growth of 10% to 12% year-over-year. As outlined in the tables, we are maintaining the range for all other metrics. As I mentioned, in spite of not repurchasing shares in the first quarter, we believe executing an accelerated share repurchase program in the near-term will allow us to be in the range of 695 million to 750 million diluted shares outstanding by the end of 2015.","With respect to the second quarter of 2015, we expect EPS to be in the range of $1.39 to $1.43, up 13% to 16% year-over-year. Consistent with recent years, we anticipate earnings related to a large client contract will be realized in the second quarter. As I've stated we continue to guide to a midpoint of $5.42 for the full-year EPS.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Thanks, Jim, and good morning. The beginning of 2015 has only served to reinforce our confidence in the retention range we provided at our Investor Day. On the slide you see three significant reasons for our confidence: alignment, trust, and action.","First, alignment, which is the core principle of our business model and it remains very simple. What is best for our client is best for us. As we align with clients and work together as a group, we harness the power of our size and scale. We create deep, meaningful client relationships by delivering quality patient care, controlling costs, and providing leading-edge solutions that create more value in the pharmacy benefit.","Second is trust. Integrity, ethics along with steadfast alignment are the starting points for earning the trust of our clients. But patient care is the trust multiplier. Nowhere is that more apparent than our Therapeutic Resource Centers staffed by specialist pharmacists who deliver the best possible care to chronic and complex patients.","For example, we are only a few months into our Hepatitis Cure Value Program, but we see patients achieving better adherence than at retail and clients realizing significantly greater savings. Our work in hepatitis C goes far beyond driving down the cost of the cure; however, more importantly we have increased access and improved health outcomes. Trust is only granted when you do all three of those things well and that's what we do everyday.","Finally, action. We will not stop being aggressive advocates for clients and patients. Many of you saw The Wall Street Journal article on Monday about pharma manufacturers buying competitors and then dramatically inflating the price of their drugs. Our utilization management solutions protect payers from those exact practices and have already saved clients millions of dollars. Alignment and trust enable us to take bold actions that truly make medicine affordable for our clients and patients.","Now, let me turn to a few highlights on the first quarter performance and review some upcoming events. While we are still in the heart of our selling and renewal season, we remain confident in our retention range. As we mentioned at Investor Day in January, we already have retained a number of key clients across their book of business. Our momentum continues with significant interest in our solutions and clients who are strongly voting to stay with Express Scripts for the long-term.","Changes are constant in our industry and we understand that market dynamics present an opportunity to position Express Scripts as a stable, focused, unambiguously aligned option for our clients and prospects. In fact, at our upcoming Outcomes conference in mid-May, we expect to welcome nearly three times as many prospects as we have in prior years representing tens of millions of potential new prescription clients. That's but one indicator of the growing interest in our model and our solutions.","Our Outcomes theme this year is PHARMACY.SMARTER. Data convincingly show that patients who use our pharmacies are more satisfied, more adherent, and spend less money on their medicines than those who fill their prescriptions at retail. Our specialized clinical approach provide safer, more effective, and more affordable care, and importantly emboldens clients to trust us to leverage their collective size to achieve superior outcomes, our Hepatitis C Value Program being just one example.","No one else in our industry comes close to delivering the value, service and care that we do. That's PHARMACY.SMARTER.","From an operational perspective, we continue to advance in delivering a better experience for patients no matter how they interact with us. Clients continue to find our solutions are opening doors for them to generate greater savings and provide better care. There is no doubt that our evolving services and solutions will continue to play a critical role in achieving results for patients and clients.","When you add it all up, one thing is very clear, Express Scripts is extremely well-positioned to be the PBM of choice. Our differentiated business model of patient care, client alignment, focus and unmatched scale drives meaningful change in healthcare.","Our innovative solutions generate organic growth and we have an unmatched ability and focus to work with clients to control costs and improve outcomes for patients. When we create value for clients we create opportunities for our own growth.","Thank you for your time today. And, operator, we'll now take your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Thanks and good morning. Jim, just wanted to follow up on the ASR. You seemed to make some comments regarding the first quarter that the company was somewhat limited in terms of what it could buy back from a share repurchase perspective. So could you maybe comment on the lack of cash flow in 1Q and maybe what happened in 1Q that kept you out of the market and the decision right now to kind of do the ASR? Any details around that ASR that would help us think about the share count for the balance of the year would be helpful.","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Sure. I appreciate the question, and that's got some multi-faceted questions. So let me just start by talking a little bit about the ASR. First off, I want to emphasize we've not yet executed any agreement for the ASR, but we'll talk about our plans and then generally what to expect in an ASR.","We plan to execute in the near term and commit about $5.5 billion to the ASR. Generally, when you look at an ASR, what it basically means is that the day you commit, ESI will remit the full proceeds to the counterparty, the counterparty will then deliver, say, typically 70% to 90% of the shares contemplated in agreement to us on day one. Over the course of time then, the counterparty or counterparties, given this is a fairly large transaction, will purchase the shares in the open market, of course they'll be subject to daily volume restrictions.","The process \u2013 given the relative size, the process will probably take, say, nine months to 12 months to complete. Over that period of time, the company will bear the risk of fluctuating stock price to the extent a maximum price is not agreed in the agreement. At the end of the process, the parties will settle up. So that final settlement will happen at the end of the period, which given nine to 12 months, probably will be some time in 2016.","The advantages to the company include the share repurchase is conducted in a very orderly and efficient manner. It also allows the company to achieve our planned capital structure for 2015 and confirm that structure. Also we're able to acquire the shares at a nice discount to VWAP. The other real advantage is the counterparty can continue in the open market even through blackout date, so they really have no restrictions.","So in summary, we are able to achieve our planned capital structure for 2015. We have no reported impact on stated EPS guidance. It should allow us to be in the range of 695 million to 750 million diluted outstanding shares at the end of the period. And, of course, all the details will be finalized when we sign the agreement, but that's our plan for the ASR.","In terms of Q1, your question was, why were you out, or were you out of the market? We were out of the market because we were considering strategic options. The window doesn't \u2013 there is not a very wide window for Q1 on a regular basis and again we were considering options and so the window was closed for the period.","In terms of cash flow for the period. The cash flow was reasonably strong. There is some working capital commitment that's made mostly related to CSM (sic) [CMS] (15:33) payments related to Medicare reimbursement. But that really was the only hitch or the only comparative hitch in the quarter. But that's just a timing issue and we continue to be comfortable with our year-end forecast of $4.5 billion to $5 billion in total cash.","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hey, Jim. Maybe if I just ask one follow-up to that. It kind of sounds like that based on the ASR, you'll be within your share count range that you sort of gave last quarter within the guidance. But last quarter you gave much more detailed components to the guidance. And so given that this ASR is going to bring you in line with your full year expectations on the EPS side, are you implying anything or saying anything about EBITDA as we look out for the balance of fiscal 2015? Are you changing the assumptions in any way regarding the guidance that you gave last quarter, or any of those components of the guidance?","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","No, we're really not. And the reason I say that is because if we had an absolute final agreement maybe that would be easier to calculate, but the reality is there's variables in this thing in terms of timing, number of shares, price per share etc. And so we feel comfortable that we \u2013 as we talked about it, we will be within the stated ranges and we're not making any negative or positive comments at all on that stated EBITDA guidance and the margins.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Just let me add in a little bit there too. When we \u2013 to echo Jim's point, nothing's really changing. We're hitting the original guidance we gave coming into this year. The one thing I do want to emphasize though \u2013 well, two things. Going forward, we'll make sure we put in our press releases more detail. I think our thoughts were that if we only highlighted the things that were going to change or reaffirm, and the reality is we showed in our slides earlier, through this presentation is that we're still comfortable with the original guidance we've given.","Having said all that, let's keep in mind what takes place. Our script counts accelerate throughout the second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter as our sales from last year kick in and those clients onboard and come online live. Those scripts as you know, because the new sales are always at lower margins, we expect to see a decline in gross profit or EBITDA per script on those scripts. But aggregate gross profit and gross margin should grow as we've laid out in the forecast.","So gross margin is going to continue to grow, gross profit and EBITDA will grow, scripts will grow at a slightly faster rate which means we'll have a little bit of a depression on EBITDA per script going into the second half in the fourth quarter of the year.","Glen J. Santangelo - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Thanks for the details.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. You may ask your question.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. George, thanks for your comments at the beginning where you talked about the PBM industry and your thoughts around being a standalone and the opportunities that that garners for Express Scripts. But I'm just curious if you or Tim can talk about what your clients are looking for right now? There's been a lot of talk about the retail PBM model. Do you feel like you need a closer alignment with a retailer in some way? How is the Smart90 program going with Walgreens at this point?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'll take it on. And then, Tim, make sure if I leave something out, feel free to chime in. I do believe \u2013 and I think, Lisa, you said this for several quarters if not a year now. I do think that there is value to a retailer owning a PBM and that you can try to push people into your stores. That's not \u2013 our clients aren't really coming to us saying I want to go to Walgreens or want to go to Rite Aid or CVS or any grocery stores. They're coming to us looking for solutions to manage their costs. Costs are accelerating at unprecedented rates. Had it not been for all the work of our team with Everett Neville and Dr. Miller to really attack the incredible increasing cost attributable to hepatitis C, think about where we would have been heading as a nation, and the decisions states, unions, employees, employers would have had to make regarding those costs and coverage and everything else attributable to it.","Our clients are looking for healthcare solutions. They are not \u2013 to be quite frank with you, they're not looking whether they should take a certain manufacturer's products or not, they're looking for somebody to give them guidance to say, how can I fill out my spectrum of offerings that I'm going to offer to my employees and make it cost-effective and clinically sound. And that's our job, is to make sure that we put together a list of products and services that allow our clients to meet their employees' needs, keep them safe and allow them access, and at the same time control costs.","The question of pharmacy really doesn't come into it. Most every deal we do has a requirement that there be certain access standards. The lower you want your costs, the more they're willing to bend that. The DoD is a perfect example, which we just recently renewed. And as you know, they have access standards, they don't require that any specific pharmacy be included as long as their members meet the access standards. Medicare is the same way. There is \u2013 you have to have a network that's going to meet specific standards. Now, you can deviate from that with the client support in order to drive down costs. And I think that's where we come in.","We can partner with CVS, we can partner with Walgreens, we can partner with Rite Aid, we can partner with the big box stores, we can do what it takes to meet our clients' geographic needs and at the same time meet their economic needs. And I think we're uniquely positioned to do that.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. And then just my follow up. I think, Jim, you talked about the metrics being the same, the 2% to 5% EBITDA growth. But can you help us understand what would get you towards the upper end of that 5% EBITDA growth versus the lower end of 2%?","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Sure. As you take a look at the range, you got to consider lots of different elements in there. One of the elements, of course, is mix of the claims; another is inflation; another one is how well we're able to execute on our supply chain. And we've done an outstanding job in the past. And lots of those benefits that we achieve early in the year are really realized in the later part of the year. All of those elements will contribute to an improved results, if you will, and get us near the higher end of that range.","Lisa C. Gill - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Robert M. Willoughby - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Thanks. The ASR does come with some deleveraging burden over the course of the year. Jim, is it possible to give us some insight how much of the $5.5 billion in debt you think you could take down? And then secondarily, does it affect your strategic focus whatsoever? You mentioned opportunities in the first quarter. Now, we see the ASR, our opportunities, in the third quarter and fourth quarter is still possible for you?","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, that's a good point. Maybe I should have mentioned that earlier. When we were done with this most recent debt agreement, we were up about 2.6 times. And we think by the end of the year we'll be right back down to, say, 2.1 times to 2.0 times. So it's going to take us really just about to the end of the year, maybe slightly into 2016 to get this all repaid and get it deleveraged. There is no penalties associated with paying that debt. That's the way it was set up and that was contemplated from the get-go.","In terms of any restrictions on our ability to move within the market, this really doesn't set us back at all. This is really a short-term transaction as I just described. So by the end of the year, we're back to exactly where we are in our comfort zone of 2.0 times. And as you know, any significant transactions clearly take time. And so this should not be any type of hindrance to us at all.","Robert M. Willoughby - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And George, you do have your Outcomes Symposium coming in May here. Can you give us any insights as to what's on the agenda there?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd be happy to do that. But why don't I turn it over to Dr. Miller who can specifically talk about our Outcomes Symposium and what's taking place?","Steven B. Miller - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, George. As you know, we have already said that cancer is one of our new focus areas. We know that this is actually one of the most sensitive areas for our clients, but I also want you to understand that this is actually going to be a much slower and much bigger efforts over time than what you saw, for instance, in hepatitis.","A cancer is different than any other disease, much more emotional, it's much more difficult to compare drugs, but we'll be announcing some new tools we'll have for our ability to work with our cancer patients, we'll also be able to announce some new associations we're having with others who are going to help us in this area. We're very optimistic that we can start making incremental moves in the area of cancer to control costs.","The other major focus, obviously, will continue to be other specialty areas. Specialty continues to be the fastest-growing area now in all of healthcare and we really have to help our clients and our patients get their hands around this, if we're going to control those costs over the next several years.","Robert M. Willoughby - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.","That's great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks for the questions. I guess just the first one on gross profit per script, up nicely in the quarter, 4% year-over-year. I guess just curious if you could dig in a little bit on the details of what was driving the gross profit per script? Maybe you can give us a sense of how much specialty might have contributed to the profitability there?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, let me chime in and then Jim you take it. But \u2013 you just hit the nail on the head. We've been talking about this for several quarters, several years. And what's happening is kind of a unique phenomenon, as specialty costs rise at an incredibly quick pace. And what it's doing is, although this is still less than 2% of our total scripts, the cost increases are so big, and the opportunities are so big for us that it allows us \u2013 you see it in the revenue per script as well.","Revenues per script is up, gross profit per script is up, and a lot of that's been driven by these specialty products and our ability to manage those, select the right one, and do what's in our best \u2013 in our clients' best interests.","The other thing, quite frankly, is just managing the overall supply chain and the overall solid side and making sure that our focus through, again, David Norton and Everett Neville that, that team really stays focused on making sure to protect our clients when you see manufacturers raising their rates at undue rates and trying to do what's best for our clients.","Jim, I don't know if you have anything you want to add.","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","I think George really nailed it. We don't disclose any kind of segment information, we really don't have segments. We are all in one big operation. But I will tell you that mix is terrifically important and that's where George emphasized. And the other emphasis we have, of course, is a real focus on expense control and that's both in terms of the way we operate the facilities and in the way that we buy the product. And so we're executing \u2013 as I mentioned earlier, we're out of the box pretty well for 2015 and we'll hopefully see that reflect in numbers going forward as well.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. And then I guess just a follow-up maybe for Dr. Miller. As we think about the work you guys have done around hep C and the associated rebates. Can you maybe give us a sense of how you're approaching other classes specifically? I know you guys have talked about PCSK9s. Maybe just a little bit more detail around the types of tools you have at your disposal there? And anything you see as far as related rebates or benefits that you could drive from that class as you did with hep C?","Steven B. Miller - Chief Medical Officer & Senior Vice President","I think the single largest thing we have going for us is a very loyal client base. When you look at what our clients did for us in empowering us to take on hepatitis C, it clearly was the single most important lever we have. We have the largest national formulary in the United States and pharmaceutical manufacturers really respect that.","The other thing is, is we actually have great relationships with these pharmaceutical manufacturers. We've been having great discussions with them over the last several months, including many presentations even by our management team in front of their Boards of Directors.","And so because of that, we really believe that, going forward, we have a much better relationship with them and they understand we are all about access. We really want to have our patients have access to the very best medications at the very best price. And so I think the most important tool, again comes back to our size. Our scale gives us the opportunity to do things that I think no one else can do.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Any context, Jim, on how we should think about this relative to the hep C opportunity?","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think you saw what it was able to do for us in hep C, but I think you're going to see the same types of negotiations going on with the PCSK9 inhibitors and we're going to expand that into other specialty categories, because the future is really all about specialty drugs.","If you saw a pharma's release, there is now 7,000 products in the pipeline. And we have to be able to manage those products, we have to give our patients access to the very best medications, but we have to get a competitive price, because otherwise the benefit is not sustainable.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","If I could just add, this is Tim. As Steve said, we've been in front of god-awful number of pharma company senior leaderships and boards in the last probably three months or so. And I got an email this morning from the Chairman of the Board of a very large specialty pharma company.","And the exact quote was, we need to engage with you well before we price and launch our next big drug. They clearly respect our point of view, they respect where our clients sit, and they are looking for us to help them drive safe, affordable access, while at the same time hitting their goals. And what we've proven in hep C and what we've proven in other categories is, we can do that.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. So guidance seems to suggest that SG&A reductions will build over the course of the year. Could you give us some color on the \u2013 what's driving the build, whether it's investment early in the year? And then also the relationship with the transaction and integration expense and work there, and how that work will begin to slow and where we might see benefit from the SG&A line?","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","The SG&A line is \u2013 that decline is just a result of focus. And what we really are trying to do is really recognize all the benefits of the combination of ESI and Medco and really say we've realized all the benefits \u2013 not all, but we've realized benefits for our clients, we've realized benefits for our patients, our customers, and now it's time to take a look and make sure we're as effective and as efficient as we can possibly be. So we're challenging virtually every line item in our SG&A, just as we talked about on Investor Day.","As we look forward through the rest of the year, we're going to see some improvement in SG&A, some continued improvement in SG&A. We're also going to see our integration costs come down. We had about $95 million in Q1. We gave guidance on about $250 million for the year. We feel good about that guidance. We will be in that neighborhood before the year is over. There'll be some in the second half, but most of it is front-end loaded in the first half of the year. So we hope to \u2013 we plan to see continued benefits. And as you know, when you make changes early in the year, most of that harvest is taken in the second half of the year.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And then by way of follow up, as you spoke about gross margin and the improvement this year and the addition of clients, is that trend elevated relative to prior years because there was a lower retention rate and more additions. Is that a multiple of prior years, or would you point to the last couple of years and have similar trends?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think this is \u2013 last couple of years really was a focus around keeping what we have while we went through a massive integration. And, quite frankly, we probably didn't do as good a job as we should have on the retention side. Our focus coming out of this year \u2013 we had -not to continue to bang \u2013 blow this horn, but we had just a great 1\/1. We hit it out of the ball park with our clients in delivering the services and the levels that they would have expected from us pre-integration. And I think that's part of what you're seeing in the SG&A reductions.","We're rationalizing our footprint across the company. And I think we also sold a lot of business towards the end of last year. We had some big renewals with the DoD and others and we're seeing the fruits of that coming in during the second half of the year. It's actually starting in this quarter, but predominantly in the second half of the year.","Eric R. Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yeah. Hi, good morning. My first question, George, is around the B2C model. So when you think about the PBM role to your point is really in delivering solutions for employers, but with the market moving very rapidly to the high deductible plan we're hearing more and more employers talking about and spending more on engagement tools. So how do you think about your strategy that relate to kind of like a B2C and kind of like the individuals or the consumers?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","So let me take that. Ricky, it's Tim. I mean \u2013 we obviously have been helping our clients manage plan designs that require much higher levels of engagement of the member. And I think early in the script we talked about seeing member as a patient, but that drives still a need to engage that patient and increasingly their caregivers differently.","So we've done everything from making it much easier for caregivers to have access to their \u2013 the persons for whom they're providing cares information by going to e-methods rather than other methods that existed before, but probably much more importantly is we are engaging in a complete redo of our digital web strategy.","As I've mentioned before, I've hired somebody who works directly for me who is driving the entire member experience piece for us to take it to a level that would be where today's consumers expect sort of their interactions with their most trusted companies to be.","And so we've got a very specific set of things that are in play. We're launching those iteratively over the next several years and that's not only to drive mail, it's also to help members find the lowest cost access for whatever product they're on, it's to help them find other things inside the healthcare spectrum that are related to their pharmacy care.","And we think over time, again, because of the real-time nature of pharmacy, we are in a perfect position to help these patients access the right care and understand things. Another piece to that, though, is these consumers are increasingly faced, even though they're wide open plans, with prior authorizations for example.","And so we're looking at how we execute prior authorizations to be far more patient friendly, far more physician friendly, far more real-time, so that we're able to actually help get that patient to the right medication quickly and keep them from the higher cost things that would happen if they weren't on that medication.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","So when you think about these \u2013 kind of like these new offerings, when will you be able to market it to your employers? Kind of like what's the timeline we're going to see that in the market or in the selling season?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you would see already that we work with literally hundreds of our employers who are using, in many cases, full replacement or certainly as an option for their employees CDH. But we do real-time debiting and crediting across the platform that they would be on and so forth. And importantly, every one of our health plans, we're engaged with them as they go out to their marketplaces and sell into the consumer marketplace both in the marketplace itself and to self-insured employers who want to have, what you call a cafeteria or a private exchange, you call it whatever you want.","The bottom line is, again, we're there because what's been seen in the earlier days of this is has been the service that we're able to provide to those members which is the most used part of the benefit and the most real-time part of the benefit is really critical in having our scale and our ability to invest has been what's driven those employers' confidence to frankly shift some of that risk to those employees, and at the same time know that they're not going to be dissatisfied with the benefits. So we're out there right now helping employers solve this challenge.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then in the prepared remarks, I think, you mentioned that you're seeing that interest levels have kind of like tripled in terms of RFP activity. Where are you seeing that interest coming? Is it from clients that are currently with other PBMs or is this coming from clients that have carved in the PBM and are looking to carve it out now?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're seeing it across the board. It's not from any one source. As you can imagine, there are some dynamics that are going on right now in the marketplace with some M&A that have occurred, which has probably opened up a few more doors. Although we had a lot of those doors already opened this year, we were confident that we were going to get a look at a lot of things this year relative to what was out there and we've seen that. But I wouldn't tell you it's coming from any one place.","Certainly, the opportunities that are out there, as we look at them, are not just from the big two or three but from a very competitive industry of many PBMs who \u2013 some of the smaller ones struggle with their scale to provide the level of service that their clients need today and we're seeing some of that opportunity as well.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Garen Sarafian from Citi Research. You may ask your question.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good morning, everyone. I wanted to touch on retention rate. You reiterated your confidence in the rate, but the low-end still seems a bit lower than a normal year. So is there anything in particular that remains this year? Or is it just a level of conservatism after last year, just trying to get a better handle on the low-end of the range?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll start then Tim certainly should chime in here but I think there's a little misunderstanding about retention rates, and I've said this on this call for the last probably 10 years. And that is, to me, if you sell at 100% you've not done your job. Anybody can sell at 100%. That means you're giving it away. I mean, your product has to have value. I never want to go into a deal and find out I had the best price, because then all you're doing is you're not really selling, you're just pushing a commoditized product. We think we have a differentiated product. We think we have a product that makes a difference to our patients and our members, and our clients, and so we want to drive. And so I do think between M&A activities and between just normal client turnover, there's always going to be some number.","I think if we can hit 95% to 97% each and every year, we'd be really happy with that. Does that mean I want to be at 95%? No. I would prefer we get to 97%. I prefer clients understand and value what we're bringing them. I think this year, based on our very good strong service opening \u2013 we started the year in a strong manner, but we're still right now in the throes of the commercial side of the business retention.","A lot of the opportunities that are out there still relate to 2016 on the really big stuff. So we're working our way through this. It's too early to give any specificity as to where the year is going to turn out, but keep in mind we count retention by script count. So we've got some very large accounts and we may lose one or two of those and it can make a huge impact on the retention rate as long as you're counting it by script counts. So we're not in a position to give a firm number, but we do feel very good about where we sit today.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Yeah, I mean, I would just add. There are still several \u2013 I know you know that stuff tends to \u2013 the big stuff tends to trade early. There are still several meaningful cases, so we're taking nothing for granted. We are in excellent conversations. We are very confident in our range and increasingly confident at the high end of that range, but today it would not be responsible for us to say anything other than that, because our heads are down and we are working with those remaining opportunities to close them up. And again, we're in a very good place there, but we are taking nothing for granted.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Got it. No, that's very useful. And then just changing gears a little bit, one of your retail partners a few weeks back at Investor Day stated that Smart90 was performing quite well. So under the current agreement that you have, could you maybe comment on what you're seeing in terms of the offering, the quality of the scripts from the product on your end, and maybe what type of feedback that you're getting from prospects or current clients to enhance future versions of it?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Tim you can certainly chime in here. But just from my perspective, the Smart90 is a very important offering for us because it does give us a 90-day option at retail. I think from a client perspective, some of them are very very \u2013 want access and they want to be able to meet the other offerings in the marketplace. Other clients don't really care, but I do think that to the extent that Walgreens has stepped up and has been a good partner with us on the Smart90, we've got some very satisfied clients. We continually work with them to try to make sure that we could advance that ball forward and we're happy with the relationship.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Yeah. I've got nothing to add. I would agree. I mean, it's certainly not been a bow wave of interest, but those clients for whom \u2013 it is something they want, it's worked very well. It works well for us. We've demonstrated that both \u2013 you save clients' money, you increase retail share to the preferred provider and you increase mail. And so \u2013 and that's how the client wins. It works well.","What we've got is obviously a very strong book of clients who have \u2013 particularly on the employer side, who have already got high mail penetration and we see little to no interest in sort of opening it up for those populations, because they're very satisfied with the results that they're getting there.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I guess the essence of the question was just the balance between mail going to the retail channel versus retail 30 going to essentially retail 90. If that's a balance that you guys are comfortable with now, or are there different iterations to come?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, quite frankly, if it goes from retail 30 to either mail or to mail 90, we're really doing our job, because that is a tremendous savings to our client. Depending on the client, it could be anywhere from 800 basis points to 1,000 basis points price reduction and a co-pay savings for the members.","So those moves are very, very good and we try to promote that, both within our Smart90 program and within our mail programs to take those medications that should be taken on a regular basis for the rest of your life and try to convert them into these 90-day programs, because that's going to be the best savings, it's shown to be better for \u2013 to make sure the member stays compliant with their drug regimens as well as driving down costs. So we 100% endorse that.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","I'll stop there. Thanks for the questions.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. You may ask your question.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Just to follow-up on the prior question. It seems like your mail claims performance has been better the last three quarters or four quarters versus retail. Can you talk about if there are any specific programs that are driving that? And I think at Analyst Day you talked about a new interface for home delivery for members. Can you give us an update on when that will get rolled out?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Again, we're not big banging some new mail rollout. What we're doing is, we are iterating with some significantly focused leadership that we've brought in from the outside that are very deeply understanding our member experience.","We co-located software developers now and are doing real-time iterative software development around our digital experience based on members' feedback. That sounds like a lot of words. What it really means is, we are constantly now looking in making the digital experience better.","The good news about that is, we have high levels of penetration in digital and we're getting higher. And the higher we get with that, the better we get in terms of the things that our clients \u2013 or our patients then respond to in the way that we're able to work with them.","And so really it's no one thing, but we have dramatically reengineered the underlying performance of the web and the digital interface, we've re-launched \u2013 we're about to re-launch again the front-end of the website, which is based on a lot of research, our digital experience continues to be developed and evolved. And so it's literally a ground game of improvement rather than a single big bang, waiting for the sort of the big bang to come. And what we're hearing from members is real clear, which is they really like the changes that we're making, the improvements that we're making, because they're comparing us to, again, the Amazons and the Apples.","And one of those things we have going for us, frankly, is \u2013 for example, a member gets a lot more information about where their script is in the process today than they would have a year ago. And that's an information that not only saves us money by avoiding phone calls from members who frankly didn't want to call us to ask that question anyway. But we're able to repurpose that money into improving the digital experience which only makes a high degree of loyalty from that patient.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And, Tim, one other question. In Analyst Day, I think, you talked about some new formulary management tools like compliance guarantees and inflation ceilings. Can you give us a sense about how much uptick you're getting from clients there? And are those being used just exclusively in the specialty class at this point?","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Those were specifically attributable to hepatitis C where \u2013 well, actually to be fair, our National Preferred Formulary has inflation caps across a very significant percentage of the products supported by the majority of the manufacturers. That continues. And our clients have seen the benefit of improved rebates by virtue of, where manufacturers have inflated drug pricing over caps, our clients got that money back in terms of their rebates. So that's across the book of business. And that's why we've had such stickiness in our National Preferred Formulary, it is only growing, we haven't seen clients leaving it as they've had experience with it.","But as it relates to hep C, what we've seen as well in terms of cure guarantee is, we are not paying out, it's early days still, but what we are seeing is that our specialist pharmacists at Accredo are \u2013 which is how the clients access that guarantee are driving incredibly high adherence to the product. And therefore, our anticipation is, right now we are under what our assumptions would have been in terms of patients falling off care. Dr. Miller is nodding his head at the end of the table, which is good news, because that's the data I've seen.","Here's the question clients are asking frankly. We just had 21 of our largest clients offsite, they were asking how do we get those same dynamics and how can we help you and give you our patients and have that in the PCSK9s or maybe even more broadly in the cardiovascular category. So we see the clients taking sort of our idea and working with us shoulder to shoulder to actually expand it into, again these very large patient populations who are going to be accessing increasingly costly or inflating cures.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Very good. Thank you.","Operator","Thanks. Our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good morning and thanks for taking the question. I guess, George just a brief one on the, I'll say on the, strategic review or the strategic opportunity and the share repo. Safe to assume that that's an opportunity from your opinion that's kind of come and gone, and hence the not deployment of capital in share one and the ASR? So there's kind of nothing else on the near-term that you guys are evaluating with respect to the transaction opportunities?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, that's not right. Well, I think what Jim said and \u2013 chime in here again, Jim, if I don't get this right. But the idea here is we had a plan to buy shares in the first quarter and throughout the course of the year which was going to meet the guidance we gave at the beginning of the year.","We set out the first quarter and we decided, based on where we're at today that we thought it was opportunistic in the best interest of our shareholders to execute an ASR to meet our commitment, our forecast to hit our numbers by executing this in the second quarter. Because we delevered so fast, we're not actually buying more shares than we normally would have anyway. We're buying up what we would have used our free cash flow for. I think you've heard me on this call say, to the extent we don't use our cash to either invest in ourselves or to do strategic opportunities, we're going to return it to our shareholders, we're committed to that.","And so what we wanted to do is show that commitment and get this done in the second quarter, execute on the ASR, and then by the end of the year we're back to where we were before we started, or close to it. And that gives us all the financial freedom we need.","Any deal of any size that we can't just pay for out of current cash flow or off of our revolver is going to be big enough deal that's going to take time to execute, go through a process, which means by the time we finish that process, we will be back down to where we were and we'll be in a strategic opportunity to use our cash or do what we need to do to meet our strategic needs.","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","The only think I would add to what George said is that, we will \u2013 we will \u2013 we don't stop evaluating opportunities, we're constantly taking a look at how we can enhance our value proposition. So as George pointed out, merely because we have this and we've decided to align or to take in one transaction, align our capital structure for 2015 that doesn't stop our processes.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's fair enough. And then maybe a quick follow-up, EBITDA prescript, George, continues to expand nicely. And I don't know if George or Jim wants to comment on is? I wanted to know if you could just talk about \u2013 if you were to rank order where the pressures are on the business, if I were to think about it, I would probably think renewal pricing pressure is number one, maybe price check pressure is number two, pressure on the regular way services part of the book of business is number three; I guess if you were to talk about over the next couple years kind of sources of pressure and opportunities for margin expansion, kind of how would you rank order them? And I'll jump off. Thank you.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, there's \u2013 let me try to address this and Jim you can certainly chime in or, Tim, you as well. There's always headwinds and tailwinds and that's part of the budgeting and forecasting process.","So as you know, we renewed the Department of Defense contract, that's baked into our numbers for this year. That comes up every five years to seven years \u2013 so many years depending on what they do with their option years. And so there is a renewal pressure of that coming through the numbers this year, which puts margin pressure in place. In addition to that, we have our normal renewals and those checks on pricing what have you put pressure. The other side of it, though, is that there is a tremendous amount of activity taking place in the new drug launches, new drug discoveries, and generic conversions that are occurring.","All those things are tremendous tailwinds. And so it's a question of how do you capture those tailwinds to offset those margin pressures, meet the needs for our shareholders versus through growth, at the same time make sure that we can manage down the costs for our clients. And that's that balancing act which is critically important. I guess the long and short of it is, is that because of the tools that we have and because of the actions we take, we can extract more value out of the supply chain and take advantage of the environmental actions that are taking place around us to more than offset the demands that are facing us in the marketplace. And I think the only way you can do that is if you're delivering value to your clients.","With the big increases in price on specialty utilization increases, and as Dr. Miller said 7,000 new drug launches, I think there is tremendous opportunity out there for us to continue to grow and to meet our clients' needs and expectations.","Jim Havel - Executive Vice President & Interim Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I agree with everything George said and I guess I would echo it and then say that we can only control what we can control. We can't control pricing out there. But what we can do is provide such great service that frankly the customers just plain don't want to leave us and it takes a heck of a differential for them to make a decision like that.","Similarly, we can't control all the cost out there, but we can control the cost in our own house and we can set our own cost structure up that we can make sure we maintain \u2013 very competitive statute within the industry. And the work that we've done in the supply chain, I think, has been terrific and the work that Dr. Miller talked about in terms of helping the industry at large also differentiates us and, again, gives us, I think, a competitive advantage.","So those types of things, I don't know that we rank any of those things in terms of the pressures we face, but I think if we close our eyes to one, we're going to always be surprised by another and that just isn't the right answer.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Yeah. Just to keep piling on here. I do think that this is a very complex part of our business and part of our forecasting model is to look at what do we think that's going to happen from an inflation utilization and perspective. And what new drug launches are going to take place and what effects are those going to have. If it's a new drug that goes into a therapeutic class for which there isn't a lot of competition. To Jim's point, we can't really do much about the price there. That's just going to happen and we're going to have to deal with it. We're going to have to try to manage those trends to best of our abilities.","What we do, do is put clinical programs around it, so that we'll make sure that the drug is being prescribed for its intended and best uses, and not being used just because it's a new drug or for other reasons than intended, which could then dramatically drive up the cost.","The other side to that, though, is if it's a new drug launch or it's an additional drug launch into a therapeutic class that either adds or puts more competition into a space, even though those costs may come out high, the mere fact that we have that competition then gives us the tools to go in and really manage those costs. At the beginning of the year we do our best to determine where all those influences and opportunities exist, but over the course of the year, quite frankly, things happen. And usually those things are beneficial and we take advantage of them, but sometimes they can be negative and we do our \u2013 that's why we give ranges.","George R. Hill - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. You may ask your question.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Hi. Can you please talk about your relationship with Anthem? I'm sure you guys have a very good relationship with them. I think you're about five years into a 10-year deal. They've been talking publicly about extracting some incremental dollars from their PBM activities. Can you just give some comments on that, please? Thanks.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We don't really like to talk about client-specific situations. I mean, we've got lots and lots of clients. Anthem has been an incredibly important client to us. And I think we do very good things together. So we really enjoy that relationship, we really enjoy providing services to their members. It's a \u2013 they provide healthcare benefits to our employees. We have 30,000 plus employees. We're grateful for that part of the relationship. And so I do think it's a two-way street. I really don't want to get into the particulars around the contract though and what's taking place \u2013 we don't want to do that with any client. So I'd just as soon stay away from that.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Okay. I'm sorry. Go ahead.","David M. Larsen - Leerink Partners LLC","No. I was just going to say thanks a lot.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Okay. Sure. I think there is only one more question in the queue, so if we could go ahead and take that.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ross Muken with Evercore. You may ask your question.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. I just want to get back to kind of the big picture theme of the day. And so I think you kind of clearly stated obviously you're very confident sort of in the long-term premise of the PBM model. And it seems like you've got more momentum this year. But you also started off talking about the history here and you guys obviously have always been very good at M&A and have a long successful history of it. So you kind of obviously don't sound as enthusiastic about the combo retail model for you, it works for others, and so that's understandable and there's obviously other models.","But as we think about what you've done historically, it's either been scale-based or it's been capabilities and you're already quite big and you've got a lot of capabilities. So if you're thinking about something more sizable, what is the sort of criteria, or how do you think about what other types of things we may not think of that would make sense for Express Scripts long-term in kind of the mission of what you're doing around the traditional PBM? I'm just trying to think about how you guys now view the more larger scale stuff, which was a part of the core, given we've kind of eliminated a fair amount of sort of the obvious opportunities?","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Tim, you should certainly feel free to chime in here. But I would tell you that we're excited about where we sit. I think when you look at what's taking place in the market today and you see what just happened with hepatitis C, it gets all the press, but at the end of the day we've been doing this for our existence. We've been taking on drug manufacturers across the board for years, taking on retail drugstores for years, because of \u2013 trying to make sure that we're putting our interests aligned with our clients to drive the best possible economic and health outcomes for our membership. That's what we do.","I think we've said on the call or maybe Dr. Miller said one-time at an Outcomes conference or something that \u2013 if you look at what's happened over the last 10-years, and more importantly, what's happened with the hepatitis C drug if PBMs didn't exist, venture capital would have formed one to attack this issue. That doesn't go away just because people are merging and there is opportunities. The problem with the world is you need scale, you need size, you need to be able to influence outcomes. We're happy with where we sit from a PBM perspective. We are constantly, constantly looking for opportunities in the marketplace. Yes, big scale deals get notoriety and they can make huge differences, but it's just not that.","To think about what our services are, as you think about an HR department and the challenges they face each and every day across the board with all the different offerings that are inside the company and the employee needs that they have, drug costs and medical costs and the benefits and the different challenges they face are the things that are within our focus. We want to help them do their jobs better. We want to sit down and \u2013 Tim said last week, we had 22 of the Fortune, I guess they're all probably Fortune 200, Fortune 100 companies at an off-site with us and what we do is we sit down with them. And these aren't lower level people, these are all very high influential people in very large corporations, that we sit down and have very \u2013 several day conversation around what are the challenges they're facing. And our job is to listen to those challenges, figure out what's in our sweet spot, what's in our core competencies, and then roll out offerings and opportunities and solutions for them.","I'm not against doing $100 million or $200 million or $300 million transaction that we can grow into be something that our clients need and be an integral part of our offering. Likewise, I'm not against doing a mega billion dollar deal if it makes sense for our clients and it makes sense for our shareholders and it's going to be accretive and value-additive across the board for our patients, our clients and our shareholders.","So I think we're very open to looking at opportunities that make sense. We don't just willy-nilly do deals, but do things that make a difference. And quite frankly, having said all that, through our career we've done a lot of transactions and we've kind of rolled up a lot of this industry, but through all that we've actually added lots of clients to our stable base. Selling and retention is a critical part of who we are as well. And to do that, you've got to keep a \u2013 you've got to continue to refresh your offering and make sure we stay relevant in the marketplace and it's clearly a focus of ours.","Timothy C. Wentworth - President","Yeah, I mean, I think the only thing I'd add, Ross, is that, being as close to our clients as we are, you begin to see opportunities that may not be as obvious, not only to invest in your core, which we don't talk a lot about investing in our core, but investing in our core is critical. But also in terms of different populations of patients and their needs, the use of data and so forth, I would remind you that we actually have a fairly significant pharma services business, but we think there's a lot more that we can do there that helps keep drugs safe, bring them to market, bring biosimilars to market, keep them safe when they're in the market.","We have a workers' comp business that we like that we think there are more things that we can do there. So it's definitely not always going to be a big bang, but we are very active right now. And the good news is we're able to focus on our clients and result of that, then focus on the opportunities that those relationships we have may either enable or be made better by.","Ross Muken - Evercore ISI","Thanks, gentlemen. Appreciate the color.","George Paz - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate everyone joining us this morning for first quarter conference call and earnings and we look forward to talking to you throughout the course of the year.

Today's call is being recorded. If anyone has any objections, you may disconnect.","I would now like to turn the call over to Ben Bier, Vice President of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Benjamin Bier - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, and good morning. With me today are Tim Wentworth, CEO and President, and Eric Slusser, EVP and CFO.","Before we begin, I need to read the following safe harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in the company's most-recent form 10K and form 10Q, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update or otherwise release publically any revisions to our forward-looking statements. For clarity purposes, all financial numbers, except where indicated, that we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis and are attributable to Express Scripts excluding non-controlling interest representing the share allocated to members of our consolidated affiliates.","This presentation will be posted on our website and includes an appendix with the footnotes and the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.express-scripts.com. At this point, I will turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, Ben and good morning everyone. This morning, I want to address our recent disclosure related to Anthem. We will discuss the contribution that Anthem along with our transitioning clients, namely Coventry and Catamaran, have on our business and how the core PBM is performing excluding them.","We'll also discuss why we are excited about the outlook for our core PBM and how we are well-positioned to achieve strong results as a focused, independent PBM in 2017 and well beyond. Our discussion will also include an update on 2017 selling season. Then Eric will review our financial results for the first quarter and updated 2017 full-year outlook.","As you saw in our release yesterday, Anthem recently told us that they intended to move their business when our contract with them expires at the end of 2019. Although we are under no obligation to do so, we disclosed the financial contribution of the Anthem business to Express Scripts. We did so voluntarily to bring greater visibility to our core business and remove uncertainty that has existed about Anthem's business.","As we have stated and is now clearly evidence, we do not have $3 billion in savings to give Anthem from pricing concessions alone. This is the point we've made since the figure was first stated by Anthem in January of 2016, at a time when we actually had earned less than $2 billion on Anthem's business the prior year.","Though Anthem has made continuous demands for price concessions, they ignore completely the $4.7 billion of value they received in 2009 when Express Scripts purchased Anthem's then government-sanctioned PBM, NextRX. They also ignore the unique which accompanied it","Despite Express Scripts recommendation in 2009 to enter into a more traditional pricing arrangement with less up front dollars, Anthem's management at the time elected to take and use these funds to buy back shares instead of accepting more competitive pricing and contract terms. The decision to accept the pricing and contract terms they currently have, and the $4.7 billion up-front payment was their choice, and we believe it is worth mentioning that at the time, Anthem publically stated that their pharmacy costs were going down as a result of entering into the 10-year agreement with Express Scripts.","Now, with each passing day, Anthem is foregoing additional price concessions of as much as $1 billion annually that we are willing to provide. And as it should be clear today the annual rate relief of $3 billion which they have been so adamant to receive simply isn't something we can offer.","That said, we are the only PBM that can provide Anthem with pharmacy savings between now and 2020. We are also the only solution that avoids the need to transition Anthem's clients and members to an in-house PBM or another PBM, a significant undertaking, requiring hundreds of millions of dollars in investment and creating unnecessary risk and some level of disruption for patients and clients.","As some of you may know, it took three years to bring Anthem's business on to Express Scripts platform starting in 2009.","With or without Anthem, our strategy, independent business model, and unique solutions collectively position us for a strong future. Our national preferred formulary, the nation's largest with 25 million members, none of whom are from Anthem, give us unrivalled supply chain leverage. Excluding Anthem, our diverse client base represents over 65 million members, and we will have a volume of more than 1 billion prescriptions annually.","Over the next two and a half years or longer, while we continue to serve Anthem and its members, we will focus on using the value that we are willing to give them to thoughtfully position our core business for the future.","As you saw in our earnings press release, we've elected to provide information as to the financial performance of our business with and without Anthem and the other transitioning clients in order to demonstrate that the company's core PBM business excluding Anthem is well-positioned for future growth.","In 2016, the core PBM business processed nearly 1.2 billion adjusted claims, representing growth of 2.2% excluding Anthem and our transitioning clients, and earned $4.8 billion in adjusted EBITDA representing growth of 6.2% over 2015 adjusted EBITDA.","Our core PBM growth in 2016 was largely attributable to the rapid adoption of our SafeGuardRX suite of solutions, patent expirations on several drugs with significant branded revenue, a renegotiated agreement with Walgreens and lower SG&A spending.","As you may recall, in 2016, we reduced our clients' drug trend from 5.2% to 3.8%, or 27%, saving clients billions of dollars. Our 2016 core results clearly demonstrate that in years when we have the opportunity to create competition to drive down costs and ensure patient access, we also benefit, highlighting the power of our model of alignment.","In addition to the growth in our core PBM, a large portion of the reduction in EBITDA from our transitioning clients was offset by growth in EBITDA attributable to Anthem business. Anthem's EBITDA growth in 2016 was largely driven by the addition of Amerigroup lives onto the ESI platform and incremental volume from their healthcare exchange business. Notably, the $1.9 billion in EBITDA attributable to Anthem is obviously quite a bit lower than the $3 billion figure they publically claimed in January 2016 that they should be paid.","Eric will provide more detail on the company's consolidated results in a few moments, but I want to highlight that based on our prior guidance, we're targeting consolidated Express Scripts EBITDA growth of 1% to 3% in 2017.","Turning to the longer-term, our independent model uniquely positions us to grow our core business over the long-term. Our flexibility, agility and laser focus on pharmacy makes us the only PBM fully aligned with our clients' best interests as we protect them against the impact of skyrocketing drug prices. When you look at the dynamics in the health care market, over the next five to 10 years, our role will be more important than ever. Our market-leading assets, relentless innovation, and unique alignment with clients make us an attractive option for payers who truly want to change the dynamics of medicine affordability and access.","Our unmatched expertise and focus on supply chain management, specialty pharmacy and member experience, particularly in the 90-day retail and mail channels, will drive to lower unit cost at a time when payers need solutions more than ever.","In specialty in particular, we not only rein in costs, but greatly improve care, making sure that every patient gets the most out of their medicine. Our Accredo specialized care model sets us apart and puts us well ahead of our competition.","And beyond specialty, for those patients who may be challenged because they are uninsured, underinsured or in high deductible health plans, we have new solutions coming soon to address those specific needs and will generate value beyond what is already available.","The future holds significant new opportunities for all of our levers to drive solid growth. For example, we believe there will be a more active FDA which will approve more medicines and generate greater competition in the marketplace and no one leverages competition better than we do.","Beyond unit cost management, our focused clinical tools, including our TRC powered SafeGuardRx suite of solutions, position us to create value-based opportunities to deliver great value to patients and clients. We can generate additional value as new drugs are approved, as biosimilars come to market, and as manufacturers increasingly step-up to deliver value beyond purchase price reduction.","As I have said before, we are bringing value-based care to life and we will continue to drive this trend. In fact, just last week on CNBC, the head of PhRMA pointed to working with PBMs as the way his members were looking to bring value-based arrangements to the marketplace. I couldn't agree more.","Finally, a strong core is built not just on creating and making the most of external opportunities but also by managing internal costs and investments to ensure a highly efficient lean approach. We have proven over the years that we can do this. It is a hallmark of Express Scripts. We have several significant initiatives underway to increase efficiency, further reduce our cost base and generate more opportunities to invest in further automation and technology solutions. Areas which will transform our company and what we offer to patients and our clients.","As I noted earlier, our SafeGuardRx solutions, along with our broader TRC-powered clinical toolset, help patients and clients manage pharmacy with a focus on optimal health outcomes at the lowest possible cost. While 2016 was a banner year for launching these programs and enrolling our clients in these powerful solutions, we continue to evolve them and add additional approaches this year and going forward. These solutions not only drive outcomes \u2013 look no further, frankly, than our drug trend results for that \u2013 but create significant reason for clients to stay with us and prospects to consider us.","As I look out at the landscape, it is clear our patients, clients and prospects need a partner who is relentlessly focused on health outcomes and cost containment. Our innovation will serve to protect them against tomorrow's health care challenges and create opportunities for them to benefit as the market evolves.","In that context, we are very pleased with our client retention thus far during the selling and renewal season. While it is still somewhat early, we anticipate another strong year, with a 2018 retention rate of 95% to 98% of Coventry scripts that are rolling off due to acquisition. Our renewals are balanced across both our health plan and commercial books.","Now from a selling perspective, this is a somewhat lighter than average year due to a number of meaningful opportunities being pushed into 2019, given the uncertainty of health care reform. However, we are actively engaged with prospects who are interested in the strength of our innovative aligned model.","I will now turn it over to Eric to discuss our first quarter 2017 results.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, Tim, and good morning. Yesterday, we reported first quarter adjusted earnings per share of $1.33, which represents an increase of 9% over last year. Our adjusted claims for the quarter were $351.7 million, above the midpoint of our guidance range. We also generated $1.5 billion of EBITDA, resulting in EBITDA per adjusted claim of $4.25, up 4% from the prior year.","In the first quarter, there were also approximately $24 million of one-time items that impacted our adjusted SG&A expense, primarily attributable to severance and legal fees.","Excluding the impact from Anthem and our transitioning clients, our core PBM EBITDA grew 50 basis points in the first quarter. We expect growth in our core PBM to ramp up in the remainder of the year as we realize higher utilization of our SafeGuardRx programs throughout the year, and increased penetration of generics in our book of business, as well as the timing of supply chain initiatives and higher Medicare Part D revenue, driven by the benefit design and reinsurance payments from the government.","From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1 billion of net cash flow from operations. We also repurchased 13.3 million shares for approximately $900 million during the quarter. Share repurchases were made through a combination of open market purchases and a 10b5-1 plan.","Now let's turn to 2017. We continue to expect 2017 adjusted claims to come in at the midpoint of $1.4 billion, generating an expected EBITDA in the range of $7.3 billion to $7.5 billion, up 2% at the midpoint over 2016 adjusted EBITDA.","We are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share range of $6.82 to $7.02, to $6.90 to $7.04, representing growth of 8% to 10% at the midpoint of the range. The increase in guidance is attributed to our focus on tax planning strategies and the management of our capital structure. We now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 575 million to 595 million. Our diluted share range reflects that our 10b-5 plan will end in July.","With respect to the second quarter of 2017, we expect adjusted earnings per share to be in the range of $1.70 to $1.74, up 8% to 11% year-over-year. Consistent with recent years, we expect to receive certain revenues related to the structure of our Anthem contract to be realized in the second quarter. We expect this amount to be approximately 50% less than the 2016 payment of approximately $107 million.","Finally, I want to touch on how we're focusing on our long-term financial framework. Although we're not prepared to provide specific long-term adjusted earnings per diluted share guidance, based on internal assumptions regarding healthcare trends, industry positioning, and the overall environment, we are excited about the future of our core PBM. For the period from 2017 through 2020, we're targeting a compounded annual EBITDA growth rate of 2% to 4% for the core PBM.","In addition, this earnings growth should continue to generate significant cash flows from operations. Aside from gradually paying down debt, our capital deployment strategies remain the same, funding internal growth, making strategic acquisitions, and returning cash to our shareholders.","To achieve our targeted leverage targets, we anticipate we will use approximately 30% of our annual cash flow from operations between now and 2020 for debt reduction. We remain committed to maintaining our strong investment-grade rating.","Finally, the healthcare landscape is fraught with inefficiencies, and we continue to search for strategic acquisitions that will enhance our core, as well as provide additional services to payers, patients, and our clients.","I'll now turn the call back over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thanks, Eric. Briefly, before we begin Q&A, I simply want to reinforce four important things.","First, in 2009, we offered Anthem lower rates, but instead they chose more value upfront. The Anthem truly represents a one-of-a-kind client and contract. Second, Anthem has demanded $3 billion per year in price concessions, and as you have seen today, that type of savings is simply not available. Third, we are the only PBM that can provide rate relief to Anthem before 2020, and then give them market-leading rates post 2020, and we are frankly surprised they are uninterested in capturing that value.","Finally, and most importantly, our solutions are in demand, and our work has never been more important. With or without Anthem, we remain well-positioned for future growth and to lead the way to more affordable access to medicine.","Thank you. And, operator, we'll now open it up for questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from Lisa Gill of JPMorgan. Your line is open.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Thanks very much, and good morning. Tim, let me start with my first question which would be around client flight risk. In talking to investors last night and this morning, it appears that people are thinking back to when Medco lost some clients, and then you obviously announced you were going to merge with Express Scripts. I viewed that as more of the merger versus the loss of clients, but can you maybe just spend a couple of minutes talking about how you're thinking about potential loss of any client, or any changes in the negotiation with your current client base?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure, Lisa, and good morning. Thanks for the question. So let me start with, our clients understand that the contract we have with Anthem, as I just said, is dramatically different. The up-front money that they demanded in 2009 and the contract that also followed it, specifically the market check language in that contract, which is very different, or the periodic market review language, as it's called in the contract. So our clients understand that.","As you can imagine, we haven't just started talking to them about this this year. Anthem has been out for quite a period of time. They filed a lawsuit a year ago now. And we have a strong playbook in terms of how we talk with clients. And I can tell you very quickly, the conversation pivots to, okay, let's talk about what you can do for me in terms of drug trend, in terms of programs, and so forth.","I think the Medco situation was very different due to a few things that I won't detail now, but suffice it to say we have a strong relationship with our clients. The feedback I've had, and I've obviously spoken with a few already, has been extraordinarily supportive. And you know, quite frankly, if Anthem isn't interested in receiving $3 billion over the next three years that would be tremendously valuable to them, we're going to invest that as well into the core of this business and drive our solutions even further and faster. And I think our clients are going to benefit directly from that, and that's what I'm sharing with them.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","And then if I can just, maybe just a couple points of clarification here. When we talk about the EBITDA attributable to Anthem, I just want to make sure that we understand that EBITDA is all-inclusive of all the benefit that you're getting around \u2013 for example, I know they're not on your national formulary, but you're probably purchasing on their behalf or negotiating on their behalf, right? And so there's probably some benefit within the EBITDA there. And so as we think about that, number one, I'd want to confirm that.","And then secondly, how do we think about the run-rate over the next couple of years? There was a nice jump from 2015 to 2016, and I think that was, again, due to the incremental contracting of what you're doing out in the marketplace around pharmaceutical costs. But I just want to understand those two factors; all-inclusive on the EBITDA line, and then secondly, as we think about the run-rate over the next couple of years, should we see an incremental step-up in 2017, 2018, 2019?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So let me start, and I'll let Eric add any color. First of all, let me say this as simply as I know how to. If Anthem were to leave today, the EBITDA that we've showed you \u2013 we would have work to do, first of all, obviously, which is the work we're doing, as I talked about, costs. But we would not see the EBITDA attributable to the core decrease because of some lost leverage that we would be gaining by virtue today, by virtue of having Anthem.","Let me say it a different way, and you kind of said it. They don't participate in our national preferred formulary. We will have 25 million members who we take to the table when we negotiate with pharma. Not one of those is an Anthem member. That will continue.","So they've gone, you know, we've supported them, they've gained our scale and our ability to contract at scale. They've gained from that, but I can tell you from the broad book of business, that's not the case. And so our EBITDA on the core is very much what you would expect going forward.","As it relates to \u2013 and by the way, the other piece is obviously in our mail service and GPO leverage, Anthem is not particularly high mail, and our ability to negotiate with generic manufacturers, remember, we're still at over 1.2 billion prescriptions overall, we still have a strong mail service franchise and 90-day franchise generally, our ability to negotiate there will not be diminished by virtue of Anthem's 200 million claims.","As it relates to the run-rate, what I would just say is, listen, Anthem, as you saw, and I assume you mean the run-rate for Anthem, Anthem has grown. And I would expect over the next three years as they put in programs that we've \u2013 they've been working with us to put in programs to drive down pharmacy costs, we benefit when those programs are put in and so do they. So I would expect to and I frankly hope to grow Anthem's profitability and EBITDA over the next three years as we put solutions in and as we continue to use our their behalf, separately from our book of business.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Quickly, do you expect that that's going to grow materially? You're talking about 1% to 3% this year, kind of 2% to 4% on a core run rate basis. When we think about the Anthem business and the 14% growth you saw last year, would you think that that's kind of growth or would you say it's probably going to be more in line with the Express overall growth? I think that from an investment perspective, people are just trying to get an idea of where this will be when you exit the relationship in 2019?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I would expect that what you should see is kind of what you've seen with our core, which is it will be more in line with \u2013 you know, the EBITDA any given year is a function of, even in this contract, a function of how much opportunity does the supply chain sort of have in terms of creating competition? Whether that's going and renegotiated rebates because new products come out, whether that's putting in programs, whether that's new generics, et cetera. And so, I would anticipate, while we aren't going to give forward-looking guidance on just Anthem, it's probably going to perform similar to what we've said for the core.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan","Okay, I'll stop there, thank you.","Operator","Thank you, the next question comes from Robert Willoughby of Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, Tim and Eric, can you speak to the 2% to 4% EBITDA CAGR that you're throwing out there? What are assumptions around new business in terms of a driver of that?","And then just secondarily, I think the story is more predicated on you getting the capital deployed productively over the next few years on deals. Can you help us, Tim, I know you've had some kind of high level guidelines for kinds of things that are interesting, but isn't it more critical now to offer a bit more granularity on the kinds of capabilities that might help you fill any Anthem hole that does materialize.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure, so I'll take first \u2013 the contribution of new business is, is a component, but I would not say it's the driving component, Robert. As you know, when we win new business, it's typically, you know, less-penetrated than the things that are valuable to us and over a series of years we penetrate it better. Now I will tell you, retention continues to be a key goal of ours, and in making sure we invest in solutions that maintain the value we create for clients. And so \u2013 but we also do target winning new business. And we think over the next three years we anticipate that we will add materially to our client base, but I would also tell you that winning at all costs is not only not required, it's not the strategy. And so we intend to compete well in the new sales space. We think our solutions differentiate us meaningfully. We get that feedback from the marketplace. In this selling season we continue to see good response to that, but it's not the core driver.","As it relates to deals, you know, listen, I, we're not going to tell you what we're looking at. I can tell you, we're extraordinarily engaged in things. We're going to deploy our cash really carefully though. It's not to say that we will or won't do a deal, it's to say we are going to be really thoughtful about how we invest in ourselves, how we, both through technology, investments and other internal investments, deploy it back to shareholders, and then we do look at M&A. We do like cost containment and payer services sorts of opportunities. We like niche opportunities in areas like worker's compensation and specialty, we are interested in healthcare analytics or medical management. Those are some of the areas that we're looking at out across the broader market as things that will potentially diversify and help our EBIT beyond the core grow. And so we are very, very intentional in those areas. And I think if you were to talk to, you know, pick your fiddler, talk to \u2013 pick your favorite three investment bankers, they would tell you that we're \u2013 we read everything, but we're engaging very, very meaningfully.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And just a clarification, Tim, just the magnitude of the pipeline of opportunities. Would it be realist to assume something could get done this year that would be noteworthy, or is it just impossible to predict and it could be year three before we see anything additive?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","You know, I don't want to predict. I don't think you should expect \u2013 I'm not going to give you any timelines. As much as we're holding ourselves to doing the right deal. And that timing will then ripen however it manifests itself. I would love to see us make sure that we take good care of our cash. And I'll tell you, depending on where things are at right now, buying our stock back is not going to be a bad use until such time as we find something that's also terribly strategically interesting, not just from a cash perspective.","The other thing I'd say, Bob is you know, beyond just deals, I think this core business is built to engage differently with the healthcare supply chain and the \u2013 and the health, and the broadly-defined healthcare services piece. And whether you look at what we've done with blank and Lilly, with Mango, with value-based manufacture agreements, with the diabetes program with Walgreens, with what we did for a major health plan in California as it relates to performance-based retail network, etc. etc. We actually see a pipeline of very interesting opportunities there that don't require us to invest billions of dollars, but actually can leverage innovation and our natural core in very unique ways, and you should expect to hear more about that over the next six months to eighteen months as much as anything else around a more traditional deal flow.","Robert Willoughby - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Eric Percher of Barclays. Your line is open.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you. Could you speak to your methodology with allocation of fixed and corporate expense relative to the three, I guess three segmentations, but really what I'm interested also is how you arrived at, or whether any intention to drive down the total EBITDA associated with Anthem, and what we will be left with at core Express Scripts?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, Eric. So as to our allocation methodology, as we presented in the press release, we're showing adjusted EBITDA from the pieces of the business. So included in there below the margin is a portion of the variable costs. And as it relates to Anthem, if and when it goes, we'd expect those costs to ratably come out as the business goes out. We also allocate a portion of fixed costs. I will tell you that's at a level that's less than their revenue. But on a fixed cost basis, we look department by department, person by person. We've had a very, very refined methodology that we've used over time that looks across the organization, and anything that can be specifically identified to a client is done that way. And then from there, we look at various factors including prescriptions, lives and revenue to allocate remaining costs.","Now to that basis, as Tim talked about in his prepared remarks, we have always been and will continue to be very, very cost-focused. We have three more years before this contract is up, and we have a mind and an eye to cost reduction between now and then. We know what those fixed costs are that have been allocated, and we know what has to be taken out as we approach 2020. So hopefully, that addresses your question.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And history would suggest that these type of contracts tend to roll off over multiple years. How do you think about, or what have you seen, in terms of your ability to reduce costs and how that rolls over the one, two, three years that takes to ramp down?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. So we are \u2013 obviously have been planning for this and are very laser-focused on that. As to that roll-off, what we do know is the contract goes through the end of 2019. So the roll-off couldn't begin until after that date. And then that's entirely up to them. But as we have seen, whether it be through our united contracts, through the Coventry, Catamaran, these things typically take years, not a year. So \u2013 but we can't predict that, but we will be lined up to take the costs out accordingly, with whatever timing the roll-off is.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","And, Tim, you've always stated a commitment to serving the customer. If they \u2013 if Anthem comes to you and says, we want three years as we build it out ourselves. Is there a point at which you turn off the key?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well \u2013 so, I'd start by reminding you that we have a one-year obligation. And after that, quite frankly, it's a negotiable item. And what I would tell you is listen, we're never going to put patients in the middle. We're never going to be in a situation where there's a member who is an Anthem member who can't get what they need. But I can also tell you that, from our perspective, we've got \u2013 we're moving on. That's the message you should get today is, we have a strong core. We've been trying for a year to find a way forward here. We still \u2013 the door is always open here. I'd be much more open for an extension of this contract that we've been trying to get done at market rates in exchange for some up-front money that nobody else can give them.","So, the conversations that we will have as it relates to what happens after 2020 haven't started, and we, quite frankly, will be in a situation where, what we'll have to do is make sure we're taking care of all the rest of our long-term clients, while at the same time not putting their patients in the middle.","Eric Percher - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Thank you for that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Dave MacDonald of SunTrust. Your line is open.","David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Guys, look, I just have one question left. I was wondering, Tim, can you provide just a bit more detail? You talk a little bit about exception pricing, how often this happens, how key you think that is to helping them win. And when you guys have these \u2013 have had these conversations about trying to renew the contract, how often does a topic like that come up?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","It's \u2013 over the years, it's come up a lot. I mean, and it's come up in different ways. As you would recall in the beginning of this contract, you may recall, Anthem underperformed wickedly the script volume that was initially built into the business. It was one of the risks, frankly, that George and the team at the time were taking, was on volume.","And so, from our standpoint, we've worked hard over the years to help them grow by giving them exception pricing on something like 400 individual accounts, mostly on larger national accounts, as you can appreciate, which was not contractually obligated, but we felt it was the right thing to do. We would clearly benefit, and they would clearly benefit from being able to win and grow their national account business.","In addition, when they bought Amerigroup, we constantly updated their pricing on the Medicaid business, and that's why they moved Amerigroup's lives to us early. That was not contractually required, but we thought it was important to do. We've helped them on Medicare Part D, not only operationally, getting them off sanctions, but also actually in continuing to improve their rates there.","And so \u2013 and it's all been just, you know, listen, we are aligned to grow Anthem. We're aligned to grow them, you know, we've been aligned to grow them since 2009. And so, we have been very strategic about working with them to help them win in various marketplaces. And so, as we look forward obviously, you know, the exception pricing process is not contractually required, and it's something that will probably be less critical in the future, but it has been something that we've worked very well with them on, leading up to now.","David S. MacDonald - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Garen Sarafian of Citi Research. Your line is open.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tim and Eric. So first, a follow-up on a prior question regarding the long-term EBITDA growth, 2% to 4%. So you mentioned there's a little bit of a contribution from new client wins, but not much. So, could you just break it down a little bit more? If volume is growing, the data that we're seeing is maybe 1% to 2%, and there's a little bit of new client wins baked into that 2% to 4%. So wondering, just how you guys are thinking about it? If you can give a little bit more clarity. And sort of what the margin is on a per-script basis with no additions? Are you assuming it to be flat? Even down? Up? If you can offer more?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So I'll give you a \u2013 my first crack at it. If we didn't grow volume at all, to us, and if I look at the \u2013 let's take the 2% to 4% range that we gave you, and just dissect that sort of at a macro level.","If we get a headwind on volume, whether that's new wins or utilization, we see that as plus or minus a half a basis point in that overall \u2013 50 basis points, rather \u2013 in that sort of total 2% to 4% equation. You probably have a couple of percent of growth that sits in our product programs, our management of pricing effectively, so that can be a negative, but that's factored in there.","When we look at supply chain management and the opportunities when we look out, and as you can imagine, we aren't just projecting sort of blindly here. We underwrite every day and take risk three years out. And so, we looked at that as we looked at the contribution existing clients over the next three years would have. We look at inflation, both brand and generic inflation, and factor that in.","Again, when you take all of that, the product program, supply chain management, inflation, that has the potential to contribute, I would say, at least 1% to 2% EBITDA growth a year, on average, CAGR.","From a standpoint of then, you've got specialty which, independent from that, we see specialty being a significant growth driver for us. We're having very great success on the pharma side getting access to limited medications. And then obviously, we've won several of the larger independent freestanding specialty bids that were out there over the last year or so. So we're competing well in specialty. And then finally expenses, which again, can be half a point to a point for us in terms of this.","So, when you break it all down, and I'm not going to get more discrete than that, because obviously the world gives us opportunities that we can't even envision sitting here, and our job is to take advantage of them and drive client savings and keep a little bit for ourselves. But that's generally broadly the way to think about it.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. No, fair enough. And then, you mentioned here in this response now, as well as Eric in, I think, the prepared responses, regarding supply chain initiatives in the back-half of the year. So sort of piggybacking on that, last year, you used up your last extension of the contract you have with your current distributor. So maybe last year could have been due to uncertainty with where you were going to be with Anthem.","So, given yesterday and today's news, how does your current assumption of Anthem influence your procurement strategy, both near term for this year, the back half of the year what's going on other than just the renewal and also just longer term?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","It really doesn't change it materially. I mean our job is to make sure that we have a relationship with our distributor that is both from a unit cost standpoint and a strategy standpoint well aligned with our growth of our core in the future. Anthem, quite frankly, again, they're \u2013 they obviously are a significant part of our EBITDA, as we've shown you. As a percentage of our claims that we manage though, and as a percentage of mail specifically, they're actually much lower percentage than they are of the EBITDA.","And so I believe if you were to ask our current distributor, they would say they very much want to retain our business and be a strategic partner to us. And we will end the process this year with a strategic partner that is delivering real value to us. And I can tell you, ABC has done a great job for us, and my preference is to make sure that what we do for the next three years works as well as the last three years, whether that's with ABC or anybody else. And I can tell you that again, that's a process we're going through. And we'll \u2013 probably we or they will have more to report out to you shortly.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from John Kreger of William Blair. Your line is open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Tim, looking beyond Anthem, can you remind us what your rough client mix would be across the book of business? And how do you feel about that? Do you view it as balanced or you think there's work to do there?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","If you take Anthem out, we have a really nicely-balanced book. I would tell you that taking care of our \u2013 particularly \u2013 if you look at health plans, because obviously Anthem's a large health plan \u2013 and they're in multiple lines of business, we're really, really pleased with the relationship we have with major regional players who need what we do at scale. And so our health plan book to business, both the big national or the big blues names that you would recognize as well as other regional players or niche players that play in just one particular line, whether that's Medicaid or Medicare, is a very strong book of business that are trying to compete with the big national players and need a partner like us.","From an employer standpoint, that's sort of a legacy book for us and we're pleased with it. We think some of the dynamics in the United States today lend themselves to tighter labor markets, and therefore employers looking to continue to have terrific employment conditions, including benefits for their folks, but do it affordably. And so we think that, that strong book is good. And then the middle market continues to be \u2013 what defines the middle market anymore for us, and what it would be self-insured in that market continues to grow as the costs have grown. And we have a unique set of solutions for that marketplace as well that again, that book is a strong book that we continue to grow very nicely.","So I really \u2013 if I look across the piece, I think that we have a terrific blended book of business. Obviously, the \u2013 if you look at the DoD and the federal part, we're very proud of not only our footprint with the DoD but a number of other federal clients. And we see opportunities to grow that book fairly significantly over the next two to three years.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. And one last thing. You mentioned value-based pricing a few times. Can you just expand a bit on what your strategy is? How broadly is that being adopted by your clients? And do you see it continuing to be sort of indication-specific, or do you see maybe an opportunity to broaden it out across, perhaps, a full population utilization? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So I'll start, and I'm actually going to \u2013 I've got Dr. Steve Miller here who can expand a little bit more on the \u2013 sort of how what we're thinking about it in the future. What I would say is this: our enrollment in these programs is amazing. Steve stood up at our Outcomes conference just a couple of years ago and basically asked the crowd, is there anybody that's going to stand with us if we approach some manufacturers in oncology for some value-based arrangements in a couple of places?","And hundreds of clients immediately texted their support because they didn't have any partner that was able to do this for them. Their health plans were struggling with this. And we stepped forward. And now when you look at these programs, we have enrollment and inflation protection, for example, of almost 30 million lives. But if you get into the cardiovascular and others, there are over 20 million lives. The newer ones are anywhere from 6 million to 15 million lives. And so \u2013 and we've got several more in the chamber as well. So we see this as a long-term chassis to continue to not only innovate but also to optimize over time.","And so if you look at cardiovascular, which started with the PCSK9 launch, we've now been able to evolve that program as the PCSK9s have expanded their indications to make sure that we provide patient access where it appropriate but also make sure that we do the management of those patients, and then the cost management in the class. But looking forward, we think that is a tremendous chassis. And, Steve, I'll let you provide any additional color to the question.","Steven B. Miller - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Only briefly add a couple comments, and that is this has been incredibly popular. When we introduced it to the marketplace, very few people could do it. To this day, very few companies can actually do it. They talk about doing value-based contracting. We've actually been in the business for several years. As Tim already mentioned, we have over 20 million patients participating every day in our SafeGuardRx programs. Those programs continue to expand.","Glen Stettin in the product area and others continue to add new modules to it. In the coming year, you're going to see additional modules in multiple sclerosis, in respiratory diseases, two huge categories. And so we think the popularity of this will continue to grow. And when you look at our Drug Trend Report, you can actually see the real impact it's having on employers' expenses. So we're very excited about this area.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Charles Rhyee of Cowen & Company. Your line is open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Hey. Thanks for taking the question. Tim, just want to go back to some of your comments around Anthem here. The way you kind of make it sound is that you're still open to dialogue here. Can you give a sense \u2013 but from what you're hearing from Anthem, would you say that this is sort of a closed-and-done decision? Or do you think there's still room for further discussion? And secondly, how often is it that a client doesn't give an incumbent a look at the RFP? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. When you're servicing a client as well \u2013 I'll answer the second part of your question \u2013 when you're servicing a client as well as we're servicing Anthem, it's unheard of to not have the chance to renew the client, quite frankly. Even when they go out and look at the market, which they're \u2013 which they do. So from that standpoint, to me it's very unusual. But this is an unusual contract, so I started my remarks with that.","What I would say is \u2013 I don't want to be glib and say go ask Anthem, because I have to take their statements at face value. I mean, obviously, this decision to disclose not only what we make on Anthem but gives you visibility to the core, was not taken lightly. It was taken in the context of a number of conversations that have occurred over the last 90 days, and the last conversation being one where it was very clear that \u2013 the last conversation where they reached out to us where it was very clear that they said they were moving on. So let me be clear about that. So I have to take that at face value.","Do I hope \u2013 are we going to continue to service their members? Yes. Do I hope that we are \u2013 ultimately that they rethink their \u2013 at least what they told us? Absolutely. I mean we represent the best choice for them. I frankly cannot imagine how their shareholders can withstand not looking at $3 billion worth of value that nobody else can give them. And I just don't understand it, and so we remain absolutely committed to serving them, serving their patients. And my door is always going to be open and my phone will always be in my pocket, hoping that I get that call. But you know what? As of this day, it was our responsibility to provide this visibility.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","That's helpful and thanks. And then you talked about \u2013 you've talked earlier here about the long-term growth, and you talked about 2% to 4% on EBITDA here. When we think down then to EPS, can you give us any sense on where you think sort of the long-term earnings power is here, obviously, with deploying capital, et cetera? Do you think we can maintain sort of a \u2013 at least a double-digit earnings growth trajectory? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. Obviously, we aren't giving you EPS guidance today. But I can \u2013 anyone that knows me or knows our board knows that we're very aligned on setting and achieving high targets. And we \u2013 listen, it's obvious. You can model it out. Over the next three years, we're going to produce a tremendous amount of cash which we will deploy very thoughtfully. And from where I'm sitting, I'll leave it to you to model. But we would be targeting something that is in the double digits.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser of Morgan Stanley. Your line is open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking my question. On the first one, can you help us frame the opportunity to achieve cost savings into context of the Anthem contract? So how should we think about SG&A cost associated with it? What percent of total company SG&A are you allocating? I mean should we assume SG&A's allocated equally across all your customers, or is the SG&A spend towards the Anthem contract is lower because they don't use mail, or they don't use your national formulary as much?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So, Ricky, I'm going to let Eric answer, but I want to actually remind everyone, because I recognize cost allocation is pretty important to us. We've got the DoD as a client, and they have a very detailed requirement around cost accounting that we have implemented a number of years ago. It was right when I joined here that we actually kind of took that to the next level. So I'll let Eric actually answer your question, but I think it's important to note that we have a great team in our finance group here and our legal group that's spent untold hours making sure that we've thoughtfully allocated our cost as best as possible so that what we gave you was a reliable set of numbers that we could then begin quarter-to-quarter to share with you.","But in terms of your specific question, I'll turn it over to Eric to talk about the specific kind of proportionality.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, and so we're not going to get into the exact percentage. As Tim mentioned, and I mentioned before, this is a very sophisticated process we go through. Nothing was changed. It's been reviewed, and again, as Tim mentioned, when you have government clients, anybody that has ever contracted with them, you know what you have to go through in cost allocation. So all of that has been reviewed in the past. I will tell you that their allocation per RX is slightly under our core allocation.","And then as it comes to cost reduction, we have various programs that we have begun to look at our costs over the next three years with a mind of reducing SG&A. We will keep you updated as we progress throughout the year. We're not yet ready to roll-out exactly what our commitments are going to be, but as we progress, it is our intent to do that.","So again, very, very cost-focused. Focused on theirs, and again, with the mind-set when we get out to 2020 and 2021, subject to what happens, we know we have some fixed cost absorption that we have to be prepared to absorb.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. And then, Tim, the health plan business obviously is an important strategic business for you. Recently you highlighted also that Part D is an important growth area for Express. If you do end up losing Anthem, how do you rebuild your managed care presence and your commitment to growing that Part D business?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. Well we start with the fact that, again, as I said, we've got a terrific group of clients beyond Anthem, and we've been focused on helping the m grow in their markets. And they would expect to continue to see us do that, and we will double-down on helping those clients grow in their markets. That's the most important thing.","But secondly, listen, there are a number of large and fairly large health plans that need first-class PBM services. Not going to speculate how things are going to shake out over the next couple of years, but we see a number of opportunities to be a valued partner for national or regional health plans, either as a full-service PBM or again, we have seen great success in being able to sell to the marketplace key aspects of our overall scale to help them then achieve their objectives.","And so I think what you would expect is that over time we're going to be looking at all of those opportunities. I mean, our Blues plans, we've got decades of experience with some of our Blues plans and we have built an entire organization around understanding their brand, enhancing their brand, helping them build their brand. And I think there is more opportunity there as, again, we look at helping them grow in their marketplaces, particularly as health care reform evolves.","I can't imagine the challenge today of running a health plan, and having a partner like us that can at least take the evolving pharmacy component to providing care to the folks that are today in the marketplace, but as that marketplace changes, positions us really, really well. Our technology, our single platform, all those things we think makes us a very attractive partner.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then, just a last clarification on the retention rates. I think you talked about 95% to 98%. So if you can just remind us of the methodology? Is it retention rates as a percent of revenue? If so, does that also include Anthem, or is it a percent of scripts?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","It's a percent of scripts. And it's a \u2013 we've had the same methodology for years. Yes, it is a percent of scripts.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And it includes Anthem in it?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","That's correct.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Jones of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks for the question. I guess, just to get kind of back to thinking about the core business, Tim, in a world beyond Anthem. It looks like core profitability ex-Anthem still screens a bit higher than your closest peers. So I guess, as we try to think about the absorption of these fixed costs that won't be able to be eliminated, if and when Anthem does roll off, could you maybe just give us some context around \u2013 looks like the core business, ex-Anthem, what you're providing today, looks like it's around $4.10 EBITDA per claim. Is there anything directionally you can help us think through as far as what that number would look like once you're fully exited from Anthem?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, I mean, we've shown you what the core is without Anthem. And what I would say about our \u2013 let me say this about our core EBITDA per script. First of all, we have a long history that predates me as a CEO here of managing costs extraordinarily well. And so, one component of being better than the other guys at EBITDA per script is managing costs really, really well. I said that, when we had a competitor that no longer exists, that was out there talking about how they could do it for \u2013 they were making $2 a script to our, at the time, I think $3.50. And the answer then, which proved out to be correct was, they're making $2 a script not because they're selling themselves cheaper, but because their cost structure is more. And that we could beat their price points and actually have better EBITDA because of our efficiency. That continues, and that will continue to be a hallmark of our company.","But I think the other thing that's important \u2013 and you saw it in the 2015 to 2016 jump in profitability of the core \u2013 is that in 2016, we had a great number of levers in our hands that we told you, in 2017, some of those are not in our hands. But when we look forward the next three to four years, they come back into our hands. Retail, big negotiations. We had a Walgreens negotiations last year. Our SafeGuardRx programs, last year was a banner year for launching those.","We don't have quite as many we're launching this year, and we pulled a lot of enrollment into last year by virtue of client interest. And so what you saw in 2016 was that the EBIT grew over 6% in the core. To me \u2013 and by the way, clients' drug spends \u2013 or drug trends, surprisingly to some, but not to us, dropped 27%. And we saved our clients billions and added a couple hundred million to incremental EBITDA, particularly if you factor out cost savings that also contributed to our EBIT growth in 2016.","So, when I look at that, that says, wow, your core model performs particularly well when you align with clients, you drive down their costs, you launch the kind of programs that get the kind of enrollments we saw. And when we look forward, we see tremendous opportunities to do that. And so I fully expect that you will see moderate growth in EBITDA per script in the core as a result of us continuing to innovate, do the things Steve and Glen are doing, and that clients need.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That's fair. And then I guess, just, Tim, I know you're not giving EPS guidance, but obviously having the goal of double-digit. Just to be clear, that would be reflective of the company in its entirety over the next three years, including any residual profit you'll be getting from Anthem. Is that right?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I would say that's right.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from Brian Tanquilut of Jefferies. Your line is open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey, Tim. Just to follow up on that last question from Bob on pricing and EBITDA per script. So how do you address investor concerns about what's seemingly becoming a more competitive environment, with Prime and Optum emerging as more aggressive players? And tying that with EBITDA per script visibility that you just provided to the Street and to your clients today. So, if I'm a client sitting on the sidelines seeing this EBITDA per script, how do you calm those clients down and say that we're not over-earning on your book? And how do you address investor concerns about that?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So, first of all, even the core EBITDA per script we showed you, I need to point out, includes some significant services business that our \u2013 through our DFO (58:07) formulary business, similar to what we have with Catamaran. And so again, some of that backs out.","But I can tell you, clients, by and large \u2013 I don't think I've ever had a consultant say to me, your EBITDA per script is too high compared to somebody else's. They look at their clients' pricing compared to the marketplace. They look at their clients' pricing and outcomes based on commitments we make, risks we take, programs we enroll them in, drug trend results. That's the stuff, quite frankly, that either causes you to win or lose a client.","Now that being said, from my perspective, we always have to continue to drive at our cost structure and so forth. And I think there was a study that came out from Dezante (58:44) just a couple months ago that showed a six to one return on PBM services to payers, if you looked at what they were paying all in. I can tell you that our clients are seeing that or better, and our job is going to be to continue to demonstrate our value. And as long as we demonstrate our value, I'm not concerned about what our EBITDA per script is.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","No, I appreciate that. And just a follow-up for Eric. So if you're committing 30% of operating cash to debt pay-down over the next three years, I mean the math just basically says we should expect a lower level of buybacks over that same period, right?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, based on that, it takes on average of about that 30% to get us down to around a two times leverage in 2020. So, that's the math. It may be a little more or less in any one year, but on average, that's what it will take. And the remainder, as I said in my prepared notes, subject to internal investment and M&A, the rest will be committed to share buybacks.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Eric, any levers you can pull to push the cash flow generation up a little bit near-term?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Materially, probably not. We continue to work, from a working capital perspective, to maximize the working capital aspect. But absent that, it's growth in the business, growth in EBITDA, that will be the main driver.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got it. Appreciate it. Thanks, guys.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Operator, we'll take one more call, but I know we're at the bottom of the hour.","Operator","Okay. Thank you. The next question comes from Anthony Vendetti of Maxim Group. Your line is open.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Thanks. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the beginning of a contract with a new client. And if you want to talk about Anthem, that'd be helpful. But obviously in the beginning, there's a lot of up-front costs, which you alluded to in your written comments on the release last night.","So I know that $2.2 billion is the adjusted EBITDA number for Anthem in 2016. But can you talk about the first couple of years? Was it negative in the first year? Or what was that number? And then, in the second year? And when did it officially become profitable for you?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, so it underperformed right out of the chute in terms of the volume they delivered. I can tell you I wasn't here at that time, so I can't speak to the \u2013 some of the conversations that would have been had with them, but I know it underperformed. They began in effect for the first probably until after the Medco acquisition, this thing underperformed the financial assumptions that the board and the leadership team of this company committed to in order to write the $4.7 billion check, which turned out to be a very good investment for them and their stock.","Our investment looked a little more risky in those early years because of the poor volume and the poor growth. What I would tell you is, after getting the Medco deal done, it allowed us to rationalize our infrastructure aggressively, which we did. It also allowed us to go back out to the supply chain, and even in the non-tightly managed business gain additional leverage. And the way that their contract was written, we were able to gain share as rebates increased and so forth in a way that finally began to turn this thing around just in the last couple of years.","And so from that standpoint, again, and this is very different. Let me just, again, reemphasize. I can't \u2013 there's no other contract we have that's remotely similar as it relates to those dynamics, because we typically, you know, from that standpoint, don't give up front money at all. We don't buy a functioning, or in this case a sanctioned pharmacy to operate it. We typically come in and provide services. So this was very, very different.","And so, again, the management team at the time at Anthem, again, I can't speak for them, but I believe they didn't see the generic discounts increasing as aggressively as they have in the market because of us and others doing our job. I believe they didn't see brand inflation being as high as it was in the outer years. And so I believe that, you know, there's certainly some sound bites that they thought they took some pretty good risk on this deal and they were going to be winners.","You know what? I think they were winners. We got them back in business. We gave them a great pharmacy product. We're aligned like heck with them. We've taken great care of their members. We've done that without them enrolling in some of our most tightly-managed programs, some of those they are now more recently enrolling in, such as tightly-managed formularies. And in the end now, we've got a snapshot, but when you see the movie, you see that this thing, you know, required a lot of work on our part to get to the point where it is today. And obviously, I'd love nothing more than to have them call me back and give us the chance to service their patients over the long-term, but that's not my decision to make.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","It seems like certainly that would at least make sense for them to consider. Okay. Thank you very much.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I want to thank everybody for your interest and for your support today. Obviously it's been a long year and a bit. We've talked a lot about trying to improve our disclosure to you. Hopefully what you see today and moving forward is a real commitment to our shareholders to growing our core and to making you look really smart by being investors in our company. So thank you.","Operator","Thank you. That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"8764":["Express Scripts Holding Co.

Sir, you may begin.","Benjamin Bier - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you. Good morning. With me today are Tim Wentworth, Chief Executive Officer and President; and Eric Slusser, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties.","The company's actual results may differ materially from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail on the company's most recent Form 10-K and form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update or otherwise release publicly, any revisions to our forward-looking statements.","For clarity purposes, all financial numbers, except where indicated, that we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis and are attributable to Express Scripts excluding non-controlling interest representing the share allocated to members of our consolidated affiliates. Furthermore, we are providing underlying performance of the company's core PBM business excluding the contributions from Coventry and Catamaran, both of which were acquired and are rolling up the company's book of business to which we refer together as the transitioning clients as well as Anthem.","This presentation will be posted on our website and includes an appendix with footnotes and the reconciliations of non-GAAP measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.express-scripts.com.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to Tim.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thanks, Ben, and good morning, everyone. Before Eric discusses our financial results, I want to briefly reinforce our strong position in a dynamic environment and share examples of how our focused independent model is delivering innovative, sustainable outcomes for clients and patients.","Every day, we see another unexpected headline or an added degree of uncertainty to the health care policy environment. However, regardless of politics or policy agenda, one thing is clear: the need to effectively manage health care spend is front and center for payers who want to provide affordable benefits.","As labor markets tighten and insurers compete for members who are increasingly focused on the value they receive for every dollar spent, our role has become even more significant. In this context, even in a year when drug price inflation has somewhat moderated, payers need help navigating the pipeline of innovative treatments being brought to market as well as the already high price tag of many existing drugs.","Express Scripts is uniquely positioned as a clinically focused, scaled partner for our 3,000 clients and their members. Our dedication to innovation in pharmacy creates better value for payers and greater access for patients. Increasingly we are demonstrating that we can drive value-based outcomes in pharmacy, aligning payers, patients, and those pharma companies who want to provide greater value.","As we look out over the next three to five years, we see a number of key value levers emerging including further evolved value-based contracting strategies, comprehensive management of specialty pharmacy, the emergence of biosimilars, innovative plan designs, and the use of large scale data sets to drive better behavior and outcomes. These strategies powered by our unique assets including our therapeutic resource centers, our home delivery pharmacy, our Accredo specialty pharmacy and our supply chain management expertise will continue to drive our innovation and create patient access.","Nearer term, in this quarter we showed the breadth and flexibility of our model. In this quarter alone, we entered into a novel group purchasing organization agreement with Walgreens Boots Alliance Development where we can procure generic drugs at a lower cost and continue to do so well into the future.","We launched Inside Rx, a program that will more directly deliver savings to cash paying patients at the point of sale. While providing discounts at the point of sale is not new, with Inside Rx, we convened retail, pharma and a technology partner to provide significantly lower costs for cash paying patients.","We collaborated with several key health plan clients to launch SmartShare Rx, which enables patient and drug-specific rebates to be offered to our PBM members at the point of sale. For payers, our SmartShare Rx solution gives them enhanced flexibility to offer plan designs that match their growth and patient engagement strategies.","We introduced a novel opioid solution which leverages a number of our unique capabilities to help patients who are newly prescribed opioids. In our pilot study, which we conducted with a bunch of our clients, we reduced hospitalizations by 38%, we reduced ER visits by 40% and we decreased average supply of opioids by 20%. Our approach helps ensure patients get the medicine they need while curbing overprescribing and overuse, and it helps our clients with this national problem.","Also, in this quarter, we acquired myMatrixx, an innovative leader in workers compensation which expands our leadership in this important area of pharmacy management. Finally, we will be launching a CVS-anchored retail network option for our diabetes care value program, offering yet another flexible choice to our clients as we manage this critical area of spend. These are just a few examples of how our independent model uniquely enables us to work across the supply chain and beyond in full alignment with our clients' best interests.","Another key driver of value for us and our clients is our national preferred formulary. Approximately 25 million members are covered by this formulary, and it is the largest managed formulary in the United States. You are familiar with the generic wave that drove significant savings and value in the 2000s and still does today. But given the proliferation of new branded products entering the market over the last few years, today we are in the midst of what I would call the formulary wave fueled by multiple competing branded products in virtually every therapy class.","Our national preferred formulary is just one example of how active management of the pharmacy benefit continues to create extraordinary value for our clients while ensuring patients get what they need. Next week, we will release our 2018 national preferred formulary list where we expect to provide $2.5 billion in value to our clients. What's even more important is that we will do this while ensuring greater than 99% of patients will experience no change. We deliver maximum savings with minimum disruption, exactly what our clients want.","In the five years ending with 2018, I'm proud to say we have delivered more than $7.4 billion in cumulative savings to clients through our national preferred formulary. As we have stated, this formulary is predominantly used by commercial clients today with most health plans managing this area themselves.","However, this year an increasing number of our health plan clients are relying on our scale and our negotiating expertise and are leveraging us to manage formulary, deliver greater value and help them compete. We've earned their trust and will continue to do so by delivering real value supported by our strong clinical and patient-focused model and our innovative approach to value-based contracting.","Of course, brand formulary management is only one of several levers that we use to drive low net costs. Looking at a couple of significant spend categories a bit deeper, we expect the net cost per prescription from 2016 to 2018 to decrease by 20% per year on average in diabetes and by 16% annually in respiratory.","This is not only driven by formulary exclusions but is powered by new generics, specialized care, utilization management protocols, channel management, and value-based contracts. Our innovative approach comprehensively manages complex expensive classes of medications that is delivering value beyond to our clients and their patients.","From a renewal perspective, we are not satisfied where we sit today overall. There have been several cases in our book, specifically in the state government segment, that have moved this year. As a result, we are revising our full year retention rate guidance to a midpoint of 95% with a range of 94% to 96%.","That said, we are pleased with our results in several key market segments. Importantly, our performance in our health plan and Federal business renewals has been very strong with virtually 100% retention. Additionally, our commercial business has also had an exceptional year with renewals. We have also seen strong enrollment across our book in our value-based solutions, including SafeGuardRx and our 90-day programs.","From a new sales standpoint, we are encouraged by our results in what is a lighter selling season than average. As you may recall, a number of meaningful opportunities we expected to compete for have been pushed out. In fact, while this year is light, there are nearly 1.5 billion adjusted prescriptions expected to be in play for January 1, 2019 and January 1, 2020 combined. We are actively engaged with this longer-term pipeline and are optimistic about the early indications we are receiving.","In fact, we had 50 prospects attend our recent outcome symposium. They collectively represented 300 million adjusted prescriptions. Our solution resonated well and positions us for an ongoing differentiated dialogue with these prospects.","Every member of my team and I are laser-focused on taking great care of our existing clients and their patients while ensuring that our innovative results-driven solutions differentiate us in a marketplace where we are well positioned to grow.","I will now turn it over to Eric to provide insight into our financial performance.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thank you, Tim, and good morning, everyone. We are pleased to report second quarter-adjusted earnings per share of $1.73, which represents an increase of 10% over last year and above the midpoint of our guidance range. Our adjusted claims for the quarter were $350 million, also above the midpoint of our guidance range. We also saw adjusted SG&A decrease 5% over last year as our leadership team continues to be focused on cost management.","We generated $1.8 billion of EBITDA. Consistent with previous years, this quarter includes approximately $53 million of incremental revenue and operating income related to the structure of our Anthem contract. Excluding the impact from the Anthem contractual payment, EBITDA for adjusted claim is $5.06, up 5% over last year.","Our core PBM EBITDA grew 6% in the quarter and 3.5% year-to-date. This increase is due to the acceleration of supply chain initiatives, including our successful generic procurement process as well as cost management. While we expect core PBM EBITDA growth to continue in the second half of the year, it will moderate slightly due to the certain cost benefits that occurred in 2016 that are not expected to repeat in the second half of 2017.","From a cash flow perspective, we generated $1.1 billion of net cash flow from operations, up 146% over last year. We also repurchased 18.5 million shares for approximately $1.2 billion during the quarter. Share repurchases were made through a combination of both open market purchases and a 10b5-1 plan. We are very pleased with our financial performance year to date, which leads us to our 2017 updated guidance.","We continue to expect 2017 adjusted claims to come in at a midpoint of 1.4 billion, generating expected EBITDA of $7.4 billion at the midpoint of our range, 2% over 2016 adjusted EBITDA. We are raising our adjusted earnings per diluted share for the year from a range of $6.90 to $7.04 to a new range of $6.95 to $7.05. This represents growth of 9% to 10% at the midpoint of the range. Our increased guidance is primarily attributed to the management of our capital structure.","We now expect diluted weighted average shares outstanding to be in the range of 580 million to 590 million. In the second half of 2017, our diluted share range balances additional share repurchases with debt payment, along with potentially making strategic acquisitions and leaving some cash on the balance sheet to pay off maturities coming due in the first quarter of 2018. This approach allows us to maintain our leverage targets from now through 2020.","With respect to the third quarter of 2017, we expect adjusted EPS to be in the range of $1.88 to $1.92, up 8% to 10% year-over-year.","Finally, I want to spend a couple of minutes talking about our new multiyear enterprise value initiative. We are launching an enterprise value initiative to make us more efficient and a better partner to those we serve. As we look ahead, this effort should position us to better compete in the future and offset some of the impact from Anthem in 2020 and beyond.","We expect to invest $600 million to $650 million, which should generate savings in the range of $550 million to $600 million annually. Savings will be driven by our investments to eliminate unnecessary work, automate processes, improve quality, lower our cost to fill for prescriptions at both Home Delivery and Accredo, rationalize our footprint, and improve our administrative operations.","We have four main objectives under our enterprise value initiative. First, we will be improving patient engagement by increasing investment in our digital assets. We are advancing solutions that make it easier for patients to make the best choices.","As we evolve our mobile app, more patients will use it, which creates a better experience and makes it easier to work with us. Higher levels of self-service, improved net promoter scores, and reductions in rework and phone calls position us to more efficiently deliver the service our patients expect. We have already reduced the number of calls per home delivery prescription by over 25% in the last year and expect to further reduce that figure in the coming years.","Second, we will be improving position engagement through better data integration and technology enablement. We will better integrate electronic medical records and electronic health records to provide important clinical data to physicians at the point of care and facilitate a significant improvement in the number of automated prior authorizations we process each year.","Our goal is to double the number of electronic prior authorizations and also to significantly increase the rate of electronic prescribing. These investments will increase patient and physician satisfaction, reduce manual intervention, and deliver better care.","Third, we will be creating a better client experience. We will speed implementation of complex plan designs, improve data reporting, and enhance the onboarding experience for new members. By improving our automated setup process, we will decrease manual processes, more rapidly implement benefit design changes, and deliver greater value.","Finally, we will be improving our cost efficiency. By driving down our cost structure, eliminating work, automating processes, and optimizing our business, we will deliver better care to patients and greater savings to clients. We are building a company that will be more nimble and agile. Our new investments will improve our productivity, generating more value for those we serve. We are still refining our detailed plans for all of our enterprise value initiatives and expect to provide updates on future earnings calls.","So we've covered a lot of ground today. To sum it up, we delivered $1.73 in adjusted earnings per diluted share, an increase of 10% over Q2 of 2016. We continue to see strong response to our differentiated product offerings and business model, and finally, we are executing on a path to growth by strategically investing in our future to evolve our organization.","At this point, we'll be happy to take questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question is coming from the line of Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Ma'am, your line is open. Lisa, your line is now open. Kindly check if you're in mute. Once again, Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is now open, ma'am.","Benjamin Bier - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Operator, we can go to the next call and come back to Lisa. She may have just stepped away. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Rob Jones, Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks for the questions. Tim, just wanted to start with the retention and the change in expectations for the year. If I look at the marketplace, the expected Anthem departure, the fact that it seems like you lost a few of the state level contracts this selling season, do you feel there's a need to rethink the approach to retaining clients and maybe bidding on new clients? Just from the outside looking in, it does seem like others might be being more competitive, aggressive in the marketplace right now.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Thanks for the question, Bob. And what I'd say is, first of all, we always \u2013 we evaluate every time we win or lose and try to understand and learn from it, and this year is certainly a year where we're doing that. I would tell you that as I said in my prepared remarks, when I look at the bids this year that we've been successful in \u2013 let's talk about renewal first. It's across virtually every market segment except the state bids, and the state bids this year, we'd be in the range we originally gave you if not for two recent announcements that were very disappointing to us.","When we look at those, those are bids that you don't have a lot of incumbency in value. You're bidding on those without the opportunity to have back and forth with your client, and so you're having to decide to go in blind a little bit. And what I will tell you is we are looking very hard at what should we have done differently in those cases. There's one case that we are actually not satisfied with the process, and we've made it clear to the state in that case. But you know what? We've got to compete and win in those processes, and we're looking very hard at that.","But our other renewals, we're very pleased with sort of the way it's played out. The market is very competitive, as you know. We had some very large cases that we've been very pleased to keep across the book. And again, our overall retention outside of the states is as strong as it's been, if not stronger.","So we aren't going to overcorrect here, but we're always evaluating what we need to do to go forward. That's why what Eric announced this morning as it relates to our enterprise value initiative is so critical as a piece of the puzzle. We recognize we have competitors that are streamlining, getting more aggressive and smarter about how they run their business. We've got to do the same thing with ours. And I can tell you, that's a longstanding sort of way that we go about things here that we're doubling down on as we look forward.","In terms of new business, just to touch that for a second, we had a good new business year with the exception of corner cases, but most of the corner cases we were looking to compete for didn't actually come out this year. And so we do see sort of the next two years as years where we've got to come in strong, be competitive, bring value, but not do that in a way that's not responsible.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And just talking about some of the investments you and Eric touched on in the prepared remarks, it sounds like you're investing in the user experience and trying to improve the Home Delivery process. And it does seem like that will be a home-grown initiative. Any thoughts on partnering there, Tim, to accelerate the improvement in the client experience? And specifically, I'm thinking about Home Delivery.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","What I would say is everything is on the table for us. As you saw last quarter, we did a lot of really interesting partnering across the piece to attack a number of different opportunities. And when we look at Home Delivery, I'm not going to name any one sort of approach that we may or may not take to it. I can tell you this, that as we look at it, it's a great asset. It sits inside of a number of the SafeGuardRx programs and continues to.","When I look at something like our recently announced GoodRx collaboration with Inside Rx to go after cash-paying patients, for example, there may be some opportunities there. When I look at what we do in digital, we actually collaborate already with certain folks outside our company to, again, build that out in a longer term way. So the answer is everything is on the table as we build our plans and look at how to optimize every part of our business to deliver for patients and payers long term.","Robert Patrick Jones - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Great. Thanks. Appreciate it.","Operator","Thank you. Next is from Lisa Gill from J.P. Morgan. Ma'am, your line now is open. Okay. Moving forward to our next question, from Garen Sarafian, Citigroup. Your line is now open.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, Tim and Eric. First just to touch on retention again. Tim, I understand the reasons why you updated the retention number, but looking forward for the rest of the year, what does the 94% bake in? So how confident are you that that is the lower end of the range? How conservative is it? I guess, what's still up to renew to give us the level of confidence?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. Thanks for the question. I won't name names. What I'll say is we've got a couple of good sized cases that are out that we feel good about, quite frankly, but we decided in abundance of caution, to give you the range that would envision sort of what I would call pretty near to a worst-case scenario. I hope next quarter \u2013 well, I intend next quarter to sit back down with you and probably tighten that range up, and my goal is that we nail down this last one or two and be well positioned.","I will tell you this, again, we have a lot of discussion as you might imagine about the range. Because the 95% that we have at the midpoint was in our old range, but we just concluded that given that we had a couple of disappointing recent losses, we would be more responsible to show you what the low end could look like. Again, we're not targeting that as you could imagine.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then just changing gears a little bit, on the WBAD partnership, guidance doesn't seem to contemplate any contribution for this year. I broadly understand how aligning the contracts take time, but could you elaborate a little bit more on why there's not more of a contribution from May's announcement for this year?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. I'll start and then if Everett Neville, who heads up Supply Chain especially for me has anything to add, I'll ask him to jump in. What I'll say is this, we just sent people to Switzerland about a week ago. We're getting this off the ground. And I would also remind you that we waited until we had completed our own generic bid before then sort of doing the final arrangement with WBAD because we felt it was important to be sure that what we came to the table with was our best work that we could then judge how much value we could create incrementally off of what we already were able to achieve ourselves. And I believe they probably did the same thing.","And so when you look at that, you realize there may be some small amount of opportunity that we can create this year by going back out and working some of the contracts, but the majority of the work, both of setting it up, and then of sort of harvesting the future opportunity with the value that our combined volume creates is really an 2018 phenomenon.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I completely agree with that and echo that. The other factor given that we just completed our generic process, the clean room process that we had run is probably not accurate, and therefore, we haven't used it to forecast. And we're in the process of redoing that. There may be some fourth quarter value, but we're targeting 2018 for most of that value.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","But it sounds like it's more of a \u2013 it's process related, not necessarily contractual obligations that prevent you from achieving savings sooner.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","That's correct.","Garen Sarafian - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from John Kreger, William Blair. Your line is now open.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Hi. Thanks very much. Tim, if you can think about the lower and upper end of your range for retention for next year, what would that translate into, kind of total claims based upon what you know now in 2018? Flat or down a little bit? If you could just elaborate on that, that would be helpful.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. Obviously, I know you won't expect me to give you 2018 guidance. I would tell you that if we came in at the low end of the range or frankly coming in the middle of the range, I would expect given the selling season, it's early because we've got plans that are out themselves winning and we won't have some of the line of sight to our health plan success in the market. We've been helping them win quite a bit, yet. But I would tell you that it would be likely that we would be flat to down somewhat, slightly I guess would be how you'd characterize it.","That being said, we don't talk about EBIT retention versus claims retention. That does not translate into a dampening of our view that our 2% to 4% long term guidance and our 2018 push is going to be dramatically changed by that because, again, these accounts that we did not keep, the state accounts, they tend to be priced very deeply. They tend to, particularly in the first year, not significantly contribute to EBITDA.","You obviously like them for the long term and you hope you can obviously move them to a pathway of profitability, but while you see claims down somewhat, you're not going to see us talk about as a reason that we would be coming in with guidance that would be otherwise disappointing.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you. And it looked like your wording around Anthem was pretty much the same as it was on the first quarter release, but any change that you can update us on here?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. So what I would say is probably nothing that's material. But we've had some back and forth correspondence, I'd talked about that last quarter, between myself and Anthem's CEO. Last week, we did receive the pricing portion of their RFP in-house. We're working through the details of that and plan to respond accordingly. It's a fairly short time line.","We believe we're the best option for them still, but I want to be really clear that \u2013 not to get too excited about the fact that we've received any portion of that RFP. It has not changed our assessment of our odds at this point at all in terms of renewing them. Certainly, not since last quarter have we reassessed those as being any better. But we are certainly happy to give them something to consider, and we're taking it seriously. But that's probably as much as I've got. Beyond that, the litigation process continues, and we expect discovery to go through the end of 2017.","John C. Kreger - William Blair & Co. LLC","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And next question is from Charles Rhyee, Cowen & Company. Your line is now open.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Yes. Thanks. Hey. Tim, you mentioned earlier in your comments around the National Formulary in terms of \u2013 you talked about that $2.5 billion in savings when the new formulary comes out. I guess, two questions. First, what is the change in terms of clients adopting the National Formulary that you've seen so far for next year? Maybe you can give us a reference on what percentage of clients have been adopting this. You did talk about the health plans. Maybe can you talk about what percentage of your health plan customers have been adopting the National Formulary? Just trying to get a sense on what the opportunity there is in that regard. Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. Thanks. And again, I'll let Everett jump in here. What I'd say is this. For us, we've got virtually our entire commercial book that's enrolled in the National Preferred Formulary, the large mid-sized employers. And it's performed well, and the stickiness is virtually 100%. We don't have clients back out of the formulary from year to year.","And as I said in my prepared remarks, when you're delivering \u2013 last year, we delivered less than 3% or less than 2.5% disruption. This year, what we're going to be showing clients next week is on average 1% or less. The clients have seen that we're able to make the changes without disrupting members, and the members that would be affected we've been able to manage very effectively with our therapeutic resource centers. So we've had 100% virtual stickiness in that.","We definitely have had clients come into it as well as on the commercial book, and in the cases we're winning, because we're winning quite a bit in the middle market now, that's the standard bid that we bring, and those employers almost all come in for the National Preferred Formulary.","As it relates to health plans, it's the early innings. We've had a couple of them actually adopt for certain lines of business. I think it's important to understand that our health plan clients have multiple lines of business, but in their commercial space in particular, and particularly those that have large national account commercial populations, those are the ones we've been working with to either in the case of a couple Blues plans implement the formulary verbatim or work with them in key therapeutic chapters where they're able to leverage our negotiating scale and prowess to incrementally create value for themselves.","And so what I'd say is we've had I think four health plans that we are now managing their formulary for them where they were before managing that. And obviously, we've got another dozen and a half large ones that we would hope to ultimately be able to deepen the relationship that we already have with them. I don't know if you want to add any color to that.","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","There's not a lot to add. The only other factor would be that those clients that cannot adopt our National Preferred because of their benefit design, maybe a union contract, many of them are taking components of the National Preferred. So they're taking PAs or they're doing something in a therapeutic class that mimics what we're doing in the National Preferred in order to get that value.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","I would just echo that by way of example. I can think of a very large health plan that we have that does their own formulary, but when hepatitis C became an active category for management, they cut their own deal and then ultimately wound up coming back and leveraging ours instead and producing value for them and for us as they engaged with us to do that. That's one example.","So the thing I would point out, because we're making it sound a little bit more sort of in series than it really is, is we have with all of our health plans ongoing conversations about formulary and look to where we can augment their strategy or in fact as we have again for several large ones this year, step in and actually manage it for them.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Great. Let me just follow up. Obviously, you had a nice step up in the core growth of the business in terms of EBITDA. Can you give us a sense on particularly in the back half of the year for the rest of the year guidance and particularly since you gave third quarter guidance, what should we kind of assume for core growth perhaps? Thanks.","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, this is Eric. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we're very pleased with the second quarter at 6%. The second half of the year, given the significant cost reductions we had in 2016, the year-over-year comps because of those cost reductions, will cause that to moderate some.","But the things that will drive that, the high side to low side, certainly, to the extent volume is up in both mail and Accredo, we also have a couple of generic launches that are teetering between 2017 and 2018 and depending on whether they come in early, obviously, we've rolled out a lot of new programs, as Tim talked about. To the extent the adoption of those continues like it has been, there's upside opportunity. Our enterprise value initiative to the extent we can generate savings early in that process provide upside.","And then as Tim and Everett talked about, the possibility that there may be potentially a fourth quarter upside from the WBAD contract. So those are kind of some of the tailwinds that could drive it to the higher. The headwinds, fortunately not a lot. Certainly, any slowdown in utilization would be a headwind. And then finally us not hitting our cost targets. But we are good at that. We are very focused on that. And so, again, we feel good about the second half, which is reflected in both our guidance and our increase in guidance for the year.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Co. LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. And our next one, Steve Valiquette, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. Good morning, Tim and Eric. Thanks for taking the question. So I think at this point it's quite early to have a thorough discussion around Amazon as a player in the pharmaceutical supply channel. But just to the extent that they may have some desire to try to dispense drugs on a large scale through Home Delivery, they would obviously need access to networks and reimbursements.","I guess to that end, just curious if it's the natural instinct of Express Scripts to perhaps not want to allow other home delivery providers into its pharmacy networks to avoid losing market share? Or would Express be willing to reimburse a company like Amazon for dispensing Home Delivery drugs? Just curious to get your initial thoughts round this.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","It's a great question. What I would point to sort of as an evidence point of our thinking is how we've evolved our thinking around 90-day programs that are omni-channel. And so as I think about Amazon and what they may choose to do in pharmacy, you said it right in the beginning, which is, you know, becoming a PBM is a lot more than dispensing drugs. In fact, becoming a PBM requires you to figure out how not to dispense drugs or to dispense the right drugs as much as it does to dispense them.","So it's a long pull to become a PBM. But if Amazon were looking to be an efficient provider in networks, we would welcome that opportunity. We would certainly make sure that there were lots of boxes checked that would enable our members to have access to good quality care. But from our perspective, we can still wrap our TRC's around, as we do our retail partners, we can wrap our TRC's around those patients, our therapy resource centers. We think Amazon is a great client for us. We think they are obviously a company that if they choose to move in a direction, we'd be interested in working with them.","Steven J. Valiquette - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. That's helpful color. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from Erin Wright, Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. On capital deployment, can you speak to some of the opportunities in adding assets in integrity, fraud and abuse capabilities and what that could add to your platform? And how do you weigh these opportunities relative to workers comp, which you recently did a deal in and specialty as well? And then just broadly, do you view there is more of a sense of urgency now to be active on the M&A front relative to maybe even what you were thinking three months ago? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. Thanks. Let me answer the last half first, which is three months ago, I made pretty clear that we were engaged in ongoing conversations, as you would expect a company of our size with our cash to be and our position in a very dynamic market, on M&A. And that has not changed. So we had amped up this year our engagement, and we continue to be highly engaged in a pipeline of opportunities.","To your question as it relates to specifically using data, safety, fraud, waste and abuse, it is certainly an area that is good for our clients. It's good for us. We can build as well as potentially look to integrate other solutions that may be in the marketplace.","If you look at what we did this quarter in opioids, both for our clients with the large launch that we did as well as for the state of Missouri what we'll be doing more locally, it leverages a lot of our existing capabilities, our existing data, our ability to integrate with patients through specialist pharmacies, to create significant outcomes that are being bought by our clients now. The clients' reaction to our opioid solution has been very, very strong and that's a service they're paying for.","So we do think there is build and potentially buy opportunities in the space broadly defined as payer services, utilization controls and management, integrity, fraud, waste, and abuse and those sorts of things. But we do like being able to invest in ourselves, too. We have a lot of the core assets and relationships that enable us to do a great deal.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. And can you speak to the CVS diabetes care program you alluded to? How has this feedback been in the early stages of the diabetes program? How are you expecting enrolled lives to trend over the next year? Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. Thanks. So obviously we are really pleased with the ability to work across multiple players in the space including both Walgreen's and CVS as two anchor stores, and we have clients who naturally would profile to choose one or the other of those anchors based on their population and so forth.","And so for us, it was a natural extension to take the program that we had with the tools that we bring to it, but also with what we were going to be able to get retail to support as it relates to both rates and care, and be able to offer, as it were, an anchor either way which would then broaden the number of clients who would look at a program from a disruption standpoint and be able to make it easier to sell through to those patients, those clients on the edge.","We've had very good sell-in of our initial launch of our diabetes care value program. We believe that this newly anchored program, which really is a clone, will then broaden a bit further the number of patients and clients that we're able to serve with that.","I don't know, Everett, if there is anything you want to add.","Everett Neville - Express Scripts Holding Co.","The only thing I would add is the diabetes SafeGuardRx was the first SafeGuardRx program that we have that had a retail component. And so we were able to work that through with Walgreens. They were open to taking some risk, quite frankly, in working with us, and as such we were able to sell that almost for a year now \u2013 about ten months.","We recently have reached agreement with CVS to do the same thing. We have about a little over 7 million lives in the diabetes care to date. I would expect less than that in the CVS, but we'll begin selling that. We haven't officially begun selling that. We'll begin selling that here in the next couple of months.","Erin Wilson Wright - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Excellent. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next one, Lisa Gill from JPMorgan. Your line is now open.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I hope that the third time is the charm.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. We can hear you. We got you.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","I Okay. Great. So first, let me start with \u2013 if I go back to last quarter, you talked about core growth in your core PBM of 2% to 4% growth. And Tim and Eric, if I recall correctly, you talked about getting towards the upper end of that range, that you needed the retention rate to be towards the upper end of your 95% to 98%. As we think about now, 2018 and even going forward, how important is retention versus plan design? So Tim, it sounds to me like what you're talking about today is a lot of different programs are resonating with existing clients and that you have lost some state government business that may not adopt all of these programs. So I just want to try to frame how to think about how important retention is versus how important plan design is as we move forward?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. Thanks for the question. What I'd say is what we said last quarter, specifically, was that volume or utilization, which would include retention, was in the 2% to 4% number for us. Roughly 50 basis points of sort of movement one way or the other. And I would not give you a different number today.","That being said \u2013 and so that would lead you to believe that plan design is more important. And there is no question that innovating and driving down our clients' trends and selling programs into our clients that produce value for them and value for us, is the key element of the business model.","That said, from our perspective, 95% or better retention has always been sort of in my time in the business, kind of what you had to target. You recognize that there was some natural churn in the middle-market, you recognize that there were a few cases that would move any given year that you always hate it, but it happens, and hopefully you'd get some as well. But what I would tell you is we take retention really seriously because I believe even in those states that we lost, we ultimately, if we are innovative enough, we will find things to sell to them and that will take us up or above the top end of the range.","And so those losses don't take us off of that 2% to 4% at all. The losses that we had this year. But I would tell you this, retention over the next three years is important to us, and we are going to drive hard against it. We have had a couple good years of retention leading up to this one. I wasn't going to give you a two or three-year average of retention to feel good about myself because this year isn't where we want to be. But I think over the three-year period, we have got to show retention, because quite frankly, that broadens your ability to sell.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Great. And then my second question, just your comments on Anthem, finally sending you the RFP, is there any color you can add to that? Were there back and forth conversations between yourselves and the Anthem management team that finally brought this to fruition? Or was there something else? Just curious on the background of that.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, I can only speak from our side, which is, a little bit of the two things I would point to is one, that we have continued with the discovery and process and feel good about that process and we are about to begin the process of interviewing folks. And so there is that element of it, which I can't speak to beyond that. And then there is, other that we feel very good still about our position in that lawsuit.","As it relates to the RFP itself, all I would say is that there has been an exchange of communications between myself and Joe that ultimately led to, I believe, lead to the receipt of the pricing portion of the RFP.","What I'd say is this, though, Lisa, day-to-day, our teams are working really well with Anthem's team. Anthem has great people that we interface with. We've got great people that service Anthem. We continue to \u2013 they did some changes July 1 that went very well. Our IT folks are well integrated with each other to help when things are connected and they're doing new things.","So from a standpoint of the relationship, it's very functionally good at the executional level, and I think that I'm optimistic that they will ultimately conclude with the right party although my odds are still very low because I've had nothing in my communications back and forth to suggest that they're biased in our direction.","Lisa Gill - JPMorgan Chase & Co.","Thanks. I appreciate that. Thank you.","Operator","Next question, Brian Tanquilut, Jefferies. Your line is now open.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Hey. Good morning. Tim, just to follow up on one of your comments to Lisa's questions, so you mentioned something about if you were innovative. So where do you stand today as really the true stand alone or the sole stand alone in the industry, how do you feel about the need to evolve the company into something else, given that whether it's through innovation or partnering or vertically integrating into something else?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So I feel a very strong need over the next three years to evolve this company. There is no question. Our enterprise value initiative, I think, is a strong signal of that, because that is a lot more than just, you know, changing our footprint or swapping out workforces or being a little bit more efficient.","And as it relates to our openness to work with others in novel ways, I think last quarter you saw some evidence at least that we are very open to working with others. I can tell you we have conversations that are \u2013 it's early stage conversations with very interesting ideas as it relates to people we can work with to either help solve their problems or do things together.","We're in a great space in pharmacy, given where things are apt to strongly evolve our model as the market needs evolve. Biosimilars are one example of that. I sat with a CEO of a major top 10 pharma company that is a significant player in biosimilars, and we talked about some very interesting ways, Everett and I met with him this week or I guess it was last week, to think through how we could bring some things to the market in innovative ways.","So from our standpoint, the thing I like about our focused model is, it is all we talk about internally, is what else can we be doing with our asset, with our relationships, with our strong ability to manage patients and outcomes? And therefore, you should expect that we will continue to do things like we did in the second quarter.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","Got you. And then, Eric, as I look at the results, the Anthem book looked to have weakened in terms of margins this past quarter. Is there anything you would be able to call out in terms of the drivers there? And as I think about the enterprise value initiative, should we think of that as the savings primarily flowing through to the non-transitioned part of your book? Or do you need some of those savings to essentially get to the Anthem EBITDA that you're reporting today","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes. So let me answer the first part of that. The biggest change in the margin, which affects the total company and the Anthem year-over-year, is the annual contract true-up payment that we get in the second quarter. And if you look at that, last year versus this year, this year's payment was almost half of last year's. So that decrease is what's driving that year-over-year margin thing.","From the EVI perspective and the initiative, certainly, part of this is driven by the impacts. As we've said, whether Anthem rolls off or the rates get reduced, there's an impact to our margins come 2020 or 2021. But as you listened to what we talked about, all the things we're doing, the majority of these EVI initiatives we would be doing regardless of Anthem. The plus side is they're going to drive out a significant amount of costs that will offset some of that impact we're going to see in 2020 and 2021. So certainly it's a driver, but we're doing this, as I said, to be more competitive, to improve our company and help us better serve our patients, clients and customers.","Brian Gil Tanquilut - Jefferies LLC","I appreciate that. Thanks, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Next question, Ricky Goldwasser, Morgan Stanley. Your line's now open.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. So just one follow-up on the enterprise value initiative. Just to clarify, if you were to, under a scenario, were to lose Anthem, will the cost savings figure increase?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No. There is a moderate amount built into that savings number as it relates to Anthem variable cost, so if they stay, it could be slightly lower. But right now, our plan, the assumption is driven by them rolling off in 2020 and 2021.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then if we think about the 2018 growth algorithm, the 2% to 4% longer term \u2013 I think you talked earlier about the fact that we shouldn't think about the script growth and translate it necessarily to what you can do on the EBITDA line. So how should we think about how much of that 2% to 4% growth would come from cost cutting and WBAD versus other factors that might make up for the script loss?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","So I'll start, Ricky. First of all, I want to be really clear that the 2% to 4% was over a three-year period, and so for next year, we haven't actually given the guidance. But we certainly are working toward coming in at a range that people are going to feel good about and excited about. That said, the things that are going to drive us next year to come in high in that range for next year when we put our guidance out will be \u2013 the volume piece, as I said, is a relatively modest piece of it. It is going to be about driving supply chain value. It is going to be about getting cost out of the business in ways that transform us. Eric talked about a lot of them.","I mean, next year, if we can knock another 50 calls per 1,000 off of our mail service call volume, for example, we're going to have happier members, and we're going to have a smaller footprint in terms of folks who are having to talk to patients about where's my order and those kinds of things.","If we can move our e-Prior authorization up and begin to take a significant crack, as we have the last two years, those are the kind of things that are going to drive a lot of our cost initiatives next year. We have a good line of sight to some new generics and some other things in the supply chain that we think are going to drive, that were delayed this year that we think will drive client value as well as our ability to get to the top end of the range.","And then again, as I said, I'm very optimistic based on the uptake rates that we've have seen both in our SafeGuardRx programs and in our 90-day programs, that we're positioning ourselves for a fairly strong year in 2018.","I don't know if, Eric, is there anything you want to add to that?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","No, that covers it.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","And then one last question on the selling season. I know we've all been focused on retention rates, but can you talk a little bit about the profiles, the accounts, that you're winning in the selling season?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, so what I would say is it's been very good for us in the commercial market this year. We've been very pleased with that market. The large health plan market is pretty much \u2013 there's been nothing material that I can think of off the top of my head that's actually moved. A lot of that got pushed out into 2018 or 2019 as plans. Sort of we're waiting to see what's going to happen with Washington. We're assessing their own strategies and so forth.","So there's been less there, less government, and unfortunately, we actually have won in the state space as well as some of the local school districts and local municipalities and those kinds of things, we did win one state account that we talked about, but unfortunately it's not as big as the ones we lost. We happen to have probably more of the states that were out than our competitors did this year. So that's why I think we \u2013 and I've heard at least one competitor kind of describe it as kind of a light year this year.","Ricky R. Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question, Anthony Vendetti, Maxim Group. Your line is now open.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Thank you. Just to follow up on Anthem, you said in a filing that if you were to re-sign with Anthem, it would be on terms significantly less favorable. I'm just wondering when did you receive the pricing RFP from Anthem and is that the full RFP? And when do you have to respond? And just elaborate a little bit more on why you think the terms would be significantly less favorable. Did they put some guidelines in that RFP?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Sure. So let me start with we've been saying that since long before we received the RFP, and I'll explain why in just a second. But to answer your question in very specific terms, we received the pricing portion last week. We're going to be returning it. They would like it back this Friday and we intend to try to hit that date. And beyond that, I won't characterize it in any way. We're going to respond to what they have asked us for.","As it relates to the step down that we would anticipate, which is why this enterprise value initiative is so important, because even keeping Anthem, as you will recall, in 2009, the arrangement that we and Anthem entered into was a very unique arrangement. It was a purchase of their PBM. It had other facts and circumstances around it contractually that will not be in place come the renewal.","The renewal, or 2020 and beyond for us, if we're fortunate enough to receive it, or if they go some other place, will be a sort of commercially competitive bid that they're entitled to go get, because they will need to move their business from us to whomever gives them that bid, or keep their business with us, which is why we think we're the right choice. But we will have to compete at that point in sort of a traditional services bid, assuming that's the direction they even go.","So from that standpoint, recognizing that today, and we disclosed in the last quarter the kind of earnings we would have on Anthem, you would be well aware that those sorts of earnings per script are not what you would typically see in the more traditional PBM bid. So we would not expect to see our profit continuing post 2020.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","Okay. Just a quick follow-up. So right now, the EBITDA per script is significantly higher than it is for your core business, but that was because back in 2009, you paid an upfront fee to Anthem, which they used for various corporate purposes themselves, including repurchasing shares. So that's why it's so high now. In your traditional bid, you would expect it to be more in line, or because it's such an important contract maybe less than the average EBITDA per script; correct?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Broadly speaking, that's correct. That's what I would say. Yes. Thanks.","Anthony V. Vendetti - Maxim Group LLC","All right. Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","And operator, we'll take one more call, please. I know we're closing in on 9:30 Eastern.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question from Michael Cherny, UBS. Your line is now open.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Good morning, guys, and thanks for taking the question. I think the question was asked earlier today about the evolution of the market and obviously with noise around new players such as Amazon potentially coming in. As you think about potential partnerships with non-traditional players against the backdrop of how you reposition the company, I know you talked about technology investments, how does that all factor into this long-term evolution of the standalone PBM model of making sure that what's historically been a primarily B-to-B business can create some differentiation with B-to-C type applications? And I guess along those lines where do you think right now the industry, you included, falls short on the B-to-C side?","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Yes, it's a big question. I mean, what I would say is I think that our independent position in the marketplace is exactly the right position to be in now as you evaluate a very dynamic health care market, a very dynamic consumer market, and you look at our ability to flexibly work with players, gain, last quarter I can point to some stuff.","Again, the answer I gave you earlier on Amazon, something that we're not resistant to these sorts of potential opportunities if they benefit our clients and our patients. That's the bottom line. And so \u2013 or as we showed this quarter with Inside Rx, patients who are not ours but need the kind of things that we can bring to the market, i.e. these cash paying customers, I think that when you look at sort of our population and the members that we directly serve, they are well served by what we do, but they have a very high standard from what they expect from everybody in their life. And that standard has been \u2013 they've acquired that sort of view from working with really smart digital companies who make things very friction-free and very seamless.","And that's why as we look at when we do and the investments that we're going to make, a key component of those investments, it's not the only thrust, but the key component involves this whole notion of the patient, we have a thing we call the patient journey here, that we believe we can take a tremendous amount of cost out of, but more importantly, we can make a heck of a lot easier.","There's no question that paying for phone calls that people don't want to make for patients that we could otherwise serve in more efficient ways is a win-win-win. And so we think we can do a lot of that from our internal piece. But I can tell you as well again, leveraging technology partners, leveraging potentially other branded partners, we think there's a lot we can do. Working with the retail channel, using their brand where it makes sense if you look at some of the programs we have launched.","So, again, what I like about our model is we are able to work across the piece without being beholden to a particular asset that we are attached to. And the second piece is I am really proud of the team of 26,000 employees that work for this company who are driven to actually be innovative and drive at continuing to evolve our model.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","And just one really quick technical question for Eric. You had talked about M&A and capital deployment. Given what you've already done on buyback and with the debt maturity next year, what are your capacity constraints about pursuing M&A? Is there anything in particular we should be thinking about as we try and assess what areas you could think about moving in to?","Eric R. Slusser - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Well, really as we have talked about before, a lot of what we're focused on would be things that would be most likely cash\/debt-related acquisitions. So from that perspective, we don't see any near-term constraints. We can manage those and still manage our capital structure that we built into our long-term growth guidance.","Michael Cherny - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks.","Timothy C. Wentworth - Express Scripts Holding Co.","Guys, I thank you for dialing in today. We really appreciate you hanging with us this morning, and we obviously had a lot to go over. We're really pleased with what we're looking forward to doing, and I look forward to coming back and updating you next quarter on that.","Operator","Thank you.

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions) Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn to call to Mr. Chris McGinnis, Vice President of Investor Relations. You may begin.","Chris McGinnis","Thank you. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Call. With me today are George Paz, Chairman and CEO; Tim Wentworth, President; Cathy Smith, our CFO and other members of the senior management.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the Company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The Company\u2019s actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors, which are discussed in detail in the Company\u2019s most recent Form 10-K and Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We do not undertake any obligation to update or otherwise release publicly any revision to our forward-looking statements.","For clarity purposes, all financial numbers, except where indicated, that we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis and are attributable to Express Scripts excluding non-controlling interest representing the share allocated to members of our consolidated affiliates. This presentation will be posted on our website and includes an appendix with footnotes and the reconciliations of GAAP to adjusted numbers and EBITDA to net income. Please also refer to tables included in our earnings press release for a reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers that we will be discussing. The reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our press release. The press release is posted on the Investor Relations section of our website at www.express-scripts.com.","At this point, I will turn the call over to George.","George Paz","Thank you, Chris, and good morning, everyone. Chris, we welcome you to your first quarter as Vice President of Investor Relations. Chris has been a member of the Express Scripts team since 2008, serving in various capacities, but mostly recently Vice President and Associate General Counsel and Leader of our Business Development team. Chris is a certified public accountant and a member of the AICPA. He is well qualified to lead our Investor Relations group.","Today we will cover three topics. Cathy will review our third quarter financial performance and guidance, then Tim will provide a business update and finally I will provide context on our innovative solutions and how we\u2019re uniquely positioned to lower cost, manage healthcare trends and drive healthier outcomes.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Cathy.","Cathy Smith","Thanks, George, and good morning, everyone. Our first quarter results and overall financial performance were in line with our expectations. Adjusted claims were 328.3 million, consistent with our guidance range with home delivery and specialty claims increasing sequentially from 32 million last quarter to 33.1 million this quarter or 3.4%. This was primarily driven by our continued focus on mail order programs. This includes the adoption of aggressive mail programs by several of our clients in connection with their exchange offerings.","Year-over-year SG&A increased slightly, up 2% over the prior year excluding UnitedHealth Group. Although we\u2019re back to delivering service at historical levels, we are focused on setting new standards in service. Additionally, we continue to invest in innovative offerings to our clients while ramping up to prepare for a strong 1\/1 implementation.","Moving forward into 2015 in an increasingly complex regulatory environment, we are investing to ensure compliance with healthcare reform, CMS, and other regulations. We also have projects underway enabling us to promote home delivery and specialty with the goal of enhancing clients and member experience. As reflected in this quarter, we remain firmly committed to investing in our future.","EBITDA was up 8% from the prior year excluding United, while EBITDA per adjusted claim was up 13%. We continue to see an improvement attributable to supply chain performance including the performance of our 2014 National Preferred Formulary and better management of ingredient cost.","Post integration of Medco, we focused on achieving certain tax claim strategies in order to reduce our effective income tax rate. Our third quarter effective income tax rate improved from 37.9% to 37%. This improvement contributed $0.03 to EPS in the third quarter which will comprise of a cumulative effect of $0.02 for the first half of the year and a recurring improvement of $0.01. The lower effective income tax is due to recognizing tax benefits of certain permanent deductions. We operate in nearly every state in the country and continue to evaluate opportunities to drive down the recurring state tax rate in the future.","We reported EPS of $1.29, representing growth of 24% over last year excluding United. We achieved a solid financial performance notwithstanding the additional investments made to set new standards in service in preparation for a strong 1\/1 implementation. In addition, we\u2019ve generated $435.1 million of cash flow during the quarter and repurchased 14.1 million shares for $1 billion. As of the end of September, we had 28.8 million shares remaining under our share repurchase authorization.","With one quarter remaining, we are narrowing our 2014 earnings guidance to a range of $4.86 to $4.90 per diluted share. This range maintains the previously guided midpoint of $4.88 and represents growth of $18 and $19 year-over-year excluding United. As represented in the table, there are a few revisions to our guidance we provided last quarter. We narrowed total adjusted claims maintaining the previously guided midpoint. The midpoint range of our implied gross profit is $25 million higher than our previous guidance. This will be more than offset by an increase of $75 million in the midpoint of our SG&A range due to continued investments in service, 1\/1 preparedness and regulatory compliance. As a result, we are lowering the midpoint of our EBITDA range by $50 million.","As a result of our tax planning strategies, our full year adjusted effective income tax guidance range is improving to a midpoint of 37.7%. Consistent with last quarter, our diluted share range assumes approximately $1 billion of share repurchase in the fourth quarter. Based on year-to-date adjusted earnings per share of $2.51, this equates to a fourth quarter earnings per share range of $1.36 to $1.40. In summary, we delivered solid results with our overall financial performance in line with expectations.","I will now turn it over to Tim.","Tim Wentworth","","Thanks, Cathy and good morning. As the 2014 selling season winds down, retention remains in line with our previous expectations of 92% to 93%. While we do not identify specific client wins, we recently renewed several large clients including two major health plans. With our efforts taken in the first half of the year to improve service metrics and reshape our sales and account management service model, we remain focused on further fortifying our relationships, which is crucial to winning and retaining business. As we said last quarter, we expect 2015 claims volume to be down slightly to down 1.5% from the midpoint of our 2014 total adjusted claims guidance.","The healthcare landscape is evolving rapidly and we continually raise our standards to not only meet but exceed our clients' and members' needs. Our goal is to make it easy and rewarding for our clients and members to do business with us. We continue investing in our systems, processes and people which result in enhanced service to our clients and optimizes every member touch point. Our investment includes member experience, regulatory compliance and clinical programs, specialty and home delivery. In all cases, these investments drive and support deep relationships with our clients and our members and are critical to helping our client control drug trends. With our scale and differentiated assets, no other PBM can match our investments and infrastructure and in service delivery.","Again this quarter, we spent significant time collaborating with various stakeholders, including clients, benefit advisors, prospective clients and pharma. We recently hosted four key events. First, our second Annual Health Plan Conference; second, our Employer Advisory Council; third, our Federal Outcome Symposium; and fourth, our Annual Pharma Outcomes Conference. Each conference hosted a stakeholder group with unique perspectives and with a common goal of navigating the complex healthcare environment. More recently, we leveraged their inputs to help tackle unsustainable costs associated with compounds and medications used to treat hepatitis C.","Our Annual Pharma Outcomes Conference, which is a forum for interactive discussions between manufacturers and our PBM, Accredo and the UBC business, hosted discussions on new drugs coming to market and the importance of restricted formularies and how our model is driven and supported by clients to bring significant value to the healthcare marketplace. The level of participation, collaboration and forward thinking at each of our conference gives us confidence that our model continues to lead the way to lower costs while providing healthier outcomes.","We have a unique insight in prescription trends and earlier this month we released our second research study summarizing how exchange members are utilizing their prescription drug benefit. Exchange patients use the benefit at a similar rate to those in a traditional commercial plan with some key exceptions. Notably, these patients are taking more generic drugs, but have a higher utilization of specialty drugs, creating a tremendous need for what we do. Health plan clients who utilize our PBM and specialty pharmacy solutions are positioned to grow and compete very effectively in healthcare exchanges. From a long-term perspective, this is an important component of our growth.","I will now turn it over to George.","George Paz","","Thank you, Tim.","We have a history of being innovative and adapting to the changing healthcare landscape. The work of our PBM continues to be critical to improving health outcomes while controlling cost. Clients are facing unprecedented cost increased driven by double-digit brand inflation, the continued 15% to 18% inflation of specialty drugs and overwhelming regulatory burden. Clients need innovative solutions to manage this unacceptable drug trend. Consumers are also taking a more proactive approach in managing their healthcare decisions. These trends represent growth opportunities for us and allows us to use our scale, alignment and innovation to create solutions such as home delivery programs, narrow networks, restricted formularies and specialized care.","Clients are looking to control costs and are demanding innovative solutions for healthier outcomes. Our team of experts combined three capabilities to drive better decisions and healthier outcomes. These are actionable data, behavioral sciences and clinical specialization. These capabilities serve as a foundation for our Health Decision Science which enables us to foster better collaboration, accelerate innovation and create industry\u2019s most innovative suite of solutions. Our newly expanded lab combines our clinical experts and research analysts along with innovative technologies and the disciplines of Health Decision Science. We\u2019ve had more than 100 clients come to St. Louis to visit our newly expanded lab in the last two months, including the majority of our health plan clients. And all of them are working with us to find new ways to innovate and identify specific solutions for their challenges.","Furthermore, our lab features clinical specialist representing four of our 15 therapeutic resource centers: oncology, diabetes, pulmonary and neuroscience. Our clinical specialists are focused on addressing the most complex and costly conditions associated with these members. Our specialists often treat 10 times as many cases as a specialist physician. This results in a deep understanding of the disease stage which results in increased adherence, reduced cost and healthier outcomes while providing a better member experience.","The lab embodies our passion for member care and continuing alignment with client needs. One example of how we use our lab and apply Health Decision Science to manage pharmacy spend for our clients is our innovative program to manage waste in compound drug spend. The change in the national coding system for drugs created increased transparency, but also increased an opportunity for some providers to drastically increase compound ingredient prices. In 2013, unmanaged compound drug spend increased from an average cost per claim of $273 to $708. Responding to this dramatic increase, we partnered with our clients to address the changing landscape of prescription compounding. Within our lab, we created a comprehensive program designed to exclude select ingredients within compounds. We launched our compound management solution in June of 2014. Our solution quickly, safety and reliably excluded 95% of compound spend for our clients while ensuring clinically appropriate care with very little disruption for our clients and our members. This is one example of the innovation and creativity that occurs in our lab every day.","This concludes our prepared remarks and we\u2019ll be happy to take any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we\u2019re ready to begin the question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from Lisa Gill with JPMorgan. Your may ask your question.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","George, if you think about this strategy of the Company, there has been a lot of questions around the PBM retail model. And clearly many of the retailers are having a very difficult time right now around reimbursement. Do you see opportunities to work more closely with the retailers? In some ways many of the things you\u2019ve talked about where mail narrow network, narrow formularies or restricted formularies, et cetera, but not really talking about a more collaborative approach with a drug retailer. I was just wondering maybe if you could give us any update around that.","George Paz","Absolutely, one of our key components of our supply chain management is not just to go out and try to get lower price. I mean that\u2019s important as we gauge inflation and the changing marketplaces, brands lose their patent production and there is new generic launches or restrictions in the number of generics on the market. All that takes a lot of management. But just as important, especially to our clients, is the overall management of their drug trend. And so partnering with key pharmacies and our narrower networks really does pay off in a big way when they can help us enforce formulary decision making as well as drive generic fill rates. So there is a lot we do with the retail network.","Mail is still by far though the biggest advantage we have in ultimately getting people on the right formulary drug and giving the right options, because keep in mind, somebody\u2019s not paying at the counter. It's a much different situation when somebody is at the counter, they have leave and come back. If we get the drug in and we want to mail it withing 24 hours, we still have the chance to call the doctor\u2019s office. If the doctor approves it, make the appropriate changes and get a new prescription to get the drug out the door which can have a significant impact. So although we do partner closely with the retail drug stores, mail still is a key strategic advantage for us.","Lisa Gill \u2013 JPMorgan","But if you look at this, clearly you\u2019re somewhat at odds with the retailers. You\u2019re talking about mail order and your opportunities around mail and they would like people to come into the store. Could you see something where you would work much more closely maybe a JV or a more of a synthetic type of relationship where it's much more closely aligned where if it's beneficial for the patient to get mail order, you can then see that the pharmacist actually counseling that person and therefore that pharmacy getting some of your economics on the back end and you getting increased savings on front end if the person picks up the prescription there? Have you thought about any of those types of relationships just in light of the fact that CVS and Caremark have done pretty well together over the last few years?","George Paz","","There's a couple of things there. Unfortunately I guess when I sit back, Lisa, and I just kind of look at where we are today, it's kind of hard to figure out how well CVS Caremark really did relative to the rest of the marketplace, just to be totally frank. I know they've got a lot of improved volume as we got into our little spat with Walgreens a few years back, that was a huge opportunity for CVS to gain a significant amount of share. And give credit to Larry and his team, they did a great job of maintaining that and that was a big boost for them. And since then we've gone through over two years of integration activities with Medco. And so we've seen, as you know, our retention rates are not what we would have liked them, but that's part of the acquisition, it's part of the cost of a deal in getting our companies aligned and together. And so the recipient of a lot of that has been CVS Caremark.","I think the real tale to take will be over the next several years now, now that our service level has stabilized, David Queller has joined our team and is focused on strengthening and changing our approach to the marketplace, he's made incredible strides in that area. We've got a real focus on client relationships. And the question is, how does it play out overtime. I think it's great when you have a really strong partner such as CVS has in Caremark, there's a lot of good things you can do. But I don't think that's mutually exclusive. When we partner up with the retailers and we form our narrow networks, we do the same thing they do. If you go outside that narrower network, you can still get your drug, you just pay a higher co pay. The retailers inside that network, they make more money when then dispense a generic than they do a brand. So there is a real economic alignment between us, our clients, our members and our patients to get people on board. We have report cards out to show how they're doing with respect to formulary compliance. So there is a lot that can be done and a lot being done to partner with them. I don't know that you have to own them and make the capital investment in order to get those benefits.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Willoughby with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. You may ask your question.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","","George and Cathy, is there any estimate on the remaining Medco synergy amount that maybe attainable income statement balance sheet wise? And then just secondarily, there is a reference in the Q about a tax dispute on PolyMedica that's fairly significant. Is there a reasonable timeframe for a resolution there?","George Paz","","A couple of things. With respect to the synergies that they won, Robert, as you know, is really on the balance sheet side. We are in the process of putting in our inventory systems across all of our sites and that's got -- it came a little late. We intended to do that earlier in the year. But because we were focused on filling some gaps with respect to our integration activities and getting service levels back up to where they needed to be, which they are now, with that a lot of those projects got delayed. So we haven't seen the value of those systems, they're not in yet in order to reduce inventory. And we were going through all those activities, we still have a lot of room, in my opinion, to still manage the balance sheet better and drive working capital to a better position.","So I think those synergies are yet to come, not so much on the income statement side. A lot of the costs that are pent up, that will go away, are these integration costs. So those aren't really synergies per se since they are not running through the adjusted GAAP numbers.","I don't know, Cathy, if you would like to add anything to that.","Cathy Smith","","Yeah. So I agree with what George has said with regards to the synergies. All of the -- it is largely, the buying synergies were achieved early on in an acquisition and it's really more on the balance sheet side which rather we have spoken about. To answer your question around the tax receipts, we have always been benefited for some time and it just takes \u2013 these things take time. So no new news and we will continue to push this.","George Paz","","Just to follow up though real quick on the synergies side. What we have been able to accomplish with our national preferred formulary over the last two years has been really a huge windfall for us and our clients and our members that wouldn't have been possible had we not done the Medco deal and gained the size that we have. And over the first year, many of our clients both on the Medco and Express Scripts side, over 90% of them, joined into the national corporate formulary. We are getting comparable type numbers this year. So we are really excited about it. So all those synergies per se aren't there in the same way. I think the scale and buying power will go on forever.","Robert Willoughby \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch","And to Lisa's question, George, you answered the PBM side of things quite well. I just wonder have you assessed the opportunity of being able to drive Walgreens market share much higher if you physically own the asset?","George Paz","Well, I did not address that, did I? I believe that there is probably upside in that. I mean I think what you would do is you design program similar to what CVS Caremark has. I don't think we want to get into specific situations and specific opportunities. We've got a big team of people here that analyze and I think we try to always make sure we do what's in the best interest of our shareholders. You are talking about a lot of capital outlay. And so before we would ever venture down any kind of opportunity like that, we really want to make sure the rates of return there, there is a proven track record and it's really going to succeed for the long term and I think school is still out on that a little bit.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley. You may ask your question.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","So George, I know generic inflation has been a growing issue for the drug retailers. Can you talk about kind of like your perspective and if there are any plans to adjust the contrast to a confluence of new dynamics? And also, are you seeing -- what are you seeing in terms of generic inflation for chronic medications that are dispensed in mail, i.e. is this something that could have an impact on you as well?","George Paz","","There is any given year, probably more recently than in the past, you see drugs with inflationary impacts that come in. The question is when we do our contracting with our clients, we try to take into consideration the impact of our -- the contracts we have with our wholesalers and manufacturers. And so we enter into three-year contracts with our clients and they are setting a rate and that rate takes -- tries to take into consideration all new compounds that are losing or all new drugs that are losing their patent protections, the impact of the size of those drugs are going to have where there will be two, five, 10 competitors in the generic marketplace. We try our best to understand what's happened to the API marketplace and the impact that's going to have on pricing and we enter into longer term contracts with our manufacturers.","And the idea is we try to shelter our patients and our clients from variations and volatility and short term price movements. I think our supply chain does an incredible job with that. And although we do see some of that, most of it is covered through contractual arrangements and really at the end of the day it hasn\u2019t had an impact on us today. As far as the retail drug stores, we do the same thing with them. We sit down, these are very sophisticated providers of service, so they know what's going on in their marketplace. We sit down and we negotiate rates which then inform the rates that our clients get and that's the way the process works. So we're pretty much contractually protected from short term swings and I like our position.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley","","And then one follow-up question. Last quarter you introduced your '15 preliminary script guidance. Now that we are getting closer to year end, can you just kind of like share with us how you kind of like feel about trends around scripts as we head into next year?","George Paz","","One thing I want to be careful of is I don't want to repeat mail guidance. I don't want to -- the next question will be about next year's revenue and the next one about EBITDA per script. So we have given forward look at script counts for 2015. I'll let Tim address that in just a second, but what I don't want to do on this call is we will give guidance during the first quarter for 2015. So I don't want to go up on tangents here. So Tim, if you want to address the script issue.","Tim Wentworth","","As I said in the prepared remarks, we are confirming that what we see for next year is slightly down to down 1.5% from the midpoint of where we said we would end this year. That has not changed. We feel good about that. And what I would also tell you is the assumption around specifically utilization is pretty much flat for next year in terms of our book of business. So we have not got any uptick there that would be driving that number in a different place.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse. You may ask your question.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","","Cathy, I just wanted to talk about the profitability in the current quarter. It seems to have stepped down a little bit sequentially from where we were in 2Q. And just kind of looking at the full year fiscal '14 guidance, it kind of implies I think a reasonable step up in profitability into the fourth quarter. And so I was wondering if you could just talk about maybe some of the factors that may be weighed on profitability this quarter. I think you talked about the investments in SG&A, but curious if there was anything else and then if you can help us think about that transition into 4Q and maybe why the profitability gets better if that's even the correct assumption.","Cathy Smith","","As you said, we did see -- we are seeing more investment in SG&A this quarter and then as we said with our guidance for the remainder of the year, anticipate to continue to do that. And because of investing in member service, regulatory compliance, as we said. That said, why we do see a step up next quarter is timing of supply chain initiatives as well as the timing of our Part D business and the profitability tends to come in the fourth quarter as well.","Glen Santangelo - Credit Suisse","Maybe if I can just follow up with a question for Tim. Tim, I think you kind of mentioned in your prepared remarks that you had a number of new wins. And I know you don't specifically call out new client wins, but I was kind of curious if you can maybe give us a sense for now that the selling season is done, maybe how successful were you in this selling season? Because I think last quarter, a lot of us kind of struggled with the 92% to 93% retention rate along with the script count only being down 1% to 1.5%. I am just trying to reconcile those two facts. I guess you concluded that there was a fair amount of new business wins and it seems like the company is spending a lot of money for 1\/1 preparedness. I am just kind of curious if you can frame the selling season on how successful you were to help us maybe reconcile that script number a little bit more closely.","","Tim Wentworth","","As you say, it\u2019s kind of -- it's all in there. When you look at the slightly down 1.5% with the 92% to 93% retention, which obviously we've reconfirmed that today as well, what I would say Glenn is retention wasn't where we wanted it to be and we said that. And we are very pleased with the recent renewals which are significant 1\/1\/16 renewals. That being said, the selling season itself was a good one. I am not going to tell you it was a let off, but it was a good solid selling season combined with having the right clients who are growing as well. So the organic growth inside of the book of business that we have retained and we continue to have a very strong relationship and a strong forward looking set of activities with will be combined well. And I think that's one of the things as you see over the next number of quarters and frankly years, that organic component is going to get increasingly important as our health plan book of business drives significant growth in their volumes as soon as we get the right partners. And we certainly feel that we do have a number of just terrific partners there.","So when you add that whole piece up together, some great new name wins that we had, retention right where we want it, but a very strong organic growth from the clients that we've retained and are growing with.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Percher with Barclays. You may ask your question.","Eric Percher \u2013 Barclays","I will follow along that line. Now that we are fairly far through the selling season, I wonder if you could share some of the lessons learned. And particularly with respect to the locks that you put in place for fiscal year '14 in specialty, now are you seeing incremental movement on specialty formulary management and how do you think about changes as you go into '15? And maybe is there a piece of your book that's taking on a more aggressive approach to specialty management than we see in the national formulary?","George Paz","I will chime in here first and then I am going to turn it over to Tim. But I think the lesson's learned -- that's a great question. And I think when we went into this year, this finally into '14 with our integration plans, we'd assumed that we are going to be able to convince a lot of clients to use the gap fix as we had in place, we've got them over to the Medco system. And at the end of the day, because of some of our integration challenges at the beginning of the year, that didn't turn out the way we would have liked. And what you see and you've seen some pretty bigger numbers in our integration spend over the last couple of quarters and that really is building out the functionality that existed on the Express Scripts platform that we\u2019ve put on to the Medco platform that we thought initially we weren't going to have to do. And that's caused a delay in finishing the integration program and it's caused us to spend a bit more money there.","But quite frankly, I think what we've -- at the end of the day, it really is about meeting client needs and objectives and delivering the highest levels of service. Those are just given to compete in almost any industry. And probably if we wouldn't have had any integration hiccups, we probably could have got by without filling some of the gaps. But that didn't occur and so we had to step up. And I think we have been very successful with that. As Tim said, we've renewed quite a bit of our large accounts that [indiscernible] 92% that came up for this year to 93%, plus we feel like we are starting to make some good headway for '16 now. And so I think we are in the right position. Tim, I don't know if you want to add anything.","Tim Wentworth","","I think what I would amplify is that the relationship we have with the client matters a great deal. And as we talked last quarter, where we had some locked folks and some disruption of that, it was harder to recover. We feel very good about where we are now. George mentioned Dave Queller joining and Dave has a whole team of really terrific folks that I think have our relationships in a very, very good place and we are continuing to evolve that. So clearly the lesson is about service manners, both at the member level and the client level.","I would also say that service mattering is widely NPF or our national preferred formulary was so successful and why 90% of our clients are on that formulary now in the commercial book of business, why none of them have moved backwards and why we have actually continued to add clients for 2015 and that's because in the case of that formulary, those members were managed in a very, very positive way and clients felt very good about that and the savings that they got.","To your specific question about specialty, that's one of the reasons I think clients have clearly adopted the formulary as we moved beyond the small molecules to specialty on that formulary to going in five classes for 2014 and we've added some additional products for '15 and helping manage that spend, because long-term I can tell you, the other lesson learned is, the better job we do managing our clients throughout the trend and spend, the more likely it is that they are going to renew with us particularly if we have a strong service relationship.","Eric Percher - Barclays","So it sounds like the service element is key to getting trust that you need in order to actively manage and some of that may have been delayed versus your initial goal. And now as you go into '15, does that mean you are trying to up the heat on trying to push for more aggressive management or looking for adoption of that in your book?","Tim Wentworth","","No question about it. Every conversation we are having with clients -- now this is the rewarding part of kind of being through this integration and now leaning towards the clients is the conversations that we are having. We mentioned the number of clients that have come to our lab and in none of our book of business that we\u2019ve interacted with directly or through representative groups like our employer advisory group, the conversation is all about that now.","Eric Percher \u2013 Barclays","And quickly, there is a lot of attention relative to Sanofi and Lantus pricing pressures. And without speaking to direct class of product, as you look at 2015, did you see any major changes or increased aggressiveness relative to products that might not have looked like they had substitutes that were at the P&T Committees have found other alternatives?","Tim Wentworth","Obviously what I\u2019d say is, to answer your question, 2015 we were able to save the clients probably half or more of what they saved incrementally in '14 with one quarter of the disruption in large part because that\u2019s exactly what has happened, is that the manufacturers realized that it\u2019s very important to support access to these numbers.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Kreger with William Blair. You may ask your question.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","So maybe a follow-up about the National Preferred Formulary. Can you give us a sense in 2015 about how much of your book will be flowing through the formulary and how that might have changed versus '14?","Tim Wentworth","So the best way to think about it probably is -- that formulary, and I haven\u2019t looked at the final count, because literally we\u2019ve seen some significant folks that were looking at it for '14, now adopted for '15. It\u2019s well over 25 million members now that are on that single formulary.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","And again, what would you have said that would have been perhaps a year ago?","Tim Wentworth","A year ago this time I probably would have told you we\u2019re in the low 20s. Again, we\u2019ve penetrated nearly 90% of the commercial book of business coming right out of the chute and certainly in mid 80s and now we\u2019re up to 90. What I would also say tell you that it is probably more relevant, even though it doesn\u2019t show through yet in terms of what you see, is the number of health plans with whom we\u2019re having discussions around the same dynamic and helping them build formularies that are going to help them to win in their marketplaces. The competition level is giving us a sense that the 25 million plus members in our commercial book of business and our direct book are representative, but it's not the only part of the story as it relates to managing aggressive formulary through us as a solution.","John Kreger \u2013 William Blair","And maybe the same question around narrow networks. Can you give us a sense of how much of your book in '15 will be using some sort of a narrow network product?","Cathy Smith","I'm thinking 20%.","Tim Wentworth","Yeah, that's what I would have said. We continue to see interest in narrow networks and I think, you heard Cathy, it's somewhere probably just off the 20%.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs. You may ask your question.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Just want to go back to SG&A. Obviously you\u2019ve stepped up sequentially both in an absolute term and also as a percent of sales. I know Cathy did highlight some of this in your prepared remark. But if I go back, I saw the original message around this year as far as spending. Was that there were still areas of the business to take cost out in light of such things as UNH rolling off and the ongoing Medco integration. I guess maybe just what changed, if you could give a little bit more detail on what areas you are spending on today that you weren\u2019t contemplating coming into this year? And then are there still significant areas of cost that can come out?","George Paz","So one of the big things of course is around what we said earlier which is that we had to fill the gaps. Once we got passed 1\/1 and the integration left us a little disappointed. Meeting with our clients, there were certain functionalities and gaps that had to be filled which finally had to keep the lights on and keep the power running on those systems which caused integration cost to go up as we filled out the gaps, but the ongoing cost also are there. And so those things came back to get us a little bit during the course of the year.","There is still -- those plans still exist. We're still going to deactivate as soon as we get the gaps filled we\u2019ll deactivate the systems and move on and ultimately see those savings. So, there are synergies if you will with respect to some SG&A savings that are going to come out over the next year. But when I was talking about Robert\u2019s question around -- I was talking about the big-big synergies around purchasing and those type of things, but there will be some cost savings that will continue to come out as we go forward.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And then Tim, I just go back to the selling season, despite the lower retention rate, you guys have obviously been very successful in winning new businesses here and it sounds like you were able to renew some big clients recently. Given that mix and profitability around new and renewed business is such a significant swing factor to profit, is there any sense directionally you can give us on just how the new and renewed business compares to previous years on a pricing basis?","Tim Wentworth","All I\u2019d say is it\u2019s been for 16 years that I\u2019ve been in this business, it was highly competitive but rational. And obviously when we in the first quarter give you guidance, you\u2019ll get a better sense of that. But I\u2019d say that it was competitive, it was rational.","Robert Jones \u2013 Goldman Sachs","But no real difference from previous years?","Tim Wentworth","I wouldn\u2019t say anything significantly different from previous years as a trend now.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bret Jones with Oppenheimer. You may ask your question.","Bret Jones - Oppenheimer","I really just wanted to touch on the organic growth you guys talked about in terms of you\u2019ve seen the strength within claims there. Does that indicate any kind of mix shift impact that we should be concerned about from margins as it may be more geared towards health plans rather than employers?","Cathy Smith","Yeah. So obviously we are not going to talk about the PCL guidance in the next year, as George already said, that will give you a complete picture of when we give our 2015 guidance. But as we've already said, we did have great success in mitigating some of the 92% to 93% retention with the combination of the new sales and the organic growth in our book.","George Paz","","Just to follow on, to the extent -- there is some misinformation out there that believes that the commercial client is worth so much more than a health plan, it's worth so much more than this that or the other, it's client by client and it really depends on what their formulary decisions are and what their network decisions are. A client that comes in and wants to put in a very strong formulary program limiting the number of brands, driving generics, putting in high differentials in co-pay where appropriate, those things have huge impacts to both their trends and to our profitability. And that could be a health plan just easily as it could be a commercial plan, as it could be a government plan, as it could be you name a plan.","So I don't -- clearly a fair amount of the growth is coming inside of health plans. But as Tim said earlier, some of our drivers, as Cathy had said, is coming out of our mail growth which is also being driven by our health plans and there are decisions they made around the exchange programs and those are very good programs for us as well as for our members. So I don't want you to think because a health plan gets a certain amount or a commercial plan does this, that's fairly an indicator of future profitability. It really depends on how well they manage their trend and what they allow us to do to work with them to do that. And again, I don't want to piece mail guidance here, we will do that in the first quarter.","Bret Jones - Oppenheimer","","And just to kind of follow up on what you were talking about in terms of the mail program. Is there any way you could parse out how much of the sequential mail growth is really tied to ACA and maybe some mandatory mail programs that are part of those plans?","George Paz","No, I don't think we've ever done that before. Mandatory mail programs aren't as big as they used to be. Those were huge drivers of commercial plans to make decisions around controlling cost. Some still do it, some still implement them. But I think today, there is more and more people buying internet-based products and buying over the internet. And I think that's -- so we are seeing a lot of drive in being able to get people familiar with our programs and then driving those behaviors to go to mail. And again it's a much more convenient program, shows up on your doorstop every 90 days. If you sign up for a refill, you get it every 90 days. You don't have to call us or think about it. It just shows up. It's a great program and it works.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Steven Valiquette with UBS. You may ask your question.","Steven Valiquette - UBS","","So a couple of quick things here and I guess first, there's obviously been a lot of discussion about a mid-term market check related to long-term well playing contracts. I am just curious if you can just maybe address that topic in a bit more detail as everyone keeps bringing it up?","And then separately just to clarify, thinking ahead of next summer's 2016 selling season, I guess where we have cycled through most of the customers that may have been a little unhappy with the Express Scripts Medco merger such that all else being equally, retention rates should become more normalized or could there still be some lingering modest retention risk for the 2016 selling season relation to merger?","George Paz","","So to start with the WellPoint situation. WellPoint is a great company and a great partner. We are doing some phenomenal things together. We don't talk about specific client situations and I don't want to negotiate over these conference calls or anything else. I think we've got a great relationship with them. We still have five years plus left on the contract. We love servicing them and our relationship is very strong and sound and we're going to continue this relationship and we will let you know as things unfold.","As far as the selling season and retention...","Tim Wentworth","As I said earlier, there is probably some risk of clients that were not happy, certainly going out to bid when they might not have for example, but we feel that we are well positioned to compete there. But you could see some retention risk. When we give the guidance in the first quarter, I think we are going to give you a good, pretty good line of sight to that. But it is the tail of it, let me be very clear about that.","Operator","","Thank you. The next question comes from Garen Sarfian with Citigroup. You may ask your question.","Garen Sarfian - Citigroup","","Want to touch on exchanges. Could you elaborate on what you are seeing in both the public and the private exchanges from your managed care client base, your important client base? And related to that, how do you think the profile of the member going through these exchanges are changing?","George Paz","","Sorry, your second part of your question again?","Garen Sarfian - Citigroup","Just the profile of a member that goes through these exchanges, well of course more specifically for Express Scripts, but overall in general.","Tim Wentworth","So what I would tell you is that in terms of the public exchanges, each health plan experience is something different based on their strategy. So some of our health plans, we really want to grow share and again are looking to grow share. Some are looking to protect the share. They've got to keep it and make it more profitable or make it profitable. And some are not getting gain even. So what I would tell you is from a public exchange perspective, it really varies. But what we see inside of it is, is that the membership that they've got, as I said before, are typically fairly cost sensitive and also a bit, in many cases, somewhat sicker. But again, we have very large health plans that didn\u2019t get somewhat sicker folks because they really were targeting differently. So it really depends.","As it relates to the private exchanges, I call tell you that it\u2019s been a much less active year this year in our book of business. And I would think that the profile generally of those members in the private exchanges that even we have lost or others have put in there tend to be lower paid lower skilled workers in the industries where they may have high turnover. And from our perspective, at least so far as I look back over two years, relatively low utilizers, relatively younger, relatively higher turnover populations. And we\u2019ve not seen a significant move of more what I call established employers with higher or mixed skilled workforces are dropping into the private exchanges.","Garen Sarfian - Citigroup","And then just a follow-up on utilization, even this year alone, we\u2019ve seen some indications that there is still continued uptick in utilization, but your guidance really just narrows it around the midpoint. So just wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more as to why you\u2019re not seeing some of the things in utilization that others have, if there is any change in your views in the past few months.","Tim Wentworth","There are no significant changes in our views the last few months. We continue to -- we're looking pretty much a flat utilization. I think when you look at our client mix and some other things, I think that that probably explains some of it. But I would also say to some point on -- going out aggressively at compounds more quickly than most of the rest of the market did is the shift in utilization. So therefore we\u2019re very focused on managing for our clients. And I think to a very large extent that differential which is very hard to see the numbers that we share with you guys don\u2019t show up in the utilization in our book of business. And so I think you take that mix combined with the fact that we\u2019re very aggressively managing these things and it shows up as a flatter utilization than you see in the broader marketplace.","Garen Sarfian - Citigroup","Well, we always welcome more information and numbers, Tim, as you guys know. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Next question comes from David Larsen with Leerink Partners. Your may ask your question.","David Larsen - Leerink Partners","Can you talk about gross margin as a percentage of revenue? Did that come in where you guys were expecting? And then what impact, if any, did the hep C therapeutic class have on your numbers? And then are you seeing or do you expect to see other competing drugs that can compete effectively with Sovaldi?","George Paz","A couple of things and maybe Dr. Miller you want to you want to talk a little bit about hep C when I get done. I think the margins clearly -- the margins came in where we had anticipated and forecasted. The impact of Sovaldi obviously has a -- is driving revenues and is driving trend for our clients which is a huge challenge for us, for all of us in the healthcare because cost of these drugs are very expensive. And the recipient of a lot of these problems is our state plans. The prison population has a high incidence of hepatitis C. The Medicaid plans have high incidents of hepatitis C and the states are trying to come to grips with how to take these things on, how to take on these burdens and these costs and there is a lot activity going on there. But it is -- all of our plans obviously are seeing the impact of this type of achievement coming to marketplace and it\u2019s creating an inflationary high trend impact on our growth.","Steve, if you want to...","Steve Miller","I think as you know, this is actually one of the most controversial topics that we have in front of all of our clients. Our clients -- Sovaldi is a great drug, it\u2019s truly revolutionary, it can cure hepatitis C and we\u2019re very excited about making sure the appropriate patients get the treatment and so we have been dispensing a lot of Sovaldi.","On the flip side, the cost of it is unsustainable for many of our plans, as George pointed out, especially those state plans that have the dual burden of both the Medicaid populations and the prison populations. We\u2019re very excited that in the next 60 days there should be competitors in the marketplace. AbbVie should have a product out there. We\u2019re hoping that they take a different approach when it comes to pricing because many of our clients would love to move market share to a product that has great clinical outcomes at a lower cost. And then if you look out into the future, especially by 2017, there will be tremendous number of competitors out there and we believe that many patients actually can be held appropriately to that point in time when we have a lot of competition at lower cost so we could have the same great clinical outcomes but at greater affordability.","Tim Wentworth","Steve, if I could add one thing. For the first time we launched our 2014 formulary with the 25 plus million members on it with an asterisk on it, similar to Barry Bonds' home run record, and except the asterisk for us is, gives us the opportunity in the middle of the year when these drugs come out to change the formulary midstream rather than waiting until January 1st formulary when typically you would have seen changes. So these dynamic categories have such incredibly high potential costs and potential savings to be properly managed that we've published that and that sends a clear message to the manufacturers and it's something that we are empowered by clients who trust us to move these patients even midyear.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Vendetti with Maxim Group. You may ask your question.","Anthony Vendetti - Maxim Group","","Just as we move into the 2016 selling season and I know it's early, what's going to be the differentiator? I mean other than price, is it the TRCs that you'd established? And I know you've talked about how that was a major coup in acquiring Medco. But is it the TRCs or is there something else -- are there three things that you go into every clients like here's why you need to hire us?","Tim Wentworth","I think it\u2019s very straightforward. It's kind of back to what we said the lesson is learned, which by the way our lessons we have been learning for 16 years in this business when we get it right versus when we have challenging years and that is, it's about client service on the PBM side and on the pharmacy side it is about the specialization and the results that that delivers for clients and members to build the trust that enables you to do a better job of managing. Because at the end, these clients, that's what they are looking for from us is terrific relationship that they trust and then the ability to deliver measurable results in terms of the programs that we put into place. And so our innovation, I don't think it's any mystery why a significant number -- I mean last week we had the CEO and his entire staff of a huge health plan spend a day and a half with us in the lab and collaborating on a number of things. These guys are looking for solutions and the PBM that does the best job of building the trusted relationship at the client level and then delivering solutions to the member level that managed class and effective care that was going to win.","Operator","","Thank you. Our next question comes from Charles Rhyee with Cowen & Company. You may ask your question.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Company","Just a quick question, Cathy, on just looking at the guidance around the tax rate in particular, just trying to figure out. I know you are not giving '15 guidance per se, but is there anything in the tax rate that you've kind of achieved here that shouldn't persist going forward?","Cathy Smith","","So there is a non-recurring piece that wouldn\u2019t persist, that was [indiscernible] but then there is a recurring element that would go forward in our effective tax rate.","George Paz","","And that's the rate that she spoke to beyond the [multiple speakers].","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Company","","I will look into that for later. As we think about other categories, you talked about some of the big, you kind of referred to some of the things with the diabetes a little bit. Are there any other categories you see coming down the road that have similar characteristics to that that we should kind of keep an eye on where you think that there is more opportunities to create large savings for your clients?","George Paz","","That's a function of drug launches and utilization and price disparities between clinically equivalent drugs. But there is -- if a given manufacturer or a given therapy class starts raising their prices faster than the others in the class, that's what gives us opportunity the same way. Likewise, that if a given manufacturer is willing to offer deeper and deeper rebates in order to gain market share, that gives us the opportunity. So it really is something we analyze every year. We don't just wait to see what's happening in the marketplace.","Our supply chain people are out in the field on a daily basis visiting with all the pharma manufacturers and understanding where they're at, what their market needs are there, where they want to go with their product in trying to help them to buy device strategies in order to penetrate our book at the right prices. So it's a very interactive process. As Tim said during his prepared remarks, we have our -- every year we host a pharma outcomes conference here in St. Louis where we bring all the big pharma companies together to make sure they understand where we are headed, what we are trying to accomplish and then we visit with them throughout the year in order to try to coordinate that to get down to forming formularies each and every year. So it's a very interactive process.","Charles Rhyee - Cowen & Company","Then I guess the other way to ask it then is as you look out, have you kind of -- do you see categories, without maybe going into it, have you kind of isolated potential other areas, other categories that you see, maybe some of these same characters start to develop that you think you can be able to drive for the savings?","George Paz","This is not a static situation. So last year we rolled out our National Preferred Formulary which affected more people that had a huge impact. It was still 2%, but it still had a big impact on spend. This year for a much smaller percentage of the population we had a very significant impact and we are already formulating and planning for a year from now when we roll out. So it really depends -- we've got ideas, but it really also depends on those pharma companies and what they are doing. So we will have to see how it plays out overtime.","We have -- I think there is only one more question left in the queue. Why don\u2019t we go ahead and take that and then we will bring it to an end.","Operator","","Thank you. And our next question comes from George Hill with Deutsche Bank. You may ask your question.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank","Tim, maybe a quick one for you is that as we look out, we are hearing from the benefits consultants industry that a lot of the RFPs for the bigger clients for 1\/1\/16 starts are out, going out now. I guess can you talk about just in general how much of the book is out to bid for 1\/1\/16 and then I would say also not from not only your clients going out to bid, but other firm\u2019s clients are going out to bid. I guess can you talk about -- so how much of the book is out for 1\/1\/16 and then what kind of opportunity do you see in the selling season for 1\/1\/16 start? And then I have a quick follow-up for Cathy.","Tim Wentworth","What I would tell you is, as I said, it\u2019s early. We have less out for 1\/1\/16 than we have the last couple of years. And as I mentioned, we\u2019re pleased with some recent renewals about that. But we also -- and looking at the pipeline of proposals that we\u2019re looking at, what I would tell you is it is early. There are some interesting activity in the Med D space, for example. But beyond that, I don\u2019t see anything unusually large in terms of the number of proposals that at this point have been released. It would be a bit early for a lot of the stuff that we would expect to see to be out. So it\u2019s just starting now.","George Hill - Deutsche Bank","And then Cathy, I guess just, if I look on the income statement, the nonrecurring transaction costs seem to have been persistent and recurring and over the last couple of years have consumed a meaningful amount of cash. I guess, how should we think about that line in the income statement going forward and how it kind of impacts the divergence between earnings and cash flow? And just how long these transaction charges are going to keep showing up?","Cathy Smith","Our intention is to finish our integration activities by the end of the year.

[Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","I would now like to turn the conference over to our host, VP of Investor Relations, Mr. David Myers. Please go ahead, sir.","David Myers","Thank you, operator, and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings call. With me today are George Paz, Chairman and CEO, and Jeff Hall, our CFO.","Before we begin, I need to read the following Safe Harbor statement. Statements or comments made on this conference call may be forward-looking statements and may include financial projections or other statements of the company's plans, objectives, expectations or intentions. These matters involve certain risks and uncertainties. The company's actual results may differ significantly from those projected or suggested in any forward-looking statement due to a variety of factors which are discussed in detail in the company's filings with the SEC.","For clarity purposes, all numbers we talk about today will be on an adjusted basis. Please refer to the tables in our press release for reconciliation of GAAP to the adjusted numbers we will be discussing. The reconciliation of EBITDA to net income can also be found in our earnings release. The earnings release is posted on our website.","At this point. I'll turn the call over to Jeff who will discuss our fourth quarter results and our guidance for 2013.","Jeffrey L. Hall","Thank you, David. Our fourth quarter results concluded a very strong 2012. We finished the year reporting earnings per share of $3.74, up 26% over 2011. The year benefited from strong integration execution, the accelerated realization of synergies and increased generic and home delivery utilization, which helped drive our clients' trends to record loads [ph].","For the fourth quarter, earnings per share were $1.05, up 28% over the same quarter last year. Gross profit margin was 8.6%, up 120 basis points from last year and 50 basis points sequentially as a result of higher generic utilization, supply chain efficiencies and the realization of synergies. SG&A was $785 million, up from $651 million last quarter, reflecting increased IT spending on several corporate initiatives, increased management incentive compensation commensurate with overall performance and the normal seasonal ramp in expenses to prepare for 1\/1. EBITDA was $1.6 billion, up 131% from last year, and EBITDA per adjusted script was $4.01, up 10% from last year.","Cash flow for the quarter was $2.6 billion and for the year, was $4.8 billion. Cash flow was positively impacted by timing and other factors around year-end, which pulled approximately $500 million of cash into 2012.","This strong year positions us well for 2013. We expect to achieve 2013 earnings per share in the range of $4.20 to $4.30, which represents growth of 12% to 15% over 2012. Adjusted claims are expected to increase approximately 5% to 7% over 2012. This increase in claims reflects the additional quarter of claims from Medco, new business wins, utilization of 0% to 1%, and these increases are partially offset by the roll-off of approximately half of the United claims during 2013.","SG&A in the year is expected to decline approximately 8% to 10%, resulting from the realization of additional synergies, lower management incentive compensation and the sale of our Liberty business in December of 2012. Both gross profit and SG&A for Liberty were approximately $135 million in 2012.","These decreases were partially offset by adding an additional quarter of Medco. EBITDA per Rx will increase 15% to 18% over 2012. We expect that noncontrolling interest will be approximately $20 million and depreciation is expected to be $385 million to $400 million.","Interest expense will be reduced by the planned redemption of the $1 billion of 6 1\/4% senior notes in the first half of 2013. Cash flow from operations is expected to be $4.5 billion to $5 billion in the year.","Including estimates for the exercise of options and share repurchases, we expect fully diluted shares outstanding for the year to be between 825 million and 835 million. As in prior years, our focus remains on achieving our guidance for the year and positioning the company for longer-term growth. As a result, we do not guide individual quarters.","We had an outstanding year in 2012, closing the transaction with Medco, making considerable progress with integration, generating 26% earnings growth and setting up for 12% to 15% growth in 2013, while continuing to make investments to prepare for Health Care Reform and to extend our differentiated offering.","At this point, I'll turn the call over to George.","George Paz","Thank you, Jeff, and good morning, everyone. We've closed the books on one of the most successful and transformative years in our company's history. And we're starting a new chapter. We are bullish on the PBM industry and, in particular, our strategic positioning. Making use of prescription drugs safer and more affordable has been our mission for the past 25 years. We've built Express Scripts in a thoughtful, strategic way with acquisitions, helping to build scale and create an industry-leading suite of clinical tools to address the needs of plan sponsors and patients. We've always anticipated changes and challenges in the healthcare marketplace, and found ways to help clients adapt and safely navigate through the environment. This track record of success has benefited clients, patients and stockholders. Many of you have asked for clarity around the future of the PBM industry and our long-term earnings growth outlook. As you know, we do not provide multiyear guidance. However, now that we are nearly 1 year into the integration, I want to take this opportunity to share our thoughts on the future of the PBM industry and Express Scripts in particular.","Since our founding, our commitment to innovation has allowed us to create better healthcare delivery for America. We created world-class tools designed to increase generic utilization, develop superior clinical programs to improve health outcomes, drove lower-cost home delivery and improved the cost and quality of specialty pharmacy. More recently, we have combined our research regarding behavioral sciences and the expertise of specialized pharmacists to further improve health outcomes and lower costs. The feedback from our clients has been overwhelmingly positive regarding our extended product portfolio. Our focus on delivering superior value to our clients, patients and stockholders has never wavered.","As we head towards 2014 and the introduction of insurance exchanges, additional costly regulations, escalation of brand drug prices and specialty drug utilization, our clients face unprecedented challenges to control the pharmacy benefit. Today, we are better positioned than ever to help clients and members navigate the landscape on the eve of Health Care Reform. Approximately 80% of the new lives that will obtain coverage beginning in 2014 are concentrated in 25 states. Our managed care partners have solid market positions in virtually every one of these states.","As a result, we are confident of our positioning in the rapidly changing healthcare environment. Our positive outlook is reinforced by several key drivers impacting the PBM industry overall. These include an aging population, Health Care Reform that will result in new participants in the insured marketplace, the anticipated introduction of new specialty drugs, the continued exploration of patents on branded drugs and the continued increase in the use of more efficient distribution channels such as home delivery and narrow networks.","Although all PBMs will benefit from this industry growth drivers, each individual year has a potential to be influenced by a variety of headwinds and tailwinds such as the economic environment, client retention, new product introduction and the dynamics of the pricing environment. Based on the PBM trends, our strategic positioning, client mix and our differentiated and informative platform, we are excited about our future.","Before I close, I would like to take a second to recognize the tremendous effort of our more than 30,000 employees. Our employees have worked untold hours in combining clinical programs, IT systems, operating platforms and back-office functions to seamlessly provide best-in-class services to our clients and patients. Their dedication and passion is second to none.","At this point, we will be happy to answer any questions. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go to the line of Lisa Gill.","Lisa C. Gill - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","I had just 2 questions. One would be, for near-term, can you give us an idea of what the size of this year's selling season looks like compared to other years? I know that it's a new year with a combined offering, and can you also just give us an idea of what customers are looking for, what the early feedback has been from customers as we think about this? I think investors are focused on this 2014 selling season. And then secondly, you talked about a lot of the positive factors going into the longer-term outlook for the PBM industry. And I know you want to stay away from giving guidance, but can we think about the industry being a double-digit grower given the amount of cash flow that yourself and the rest of the industry will produce over the next several years?","George Paz","Well, yes. Let me talk about the selling season first of all. This is very early on, as you might suspect. But I think this is going to be a different selling season than most. When you look at -- we're on the verge of 2014, which is the introduction of the exchanges. Many states have opted in. Some states have opted out. There's just a tremendous amount of uncertainty surrounding how this is all going to roll out. For companies that are large in nature, spanning many, many states, there's a lot of process that has to go on here. And since the exchanges don't even exist for the most part today, people don't want to take their employees, which is their most important asset, and just throw them at something that's unproven at this point. So I think this coming year is going to be probably not a big impact from employers. There's a lot of rumors out there about employers dropping coverage and moving on. Clearly, some employers that are in deep financial stress that have no other choice to survive, will make decisions such as that. But I think there's going to be a lot of wait and let's see. Let's figure out what happens. At the end of day, again, your workforce is your most important asset. And if those -- if your people aren't happy and they're not getting the coverage they need, and people are spending all their time on the phone trying to navigate whatever the world's going to look like at that point, that's going to be tough. And I don't know what that does to productivity and other items, but it can't be good. So I don't think you're going to see this rush of people dropping. Nothing we see shows that evidence or shows those numbers. At the same time, managed-care companies I think are going to be probably not as quick to change PBMs this year as they do in the past. It's not to say if you don't have a bad service issue or you don't have an account manager that leaves and they were the person that was closest to the client and therefore you have some disruption, that there won't be some changes. But I think it's going to be a little different. As companies -- the managed-care industry really has to brace itself -- how often does an industry get the chance to welcome so many new participants into the field? And changing over a lot of your processes while you're trying to win share is often not an easy task. So I think this is going to be a bit of a stable year in that regard, managed-care company turnover. I do think that Express Scripts is ideally positioned though, with what we do, our ability to reach out to individual patients, our behavioral science coupled with the specialized pharmacists we were fortunate enough to gain from the Medco acquisition. It has really positioned us well to be a leader in this space. And as I said in my prepared comments, when you look at the distribution of uninsured coming to the market, we feel great about our representation. Our job now is to help our clients position themselves well for that -- for the market that's about to unfold. When you think about guidance beyond 2013, we don't give numbers. Think about where we're at today. Our clinical pharmacists are out talking with our clients on a daily basis, looking at their needs and their demands on -- that they have, and trying to sell them new products that will help them drive down their costs. When they save money, we make money, which is a great combination. Our people are focused on that. So between our account managers, our clinical pharmacists, we are constantly in front of our clients and we're selling to them. We're selling them options to help them improve their health outcomes, while driving down those costs and improving our shareholder value proposition. That goes on throughout the year. In addition to that, when we look at the renewal season, new client wins don't have much of an impact on first year. So if we sell something in 2014, although I know a lot of people like to make banner news out of these things, if it's a large enough client to warrant discussion, the profitability of those clients usually aren't that great. And it may make for big headline news, but at the end of the day it has very little impact, if any, on earnings. But the other side to that is retaining clients where you have relationships and you've got all of your infrastructure already established and it's an ongoing annuity stream where you're helping that client continue to save money while you -- while we make money for our shareholders, that's a very important part of our business and we don't have great clarity around that today. Although I do think it's going to be a lighter-than-normal season, there's still roughly 25% of the book, although again, I think this will be a bit lighter this year, is up for renewals. So we have to work our way through that process but we just don't like to go out on that limb and talk about the future. I think if you look at us historically, every year we've grown in excess of double-digits, so we feel great about this industry but we're not going to comment on 2014 or out years.","Operator","We will now go to the line of Glen Santangelo with Credit Suisse.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","George, I was just wondering if I could get some of your updated thoughts on the competitive landscape. You're facing a bunch of different competitors that all have sort of different financial motivations and metrics that may be driving their respective decision-making processes. And so I'm kind of curious as to are you seeing any change in that competitive landscape as a result of that or is it kind of more business as usual?","George Paz","Well, again, I was asked that question in 1998, and the marketplace was incredibly competitive and I don't think it's changed one bit since. Everybody is constantly trying to figure out new ways to gain clients and retain clients. And I think the best way you do that is having top-of-notch, best in -- world-class service offerings and at the same time, bringing them clinical programs, which drive down costs. If you're forced to compete because you don't have a broad spectrum of products and offerings, and all you have to compete on is price, then you're at a tremendous disadvantage because you can drop your prices low enough that somebody may choose your services, but the other side of that equation is at the end of the day, it doesn't matter. Nobody cares about our profit or my competitors' profits. What they care about is their overall drug cost. The amount that the head of HR has to bring to the CFO during the budget process is the most important aspect of their job. And so to the extent that I can take out 3%, 5%, 6%, 8%, 10% out of their drug cost, in any given year, I have a variety of ways to do it. I can do it through clinical programs, I can do it through benefit offerings or I can do it through pure price changes. And just to be totally frank, if I'm doing it through price changes, then we don't need marketing departments and we don't need product departments, and that's not where we put our time. We put our time behind those things that are going to make our clients happy. By the way, when all you do is compete on price, that's a vicious cycle that you're in because you're not bringing the client anything new but further reductions in price, which ultimately erodes shareholder value. We would rather take our money, invest it in clinical programs and new products that allow us to sell items to our clients, which allow us to drive down their costs to even lower rates than pure discounts, increase shareholder value. That's been our focus since our inception and we'll continue to focus on that.","Glen J. Santangelo - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Maybe if I can just ask one follow up to Jeff. Jeff, can you give us a sense for what level of capital deployment may be embedded within the guidance? And I think if I go back to what you said last year, ultimately, that the deal you had worked out with the rating agencies was to get that leverage back to 1 to 2x, is that still the case? Are you anticipating on getting there by the end of this year? And how should we think about the timing of more accelerated capital deployment?","Jeffrey L. Hall","We're real happy with how our capital structure has played out. We were able to accelerate some cash flow into '12. We ended with a nice strong cash balance in '12. We guided to $4.5 billion to $5 billion of cash from ops this year, which is great. So we're certainly ahead of our plans on cash flow. We announced that we are repaying -- or repurchasing $1 billion of bonds. We were ahead of schedule last year. We're moving forward with more repurchases this year. We're not being specific about how much we plan to repurchase. It's difficult to do. You have to estimate prices and everything else. But we're certainly ahead of schedule with where we want to be. We're excited about our execution here and think that we'll be in the market buying back stock midyear, plus or minus.","Operator","We will now go to the line of Tom Gallucci with Lazard.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Two questions. Maybe, first for Jeff, just wondering if you could tell us where you sort of are in that ramp of synergies? I'm assuming you're still sort of comfortable with that $1 billion. Any color on where you've been and sort of what do you expect this year or into '14? Maybe some of the major activities that are behind us and are still in process?","George Paz","Before I give it -- turn it over to Jeff, Tom, let me just address the $1 billion. When we go do due diligence, we can see the differentials in pricing between the 2 companies. And by that, I mean discounts at given retailers and rebate levels and operational efficiencies across sites and cost to -- back-office costs and what have you decided what things can be eliminated. And we put our best guess at that number. Once we close, we don't really spend a whole lot of time and effort because we don't really think it provides much value in trying to determine how much of the value that's being created out of our growth is coming out of synergies versus just business as usual. And when you think about it, our supply-chain people are constantly out there consulting with big pharma and trying to get better discounts. At the same time, our account management team is trying to narrow both networks and narrow formulary offerings, and so they work together. So once you get past point zero and you combine offerings, you get a kick as you bring them in and get the best of both worlds. But you also get kicks because we are bigger now and have more leverage. In addition to that, we get value because we are pretty effective at narrowing networks and driving tighter formularies and eliminating inefficiencies. And so, we give those numbers but I think as we said on the first quarter call after the close, going beyond that, we really can't provide updates any longer on synergies just that you see the growth coming out of the overall business. And if you reflect back on 2012, we had an incredible year. I think our original guidance came out at $3.51, and we ended up at $3.74. We were able to gain a lot of value in that first year, and so I think we are very far ahead. Our cash flow execution has been very strong and this really positions us well for capital deployment. So I feel that we've positioned ourselves well. I don't know, Jeff, if you want to...","Jeffrey L. Hall","I think that's exactly right. I mean we've, obviously had a great year in '12 on synergy execution. I think the team here has done a great job across, basically, everything we've put them out there to accomplish. We're achieving the integration goals on a timely basis. As you can see from the 26% growth last year, 12% to 15% growth into '13 with 15% to 18% EBITDA per Rx growth. Obviously, the team is doing a nice job getting expenses down, getting efficiencies and we think we're executing well and expect to continue to execute and keep driving earnings through 2013.","Thomas Gallucci - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Just as a follow-up, George on sort of your longer-term commentary. I was wondering about 2 areas. What are your expectations over the longer-term for the growth of home delivery? And then the other area is just sort of medical management. Do you think it's important? And if it is, do you think there's a big opportunity there for you to increasingly, as a PBM, impact the medical benefit over and above the drug benefit where you've been historically?","George Paz","Great questions. I would tell you when you think about the overall of medical benefit, there's an awful lot of inefficiencies that exist. On our commercial book of business, we have some different programs that we use where we actually consult with the rest of the advisers. We kind of know our position in the equation. So we're not trying to circumvent what our clients are actually doing, or duplicate, which is the worst of anything in the healthcare industry where you have ever-increasing cost. So what we try to do is complement what our clients do, but at the same time, try to get the best out of it. I think when you look at medical -- managed-care industry, they're often looking for gaps in care and whether or not people are getting their tests and their checkups and doing the things they should be doing based upon their disease state and age and what have you. When you think about the drug side, there's an awful lot that goes into that as well as far as follow-up lab work and make sure the medications are working properly, people are taking their medications and working through. I think that when you look at the industry overall, there's still so much inefficiency and so much that's not being done. I think there's enough we can grow on by staying focused on what we do, at least for the shorter-term. As we look out to the future, I do believe that the sky's the limit, quite frankly. I think that there is a tremendous opportunity for us to continue to look for opportunities to see where we can add our tools, our expertise and help either our -- help our clients or expand into ancillary areas that can help our clients. So we're excited about the healthcare industry. Any other?","Jeffrey L. Hall","I would add to that, I guess, just as background facts. We have seen -- there's obviously some noise with clients moving out in integration here, but we do see home delivery kind of on the same basis, up about 3% year-to-date. So we're happy with that. And despite all the noise on home delivery and other things out there in the market, we strongly believe that home delivery is the best option. The peer-reviewed studies that we point to here clearly show that people that get their prescriptions in home delivery have higher adherence, lower overall cost, better outcomes kind of across-the-board. So it continues to be our goal to continue to drive that where it make sense.","George Paz","Just to follow-up on that point, the other piece is when it's -- today our environment, the employer pays 70% to 80% of the cost of healthcare. So it's not really the patients' dollars. What we do see is areas like Medicare, Medicaid -- well, especially Medicare, where you're paying a higher portion. There's a lot of generic utilization in those areas. And I believe when it's your dollars, you're going to be taking a lot more care of how you spend those dollars. I think when we move into healthcare exchanges and you've got individuals buying policies and they can take their policies so far to get better benefits by managing their expenses smartly, I think you're going to see more use of lower-cost channels and more uses of lower-cost drugs because it's going to benefit them directly. So I do believe this is very promising for us into the future.","Operator","We will now go to the line of Robert Jones with Goldman Sachs.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Just wanted to follow up on a couple of the components of guidance, specifically in relation to the last call. It looks you guys are saying 5% to 7% Rx growth. I was just wondering what you're assuming on the core utilization behind that? I know George, last time, you were thinking about scripts as kind of flat to slightly down year-over-year. And then just along those same lines, as far as the components of guidance, looks like EBITDA per script, 15%, 18%, a little bit better than the mid-teens outlook you guys shared with us last time. Sounds like maybe a little bit improvement on the cost side. But just broadly wondering what got you a little bit more incrementally positive there as well?","George Paz","Well, as we said back on the last quarterly call, there was a lot of uncertainty we were facing, and we were hearing a lot of negativism from our clients. And, in fact, many of our managed care clients have seen declines in membership -- we wanted to wait until we got into January so we could see the eligibility files and understand exactly what this impact was going to be. We have -- we have assumed in our book of business that the weak economic situation we're facing continues. Historically, as you know, we used to budget at 3% utilization trends and we usually come in at 5%, which causes us to increase earnings over the course of any given year. We haven't seen that since 2007. And the numbers have been running down in the low single-digits to actually negative in some given quarters. We plan, going out into the future, at between 0% and 1%, again as we do it by client, we don't do it in aggregate. But the overall impact of that is 0% to 1% utilization, which we think is about where the market is. We'll see how things unfold over the course of the quarter. The other side, when you talk about EBITDA per script, that conversation we're having earlier about -- there's a lot of things that go into that, but one of the things, of course, is synergy acquisition. As we gain our synergies, that drives up EBITDA, which gives us increases in EBITDA per script. So that's clearly a focus. Operating improvements also continues to drive it. And of course, product design works in that favor. Keep in mind that we've been fortunate now. We've taken all the Medco expertise we've acquired and coupled it with the Express Scripts expertise. And so those clients that were Medco clients are getting the benefit of what we were doing at Express Scripts and vice versa for the Medco clients -- and Express Scripts clients. And they're all getting new opportunities to have new products and share in value, and those things equate to better savings for the client and higher EBITDA for us.","Robert P. Jones - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It actually leads into my follow-up just around retention. If you're willing to share a little bit on the Medco legacy clients. As we think about last year's selling season and as you think about this year's selling season, did you see or are you expecting to see a disproportional amount of these customers going through the RFP process relative to your own legacy sponsors? And I guess just if so, should we be thinking about more RFPs as a percent of your total book relative to the kind of the pre-Medco years?","George Paz","No. I think it's the other way around. The problem we had, which any acquisition faces, is that we were tied up to the FTC for 1 year. We announced the deal, and then we had to wait almost 1 year to close. And there's a lot of uncertainty. Keep in mind, as we talked earlier, roughly 25% of your book, for any given client -- some companies it's higher, some are lower I guess -- but it comes up for renewal in a year. And there's an awful lot of uncertainty, both from personnel. Our business is no different than any other business. The account management team, the people that are facing that client everyday are our tentacles out to that client and that's our touch points. And if those people leave, if we give bad service, if there's not great relationships, that can cause us to lose a client. If they've got great relationships and they're -- and when we do hit a little bit of a service issue, they can quickly help recover from that. Those people are very important to us. And so when you think about all the uncertainty around an acquisition, so we announce something, we can't really do much because we are barred by the FTC. And so the employees have a tremendous amount of uncertainty overhanging them, thinking about where their future is going to be and what's going to happen to them, and if they have children in school and on and on and on. And that just -- that hurts. In any business, it hurts. And that's what you see -- saw come through last year's results. But having said all that, keep in mind, we usually set our retention targets at 95%. We're at 94%. I think that's a pretty damn good year, just in my opinion. We worked very hard at that. We brought clients new product. But there's still that period of uncertainty, and I think we got beyond that. And I think we feel very good about where we sit and the tools we brought forward. And we feel good that going into 2013, we have the right tools, the right people. We've settled on what our management team looks like. We've assigned our client managers to our clients. We are in a much better position today than we were 1 year ago today. So I like where we're at.","Operator","We will now go to the line of Robert Willoughby with Bank of America.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","George or Jeff, we had the United business rolling off ratably over the next 5 quarters absent any other assumption, but you indicated you do expect to keep 50% of it in '13, did I hear that correct? And is that a new assumption for your or was this generally your expectation all along for that book of business?","Jeffrey L. Hall","No, nothing's changed. Basically, our expectation is that by the end of this year, all of the scripts will be gone. But when you think about what that means from a financial standpoint is that we had 100% of the net claims in '12, we're going to have half of them in '13 and 0 then in '14. So it looks like it rolls of half and half.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. And you were calling the $1 billion in notes due 2014, there's another $303 million in notes that come due this year. Would you seek to wipe out the term loan as well this year? Or is that where we'll get some balance between share repurchase and further reductions in the term loan?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Look, I can't talk about things that we haven't announced at this point. But your premise is right. We are bringing in the $1 billion of 6 1\/4% notes. We do have $300 million of other maturities this year. And as we move through the rest of the year, it will be the same as we've said previously. We'll pay down the bank loan when that makes sense and if other of our bonds become net present value positive to redeem, we'll go look at those options, too.","George Paz","And we'll pay it -- we'll lay it out again, share repurchase, to make sure we maximize or optimize, in our opinion, our capital structure.","Jeffrey L. Hall","Absolutely.","Robert M. Willoughby - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just a -- do you have a CapEx forecast for this year? And then maybe for George, have you had any interaction as yet with the new WellPoint CEO?","Jeffrey L. Hall","Well, I mean nothing's really changed with CapEx. This is not a capital-intensive business and the CapEx we have forecasted doesn't meaningfully move the needle. Not really relevant for guidance.","George Paz","As far as the new CEO, I have not spoke with him yet. I look forward to that opportunity, and starting a new page in our book with WellPoint. Should be exciting.","Operator","We will now go to the line of John Kreger with the William Blair.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","George or Jeff, could you give us an update on where you stand with the Medco integration process, perhaps where you are in the systems crossover, where you are with divestitures and any other key updates? Curious as you watch your kind of service metrics, how those have trended during the systems crossover?","George Paz","I'll start, if you want, and you chime in, Jeff. We are -- so if you think about the way a system process has to work, you have to build the benefits on the new system we're going to. There's a lot of things that the Express Scripts system did and does that the Medco system didn't do. And since we're moving to the Medco system, all that has to be built out. Moving the very first live, which, of course, was the Express Scripts lives, they're our guinea pigs, if you will, we had to build a tremendous amount of the architecture around the system and the different programs that we needed to make it work. So the upfront piece is very intense. We also have some very complex clients that build off of those different attributes that we have in the system. And so as we build out, that's a process we're on. So although we've moved, as a percentage basis, a smaller percentage of the total lives, we've built out a tremendous amount of the requirements of the destination system to handle the Express Scripts lives. Now every month, as we proceed, we are moving more and more of the lives into the system. We monitor very closely. 1\/1 is quite a day here. We set up what we call a war room. We have everybody from operations to systems people to the account managers and there's thousands of people that participate in our daily calls and monitor service levels and what's going on in any given 1\/1. What we've done is we replicated that so that every month, when a new wave of lives move, we put those same processes in place. Our goal is that if, just to be totally frank, you're always going to have a little bit of a hiccup. Anytime you do something, something is different. So when those hiccups occur, the idea is could we find them and correct them before the client notices them. And that's our mission. That's what we try to accomplish. And I think we're doing a very good job when you think about the complexity and size of this integration. And, quite frankly, how quickly we're able to do them. So I feel good about it. We're along our path. The systems integration side will be done by -- our target is the end of this year. And I think we're on path to accomplish that.","John Kreger - William Blair & Company L.L.C., Research Division","Great. One quick follow-up for Jeff. In the guidance, I think you talked about 5% to 7% for overall claims growth in '13. What do you think about home delivery? Would you expect that to be faster or slower than the 5% to 7%?","Jeffrey L. Hall","We haven't broken out the guidance in that level of detail. I mean, obviously, we're trying to grow home delivery as fast as we can. Because as I said earlier, we can just absolutely prove that it is better for clients and better for members and it improves health outcomes, and keeping with our model of alignment is better for us. We've got some great new programs. We've got a great team of people executing on it, so we're optimistic here. But as you've seen before, it's affected by other things outside of our control. So certainly, we're targeting to keep growing it but not breaking out kind of individual estimates. Just to close off on your previous question, too, I'm also happy with the progress we are making on divestitures. Obviously, if you have a chance to read our K, you'll see that Liberty and some of the other smaller subsidiaries have been effectively sold at this point, and others are in-flight. So we're happy with the progress we're making there as well.","Operator","Hello, Mr. Hill, your line is open.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Jeff, I guess just a quick accounting question or a bookkeeping question. Is there any chance you would quantify for us the fixed cost that remain as part of serving the United business and the fixed cost with respect to technology with the 2 platforms that we should look forward as falling off as the year goes on?","Jeffrey L. Hall","No, is the simple answer. Look, we just don't think it's meaningful to building models to get tied up in small little details and we certainly don't like to comment about individual clients. I think, we did give more lines of guidance this year than we normally do, we think. The thing to focus on is 15% to 18% EBITDA per Rx growth, the 5% to 7% script growth, and all that pulling through to a 12% to 15% EPS growth. And the small little things just kind of get you into places you don't need to be.","George Hill - Citigroup Inc, Research Division","Okay. And maybe then a quick follow-up. George, you had highlighted that on the third quarter call, a lot of your customers felt very cautious. Maybe with respect to how your customers feel looking into '13? From what you've heard from the sales force and the account executives, do the customers generally feel better looking forward with more certainty postelection, post-budget resolution? Just from your perspective, what's the sense of how the client base feels such that it gives you guys some more comfort now?","George Paz","Well, I still think that the economy is still a drag on all of corporate America. There's just a tremendous amount of uncertainty. We see spikes. Certain -- I think housing starts are starting to pick up some, which is a very good sign. Sale of existing homes has picked up some. Unemployment kind of surprises us both good and bad at times. So I think there's an awful lot of -- the economy feels like it wants to get going but there's also still a tremendous amount of uncertainty out there. And quite frankly, we're still facing a sequestration at some point if our elected officials don't do something. So I do really believe that all those things play -- put a sense of uncertainty around an economy. That's hard to plan for as a CEO. You want to deploy capital, you want to build. But you also don't want to have idle capacity or idle capital sitting out there. So these aren't easy times for business. We need some certainty around overall tax rates and what we're going to do with foreign dollars overseas and there's just so many questions that overhang the economy today. We really need some certainty around this stuff. So I do think that, that's going to still play heavily throughout '13 until we finally -- unless Congress can get their act together and get some certainty around it. So I'm hopeful that will happen at some point.","Operator","We will now go to the line of Ricky Goldwasser with Morgan Stanley.","Ricky Goldwasser - Morgan Stanley, Research Division","Just focusing on potential future opportunities around Part D and the Medicaid expansion, it seems like the data from CMS just came out earlier in the week showed some very nice growth in your PDP plan. So George, can you give us some color about how you think about part D and Medicaid expansion as growth drivers for your business in the out years?","George Paz","Yes, Medicaid expansion is, I think, is a real opportunity for us. When you think about many of our managed care plans, without getting into names, have openly stated that they're very interested in expanding their Medicaid opportunities. It's a logical extension for a lot of these companies. Our job is to make sure, as you know, there, it's all about cost efficiencies. And so it's very important that they have the right formularies, the right tools, the ability to try to impact those patients' lives. So again, our account teams work very closely with our managed care clients in order to make sure that we are well-positioned to gain our share of that as well. I think there's -- between that and the exchanges, I think there's some very strong opportunities for us in the future.","Well, thank you all. Thank you, everyone, for participating in the call this morning. We look forward to talking with you again in just a couple of months while -- after we release our first quarter results and we'll catch up with you then. Thank you. Bye-bye.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. Thank you for your participation and using the AT&T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect."]}}
