The passcode of 5937050 will be required.","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ken Lockwood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Lockwood.","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thanks very much, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Fluor's Third Quarter 2014 Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after the market closed, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our safe harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which we have summarized on Slide 2.","During today's call and slide presentation we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today.","Also, during this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","So with that, I will turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I'm pleased to report that we had a very good quarter, including strong earnings, significant new awards and growth in backlog. On today's call, we'll review these results, our guidance for the balance of '14 as well as talk about our initial guidance for 2015.","If you'll turn to Slide 3, I want to begin by covering some of the highlights from the third quarter. Net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were $183 million or $1.15 per diluted share, which compares with $173 million or $1.05 per diluted share a year ago.","Our consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $335 million, which was an 8% increase from $311 million a year ago. The growth in segment profit results was primarily driven by a 65% increase in Oil & Gas, reflecting very strong performance. As expected, Oil & Gas margins declined slightly from last quarter as project execution on existing projects increased, but we're still at a very strong 5.5%.","Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $5.4 billion, which is down from $6.7 billion a year ago, but again mainly due to significantly lower revenues in Mining & Metals business. Oil & Gas revenues increased 15% over last quarter as existing projects and backlog transitioned from a detailed engineering phase into the field and construction, as construction gets underway.","New awards for the quarter were strong at $6 billion, including $4.5 billion in Oil & Gas, $700 million in Government, $460 million in Industrial & Infrastructure and $382 million in Power.","Consolidated backlog at the quarter end rose to $42.3 billion, which is up 16% from $36.5 billion a year ago.","Our financial results are summarized on Table 4, and I'll continue my remarks on Slide 5. During the quarter, the Oil & Gas segment booked new awards of $4.5 million, as I -- billion, as I said previously, which includes a refinery project in Malaysia for Petronas and the Fort Hills oil sands project in Canada. The Oil & Gas segment also continues to book a number of small- to medium-sized projects, which indicates our clients are still moving forward with FEED and detailed engineering projects.","Ending backlog for Oil & Gas segment was a record $26.5 billion, which is up 41% from a year ago.","We continue to track a robust list of sizable projects in the United States, Mexico, the Middle East and Asia and expect a number of major FEED programs to convert to EPC as we move to 2015.","Finally, our success in the U.S. petrochemical market continues with the award of Sasol Chemicals Complex in Louisiana, which we announced earlier this week. Fluor, with our partner Technip, will execute all aspects of this world-class ethane cracker and derivatives complex. We will take this project into backlog in the fourth quarter.","Turning to Slide 6. New awards for Industrial & Infrastructure were modest at $460 million and included a number of small mining and industrial services awards.","Backlog at the end of the quarter was $8.7 billion, down from $13 billion a year ago. This decline continues to be driven by a lack of significant awards and moving into EPC for the Mining & Metals business line.","Mining & Metals business market, however, is showing some very early signs of returning with FEED and study work picking up. We could see some small- to mid-sized awards in the near term, with potential for a few major prospects by the end of next year. We continue to pursue a number of prospects in Infrastructure. However, a highly competitive marketplace remains unchanged.","We expect to book the A9 public-private partnership-financed highway project in the Netherlands in the fourth quarter and have several opportunities in the United States as we are pursuing in 2015.","Now if you turn to Slide 7. It shows the Government group posted new awards of $700 million, which includes approximately $400 million for the Department of Energy's Paducah Gaseous Diffusion plant in Kentucky. This is a great project that allows us to deploy our decade-long nuclear remediation expertise and adds another long-term contract to our DOE portfolio. Ending backlog for Government stood at $5.2 billion, similar to last quarter.","With regard to LOGCAP IV, we expect task order volumes to moderate downward as a number of the sites and personnel that we have served are reduced. For 2015, we anticipate full year revenue of approximately $800 million, down from just about $1 billion in 2014. The release of task order awards will obviously depend on the U.S. strategy in Afghanistan on an ongoing basis.","The Power segment new awards were $382 million, as I said, including engineering and construction for new gas-fired power plant in South Carolina. Ending backlog was $1.8 billion compared to 2.8 -- $2.1 billion a year ago. We continue to bid for new gas-fired opportunities in North America and expect opportunities for power generation and plant betterment to improve in 2015.","With that, I'd like to now turn it to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 of the presentation. I'll start by providing a few comments on our third quarter performance then move to the balance sheet. As expected, overall revenue for the quarter was down fairly significantly year-over-year, mainly due to the continued falloff in mining activity.","Oil & Gas revenue improved 12% compared to last year and increased 15% over last quarter. While we continue to execute a substantial amount of higher margin FEED activity in Oil & Gas, large projects are starting to move into the field, which will generate higher revenue and cause the margin on a percent basis to moderate.","Industrial & Infrastructure revenue continued to contract. This contraction, along with successful project closeouts in Mining & Metals and favorable project execution performance from infrastructure, contributed a strong margin in the -- margins in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 9. Corporate G&A expenses for the third quarter were $35 million, down from $46 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly due -- or mainly the result of lower stock price-driven compensation costs.","The effective tax rate in the third quarter was approximately 33%, an increase from the 29% tax rate a year ago. The lower 2013 rate was due to U.S. federal tax research credits, which were not extended beyond 2013. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of 2014 to be between 32% and 33%.","Please turn to Slide 10. Before I move to the balance sheet, I want to provide an update on discontinued operations with regard to the Doe Run lead business, which the company sold in 1994. In October, we entered into a settlement agreement with counsel for a number of plaintiffs who had filed lawsuits against the company. As a result, in the third quarter, we recorded an additional after-tax charge of discontinued operations. This settlement is expected to result in cash outflows upon the receipt of releases from the plaintiffs. We do not expect any material charges to result from our main lawsuits relating to the Doe Run lead business.","Finally, Fluor's Board of Directors approved the termination of the U.S.-defined benefit pension plan effective December 31, 2014. The settlement of the plan, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to be complete in 2015. The company expects to recognize additional expenses when the plan is settled, including unrecognized actuarial losses of approximately $160 million included in accumulated other comprehensive loss plus additional amounts where the settlement obligation exceeds the current pension liability. We do not expect the settlement to have a material impact on cash position. Settling this plan will result in lower future expenses and eliminate the risk of rising Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp premiums.","Shifting to the balance sheet on Slide 11. Cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2.4 billion, down from $2.7 billion last quarter. This quarterly decline was primarily due to increased working capital balances at quarter end.","In addition, the company repurchased approximately $100 million worth of shares and paid $33 million in dividends.","As of September 30 for the year, we have returned approximately $504 million to cash -- in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. While substantial already, we intend to pick up the pace of share repurchases from the third quarter level.","Moving to Slide 12. As previously mentioned, Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $42.3 billion. The percentage of fixed-price contracts in our overall backlog declined to 18%, and the mix by geography was 28% U.S. and 72% non-U.S.","I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2014 and 2015, which is on Slide 13. In line with my comments in early September, we are narrowing our 2014 guidance from continuing operations to a range of $4.10 to $4.30 per diluted share from the previous range of $4.10 to $4.45 per diluted share.","For 2015, we're establishing our initial EPS guidance at a range of $4.50 to $5 per diluted share. Our range for 2015 reflects a rising backlog and solid growth opportunities in Oil & Gas and a stable to moderate improvement in the company's other end markets. This range excludes any pension settlement-related charges because they are not fully estimable at this time.","For 2015, we anticipate growing revenue contributions from all business groups and expect earnings to grow over the course of the year. Guidance for 2015 assumes a G&A expense will be in the range of $190 million to $200 million and an effective tax rate of 33% to 35%.","For 2015, we expect CapEx to run roughly in line with the pace this year at around $300 million.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess a couple of questions. First, David, I know you don't like questions on guidance within guidance, but I'll ask it anyway because last year, you sort of set yourself up for it. When you guided last year, you said earnings should be sort of back-end-weighted versus first half. And as I look at the guidance today, I'm just trying to get a feel for how you're thinking about guidance. Should we expect earnings growth each quarter? Is it more back-end loaded? And then the second question to that would be, over the past couple of years when you've guided, you've tended to hit the low end of your range versus the historic Fluor, which has tended to sort of be in raise [ph], and I feel like your margins are finally coming through. Your revenue is trying to -- finally, growth is starting to come through on the Oil & Gas side, which makes me hopeful the low end of your range is probably fairly conservative. And then my last question is on I&I. The margins in -- throughout the year have been fairly impressive, and I know there were some -- in the third quarter, you had some closeouts and you had favorable mix, but I'm just trying to think about sustainable margins in I&I on a go-forward basis. Is the 6% range the way to think about it with Mining now a smaller percent of the total?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Jamie. You're right, I don't like giving guidance within the guidance. I could give you a smart answer and say that I'm hoping that our SG&A is significantly higher in the following quarters because our stock price is much higher and the related executive compensation follows. But I think in terms of where we are, I'd go back to what I told you guys the last couple of quarters. We're in the early stages of, I think, a very long, very large cycle in Oil & Gas. I do believe that Mining and Infrastructure are poised to return as we get through next year. So I guess I'm not going to say it's back-end loaded, but I think that it's going to be fairly normal throughout the year. I'll ask Biggs to kind of give a little bit of color on that, particularly around I&I.","Biggs C. Porter","Yes. So as David said, it's normal, but in a growth period, normal would mean that it's going to go up as we go through the year. So I don't think that should surprise anybody that it will be a progression. The guidance is a guidance. I don't think it makes sense to be more qualitative about it, kind of a question in the middle there. But with respect to the I&I margin, it definitely was high for the quarter. Somewhat a numerator and denominator concern or phenomenon because revenues have gone down with Mining. But we had good performance on Mining projects as they close out, and we had very good performance on Infrastructure projects. So clearly a high-level income relative to revenue led to the higher margins. I think that going forward, it obviously is early going into the year. But I think probably, we should expect more the 4% to 5% kind of levels as opposed to 6%. But with good performance, certainly, there's an opportunity to do better than that.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess just last question, and I promise I'll get back in queue, David. When I think about your bookings within Oil & Gas, they've been fairly impressive, considering you've been booking work cost-plus, relative to some of your peers, who were booking work fixed price. So how do I think about the profitability of the stuff you're putting in backlog, given that you're still booking it cost-plus and the market is still fairly competitive? I mean, is it customers are wanting the higher-end contract? Or is it what you've alluded to before, Fluor has a better mousetrap today relative to where you were before so your margins are better? Just some color there and then I'll get back in queue.","David T. Seaton","I think you answered my question -- your own question.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","See how smart I am?","David T. Seaton","I'm telling you, it's amazing. I think I'd stick with what I've said. We continue to improve the quality of margin and backlog. I can't speak to what our competition's doing, but I can speak to the fact that we're winning a fair amount of work and the quality is improving. So you can figure out what that means. We will end up booking some fixed-price projects as we get into next year that will be sizable. And I feel very confident about the execution approach to deliver the profitability at the end of the day. And again, I think it will be improving margin and backlog.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, so going -- looking at the Oil & Gas market, I mean, obviously, you watch the same stuff we do. Maybe you can step back and talk about your confidence level in today's Oil & Gas market, in the sense that do you still feel very confident that you can maintain or grow Oil & Gas backlog over the next year or so? And what do your customers say, especially some of the guys who are maybe in the higher cost areas, about places like the oil sands and stuff when we see this kind of volatility?","David T. Seaton","That's a great question, Andy. The -- I think that we will continue to book in the face of what we see. But just from a perspective standpoint, if you look back 3, 4 years ago, we were at $80 oil then. And if you compare then with now and CapEx spend with those major Oil & Gas customers then and now, it's pretty consistent. Now some of the marginal players -- maybe some of the non-integrateds might have a little bit more issues than the integrateds, but I think they'll trim in some areas. But the things that we're focused on, they need to maintain either reserve replacement or to maintain market share. And any kind of fuel or derivative chemical product is there. Low oil prices and low gas prices obviously makes people like Sasol happy. So I think that continues as well. We have not seen our customers run to the doors, so to speak, relative to their capital plans. I think it's business as usual, with maybe a little more scrutiny on some of the marginal projects that are out there. But the things that we're chasing, I feel -- I have great confidence in them continuing to go and those that are in front of us to reach FID. I feel pretty good about where we stand. But from a perspective standpoint, I don't think it dropping from $100 a barrel to $80-something a barrel markedly changes our customers' spending behaviors, particularly now when they're focused more on capital efficiency. And we're lined up for that. So I think even in a tighter market, I think it puts us in a better position, actually.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And to be clear though, David, even at $26 billion and change of backlog in Oil & Gas, do you still feel like it can grow over the next year, even with burn rates increasing?","David T. Seaton","Yes.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's good. So David, this might be for Biggs, but if you can chime in, that's great, too. When we look at your new '15 guidance, I mean, you have a few businesses that need to turn from what they've been doing over the last couple of years, especially I&I when we look at revenue. And I keep thinking it might stabilize in terms of revenue, but you look at the backlog and it's still down, obviously, very significantly. So what should give us conviction in the statement that Biggs made that revenue should rise in all of the segments? I'd say I'd single out I&I and Government as 2 segments that I worry about a little bit.","David T. Seaton","Well, talk about those 2 specifically, I mean, from a revenue backlog standpoint, I&I is really driven by Mining. And we are beginning the early stages of the next wave. There's some big programs that maybe took a little bit of hiatus that are being dusted off. But again, I think it's sometime mid-next year before we start to see any action there. On Government, honestly, filling up what we earned and burned on LOGCAP is going to be a hard road. So I don't see Government's backlog necessarily increasing over the near term. But I think with Oil & Gas, the start back of mining a few other things that we're doing. Power is a great story with some of the wins that they've got. Even though this quarter, it appears that their backlog is marginally down over last quarter, we still see growth there as well. So just kind of some color. So I don\u2019t know, Biggs, if you'd like to follow on that.","Biggs C. Porter","Well, I think you got it all right. One thing I'd add on, on Government, if you look at margins, their margins are pretty low in the first half of this year, improved in the third quarter on project performance. And we would expect the first half of next year certainly to be at a better margin performance level than the first half of this year. So that alone gives you some lift on Government. I think David's right on everything else that he said. I think, that we -- consistently with what I said in early September, that through the second half of this year, we saw those businesses forming fairly flat, but then we'd be able to improve from there. So I think that's what we're looking for.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So Biggs, is it fair to say that I&I revenue could stabilize at current levels from 3Q?","Biggs C. Porter","I don't want to get too specific. I think I just want to say there is opportunity for them to continue to improve, certainly, on the bottom line. On revenue, I'd look for possibly a dip initially as we continue to transition out of some of the old for mining work but then maybe go up from there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Connors with Stifel.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Fluor's done a pretty good job, and you guys have done a pretty good job in the U.S., pretty much splitting the U.S. cracker market. You guys won 3. So just wondering, going forward in the U.S., what else you guys are possibly looking at? Is there more downstream petrochemical work as well as to get a flavor of what type of projects and -- are out there on the Oil & Gas side, internationally speaking? I know you gave us a geographic breakdown but just trying to get a flavor of particularly what end markets.","David T. Seaton","Well, in the U.S., it's pretty broad. And I wouldn't -- I would also add Power to the U.S. story as well as Infrastructure to the story in the out-years. Clearly, I remember sitting in this call 4, 5, 6 years ago and saying that maybe 1, maybe 2 crackers will be built in the United States, and now there's 2 or 3 more that are -- that really have merit that we're pursuing right now. So I think there's still more to come there. I think there's a significant amount of refining work coming. We feel good about a couple of projects that we're already working on, on the front-end, some of the front-end pre-FID things that look very, very positive. So I think the U.S. has still got a lot of headroom over the next couple of years, clearly, from a new award perspective and then, obviously, for the next 2 to 3 from an earnings perspective. So I'm a little bit bullish on the United States. I don't think the peak is going to be as high as maybe we expected a couple of years ago, which really put a hard -- really put craft labor in a hard spot. But we feel like we're in a pretty good position on craft resources and being able to deliver those projects. So I feel pretty good about where we are in the U.S. Canada continues to be a great market for us as evidenced by the oil sands work that we continue to do. But then you look outside the United States, Latin America is a growth area for us, particularly Mexico. I think in Southeast Asia, there's more work, obviously, than just the Petronas project that we were awarded. But that's from China, Sakhalin all the way down into Southeast Asia I think are growth markets. The Middle East still continues to be a great place for us, and there's significant opportunity there as well as Southern Africa, both on the South and Eastern sides of the continent. So I think that everybody, over the last few years, has kind of salivated over the U.S. market. It's important. But from Fluor's perspective, it's only one piece of the pie for us. So like I say, I mean, we're a global company and have global reach, and that gives us access to a lot of capital spend.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then I guess for my follow-up, just on the equipment business. Just trying to get a flavor of when you expect the timing to sort of roll over from the Afghanistan work and mining work and when we'll start to see that reflected on the ramp in Oil & Gas.","David T. Seaton","Well, we're just starting to go to the field on a couple of projects in the U.S. with several more to come. So I think we\u2019re sometime next year when it kind of flattens out. I mean, we had a lot of business in Afghanistan for both -- primarily for other than Fluor, which took a bigger hit in Afghanistan relative to the forward operating base shutdowns and which assets actually stayed operating. So that was -- it's almost like the decline in Government is more exaggerated in our equipment business. But I tell you, it's a solid business and it's part of that critical path we need relative to having the equipment tools and things we need to build these things. So I believe that there are probably -- 20% of AMECO's business right now is actually Fluor work. I think that will shift dramatically as we get through next year.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, can you just comment on how the execution is going on your fixed-price projects right now?","David T. Seaton","Pretty good. I feel really good about where we stand. I mean, it's got the normal puts and takes as any project does, but I feel really good about where we are at this stage of the game on our fixed-price projects.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So no concerns there, it sounds like.","David T. Seaton","Remember, it's only 18% of our backlog.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And Biggs, how are you thinking about cash flow in Q4 and in 2015? And what are your latest thoughts about what to do with your international cash?","Biggs C. Porter","Okay. On the first question, as I said, there were some timing matters with respect to cash in the third quarter. As a matter of fact, I say that -- I always say that cash in any particular quarter can be heavily influenced by timing when you have really large receipts that come in right before the quarter end or a little bit afterwards. I think that the fourth quarter should be certainly better than the third quarter, absent some other timing phenomenon just hitting. As to 2015, I think, and going out to the [indiscernible], I expect a fairly normal relationship between cash and earnings. I think that with respect to international cash, there's no real change in philosophy. We've always said there could be some inefficiency associated with repatriation. It's kind of a country-by-country matter, and it gets fairly complex. There's no simple answer there. But we always just have to take that into consideration when we look at how we move money around the world or when we make determinations about how much excess we might have.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And maybe one last quick one. What have you guys assumed for the Chevron Kitimat, your guidance for next year?","David T. Seaton","We really don't guide project by project. But I can tell you that we are where we thought we would be.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Alex Rygiel with FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","David, in I&I, what needs to develop for some of the larger projects to move forward that you mentioned in the second half of 2015?","David T. Seaton","We're starting to see -- there is some improving -- improvement in some of the commodity markets. At least most of them feel that they've bottomed. And I think you've got some of the bigger mining companies that are looking at when things turn, it's all about who can put it on the water. And it's those big companies that are kind of revisiting copper, iron ore, a couple of other commodities, but mostly those 2. So the dialogue and the discussion in the FEED projects and the actual committing funds to get back in the game is prevalent right now. So again, I think we see some things moving as we get towards the second half of next year.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And secondly, can you update us on what the bid timeline is for the Kuwait refinery project? And then as it relates to Mozambique, it looks like Anadarko is having some success with a few supply deals. Has the timing of that project moved forward at all?","David T. Seaton","Well, Anadarko first. No, I think we're on the normal schedule of them choosing a contractor in the first quarter of next year. We feel really good about our position, and we'll continue to track that very closely. With regard to KNPC, they delayed the bid submittals until the end of the year. So we're probably mid-year before any of those packages are awarded, mid-year 2015.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just curious if you have seen any change at all in the competitive landscape in either the Oil & Gas or the I&I business.","David T. Seaton","Not really. I mean, I think -- well, let me back up. In Oil & Gas, I don't think I've seen a whole lot. I mean, it's a very competitive market, and I'm very pleased with our ability to compete in that difficult market. I think we're still -- I mean, when you think about I&I, you kind of got to break it into Mining & Metals and Infrastructure. In Mining & Metals, for the very, very large projects, I mean, obviously, they're competitive, but there's very few companies that can actually do some of that stuff. But in Infrastructure, particularly in the United States, it's extremely competitive. And we've had this dialogue before, and I really don't mean this to be an arrogant statement because I really don't mean it this way, but we have the ability to say no to some of the things that our competition can't say no to in terms of pricing and profit expectation because that's really the only segment that they chase and we can put people someplace else. So we're keeping our powder dry. We're being very diligent in the projects that we choose to chase and very diligent in how we bid them. It is very, very competitive. But as far as delivery relative to the PPP market in the United States, I don't think there's anybody better than Fluor.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And maybe can you talk about what percentage of your backlog in Oil & Gas is related to oil sands, directionally, how it's trending over the next [indiscernible] quarters?","David T. Seaton","I wouldn't go into giving you a specific percentage, but it's not dramatic.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, can you say more about the prospect list in the Middle East, Asia and Mexico, what end markets and project size to the extent you're comfortable fleshing those out for us?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think in Mexico, obviously, it's the Oil & Gas sector, to a lesser degree, petrochemicals, a little bit of Power. Latin America is basically the same mix. In the Middle East, it's all over the board from Infrastructure programs to offshore Oil & Gas, onshore Oil & Gas, petrochemicals, some Power. We feel pretty good about our position in the Middle East, but as I said, all of those areas have some pretty robust capital plans in front of us and I think we're pretty well positioned in all areas.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then in the U.S., can you just update us on the timing of contractor selection on Lake Charles LNG? Has that shifted around at all? And has FID moved around at all?","David T. Seaton","No. It's still next year.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly on the prospect list in the U.S. for I&I for the PPP projects. Can you talk about how visibility has evolved over the past quarter? Any changes? It sounds like you might be more optimistic this quarter than the last. But let me ask that question directly.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we had a flurry of them. If you go back to the beginning of the year and it's kind of settled out. I wouldn't say that we're heavily into the bidding cycle in some of these things. But when you look at what's in front of us, it's a mid-to-late next year kind of thing from a bid perspective. So again, when you think about our portfolio, we just keep layering things on top. And when we get into '16, I think it'll be back and a good contributor.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Yuri Lynk with Canaccord Genuity.","Yuri Lynk - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Most of my questions have been answered. I just have a couple of housekeeping items. Just on the SG&A, obviously, a big decline, I understand there's some stock-based comp in there. But would any of that decline be due to the restructuring initiatives you put in, in Oil & Gas to kind of flatten the organization?","David T. Seaton","I think some of it is, but I think the real benefit of that is probably in the out-years. We've really changed the game here. And I feel good about where we are from a cost-competitive perspective. Biggs, I don't know if you want to add any color to that.","Biggs C. Porter","No, I think that's accurate. There's benefits in there, but there's also still some costs associated with doing it as well. So I think the big driver is the comp expense being down on the lower share price.","Yuri Lynk - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay, got it. And Biggs, while I have you, how much is left on the buyback at present?","Biggs C. Porter","How many shares are left authorized?","Yuri Lynk - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Yes.","Biggs C. Porter","I think it's 9 million -- 8 million or 9 million. I'd have to look exactly.","Yuri Lynk - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","That's close enough for me.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sameer Rathod with Macquarie.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","A couple of questions here. What -- obviously, pretty volatile oil market. But in your mind, what do oil prices have to do and how long do they have to do them before the market cools down a bit here in North America or globally?","David T. Seaton","I kind of talked about that earlier. It's all a matter of perspective. I think that a moderating -- it's interesting. You look at one report. It says that oil is going to hit $70 and now quarters before it returns to $80. And another one leads us to $100 a barrel again in the near term. So it's somewhere in there. I think the commodity -- those commodity markets will drive them. But again, the CapEx of our customers and their eagerness to spend that on reserve replacement and product improvements didn't wane when it was at $80 or $70 the last time, and I don't expect it to this time. But just like anything else, I mean, if you have a dramatic drop, and I wouldn't even venture a guess as to what dramatic -- how you define dramatic, would have lots of people at least taking a deep breath. But my experience -- I've been here 30 years, my experience says that, that deep breath is measured in quarters, not years.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","Right, absolutely. I guess my next question is on the cost inflation in the Gulf. I know you said that you feel pretty good about the craft labor component. Are there specific specialties or anything that you're starting to see tightness in? Or have you seen a pickup in labor costs in the region? That's it for me.","David T. Seaton","Well, from a big projects perspective, and where we are from an execution standpoint, the 2 that stand out to me right now is the Dow project, PDH program as well as CPChem. We have not seen -- well, the labor costs are equal to what we thought they would be. The only tightness I would say is in welders. And we've beefed up our training program and actually have started a training school in the Houston area. So we think we'll be in a pretty good place relative to new people entering the market and the skills that they're going to need to be successful. So with things kind of moving around last year, early this year, from a timing perspective, I think it really dampened the issue that was out in front of us. And I think because we're kind of the first in the field on these projects, we're going to have -- we're going to create a better following on -- for the out projects and be able to maintain those resources over the longer term, if that makes sense.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andy Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Biggs, I wanted to start with you and just get some more detail on some of the items in the quarter. And specifically, you did mention that there was some closeouts in the I&I segment. I was hoping you could clarify those. As well as we noticed there was at least some gains either from equipment sales and\/or the exit from joint ventures. I was hoping you could give us the magnitude of those and what segments, if they are shown in the segment they appeared in.","Biggs C. Porter","I think it's a little finite to go into each and every project and talk about its effect. The -- as I said before, there's always going to be a certain amount of closeout activity, there's always going to be a certain number of adjustments on projects, positive and negative. And I just try to give you some flavor for whether or not they drive the margin rates in any particular quarter relative to the norm when we give those kind of comments about a particular group being possibly influenced by project performance or closeouts. So I don't think -- it just doesn't make sense trying to quantify. It's really more judgmental in its nature. And you're right, as we come -- as to -- on the AMECO side, as we come out of any project or come out of Afghanistan, there is going to be favorable profit typically because we are able to realize gain on sales. That's a normal phenomenon. It happens every quarter. And in this case, coming out of Afghanistan, it did have a little bit more than average effect in the quarter.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just because we all love pension accounting so much, I thought I'd dig into that a little bit. The -- is this -- was this a plan that was -- are you not accepting new entrants for? Or is this a buyout of all existing pensioners in the plan? And then you mentioned that it doesn't have a cash cost. Is that -- presumably, that's because you're just shutting down the plan, not actually buying folks out. But maybe some detail on that would be helpful.","Biggs C. Porter","Well, it's -- the answer to your first question really is both. The plan was frozen to new entrants several years ago. But what we're doing now is basically settling our obligations to all those participants. They can either take a lump sum or they get an annuity in return for the settlement. But they make those decisions out in the future after it has regulatory approval. As to the cash aspect of it, the plan is fully funded. If you look at it from an actuarial standpoint today, there is still going to be some cash costs, depending upon the elections that the participants make. Not to get even more technical about it, but we don't expect that additional cash cost to be significant, as we said.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful. And then can you talk about the impact that this is going to have in your '15 guidance on a year-over-year basis in the SG&A line?","Biggs C. Porter","The -- as we said, it's not really estimable at this point in time. The only thing that we can really point to is that it will trigger the recognition of what's previously been unrecognized prior service and actuarial costs, which is -- sits in OCI and that amounts to $160 million before tax. So we know we'll be taking the charge for that. But how much additional charge there is depends upon the final decisions made by all the participants and whether it's lump sum or annuities and a whole bunch of other variables.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. But in terms of just cost savings, though, I guess, is the angle that I was trying to [indiscernible] out there.","Biggs C. Porter","Savings, I'm sorry. Going forward, it's an excess of $10 million a year. Some of it, as I said, is we don't pay some of the administrative costs anymore in PBGC premiums. But also importantly, I think everybody expects PBGC premiums to be going up over time. So the savings probably grow if you think of it that way because we will be avoiding those future increases.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Indeed. Maybe last question for David. I think you highlighted that Russia was a driver in an upstream project of your Oil & Gas segment. I'm just kind of curious as to what you're thinking, how you're planning for, if you're planning for, the potential for U.S. sanctions to go deeper and how that can affect that part of the business.","David T. Seaton","What's under sanctions doesn't impact us at the moment, to your point. Who knows what deeper sanctions mean? But given where we are on most things we're chasing and everything else, I'm not too concerned about it at this point.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson Investment Bank.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","David, just a little clarity. In terms of your backlog now within your Oil & Gas segment, how would you break it out between upstream and downstream work? And then on the I&I side between Mining and Infrastructure, Metals & Mining?","David T. Seaton","From a backlog standpoint, I'd say upstream, downstream is probably close to 50-50, when you consider that I put petrochemicals in the downstream bucket. As far as Mining and Infrastructure, that's a hard one based on where we are, but it typically is 2 to 1 Mining over Infrastructure. That's probably a fair assessment right now. And then it grows from there when the big programs go in.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. That's where it is now. The Mining is still that order of magnitude.","David T. Seaton","Right.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just in terms of the Global Services business, smaller segment, but will that ramp up with the revenue on the Oil & Gas side pretty substantially?","David T. Seaton","It will ramp up. I don't know about -- how you define substantially, but I think it's going to be flat for the first part of this cycle because you've got a decrease from Afghanistan hitting AMECO as an example before we really start to ramp up on the Oil & Gas side. So I think probably flat for next year but improving margin in that business. Our Temporary Staffing business follows 1 to 1 what we do in engineering. So yes, as we ramp up on Oil & Gas backlog or burning the backlog, that should improve.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just last, I guess mainly for Biggs. In terms of the settlements on the Doe Run, when does that cash flow out?","Biggs C. Porter","As I said, it's only when we get releases from the plaintiffs, and so the timing\u2019s going to be based upon that.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","David, I won't ask you to predict the outcome of next Tuesday's election in the U.S. But...","David T. Seaton","I thought you were going to ask me to predict the Cowboys-Giants game.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, I just want to make sure you haven't bought your Super Bowl tickets yet.","David T. Seaton","After Monday, no. I put that on hold.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I figured as such. But if the consensus holds and the Republicans take over the Senate, is there anything from a legislative or regulatory issue that could help the velocity of some even more permitting or more opportunities for the business that you see in the United States?","David T. Seaton","Comprehensive tax reform and comprehensive immigration reform. I mean, I'm telling you, if we can get those 2 things right, given the momentum that's behind this economy, and get the regulators out of the way or at least not creating new obstacles, the American economy will be on fire again. I am so optimistic that -- well, I'm not optimistic. I'm so sure in that statement. There are so many question marks out there, whether it's the EPA situation with the Power guys, whether it's the regulators on the moratorium on export of oil products. If we can get the government to work with us and look at the job creation that's there, you look at the tax revenues, even at a lower rate, that can be generated by a growing economy, we wouldn't have -- we wouldn't be talking about the deficit problems and all the financial problems the United States have. But with that, I'll get off my soapbox. You got another question?","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","No, I think that's fine.","David T. Seaton","Michael, no kidding. I've been very vocal about this. As a member of the BRT and some of the other -- the National Association of Manufacturers, where I'm an executive board member, we got -- we can fix this, but there needs to be some rational thinking in Washington. And that is not a partisan comment because both sides of the aisle are part of the problem.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Duly noted. Do you think you still can be helped here?","David T. Seaton","I don't know. But I think what you're seeing is the Canadians looking elsewhere and the U.S. trying to figure it out without it. I wouldn't predict on -- I wouldn't give odds on that one right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Justin Ward with Wells Fargo.","Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Just a few on the Oil & Gas backlog. Obviously, it's very impressive at over 2x your Q3 revenue run rate. Can you give us a sense of how much of that $26 billion of backlog is expected to be completed in the next 12 months?","David T. Seaton","Very little. Like I said, we're kind of on the beginning phases of a growth curve. I mean, you've got some projects that are finishing up like BP Whiting, a few other big programs. But we're kind of in the early innings, if you will, on that backlog.","Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And so I guess considering it's pretty extended over the next few years, is there a sense of how much of that Oil & Gas backlog is potentially at risk if oil kind of stays in this $80 range? Or are you guys expecting all that to go forward regardless?","David T. Seaton","We're pretty conservative on how we take in projects in the backlog. I'm very confident about what's in backlog. If it were -- if oil prices were to drop significantly, I would be concerned about future awards but not what's in our backlog.","Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just one more. This earnings season, as we listen to all your Oil & Gas customers' earnings calls, there's a lot of discussion about expectations of kind of using the lower oil price environment to be more aggressive and getting some deflation -- some cost deflation from their supply chain. In light of that commentary, do you guys expect negotiations to become a bit more aggressive going forward if oil doesn't rebound in the next 6 months or so? And how do you guys generally prepare for that?","David T. Seaton","I don't see any difference in our oil customers. If the price was $200 a barrel, they would still be as difficult as if it's at $80 a barrel. It's never easy from a negotiation standpoint. They're always looking for better capital efficiency. And I think the thing this time that I feel I have confidence in is we kind of changed how we approach the market. That solution-driven total project approach is something that the customer is interested in, and we're competitive. One of the questions earlier was about how we feel about our lump sum projects. Well, we've competed in some pretty difficult markets head to head with global competitors, have won and I still feel very good about where we stand on those projects that are fixed price as well as the ones that are reimbursable. So not really a specific answer, but we can compete regardless of what the oil price is. And our friends in the oil industry are always difficult, very tough negotiators.","Operator","And we'll take our last question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just about made it. So I guess I had 2 quick questions. Number one, David, how do you feel about some of the NAFTA refineries coming back and becoming more economical? And if oil prices are around $80, $85, do you see some change in the dynamics marginally between the sort of ethane-based ones and NAFTA? That's my first question. And the second question is, David, a while back, you talked about self-perform. I've seen you guys book PMC rules on some pretty big scopes. Would you look at taking some risk on the self-perform side at this point given the craft labor issues seeming less pronounced? And would that potentially present more margin upside for you in the medium to longer term?","David T. Seaton","Well, controlling construction is part of our strategy, whether it's through our own resources or otherwise. But I'd point you to 2 projects in the Gulf Coast now. One is CPChem, which is lump sum turnkey utilizing fluid craft. And the other\u2019d be in the Dow Gulfstream project, which is PDH and the cracker. So we're already way down that road and feel very good about our position there. But I want to make sure you understand, that does not mean that we're going to direct hire every project around the world. So you look at -- I may be putting words in your mouth. I'm expecting that you're talking about Petronas when you talk about PMC. We're probably not going to do direct hire in Malaysia, but we will in the U.S., we will in Canada, we do in some places in the Middle East. We obviously do in Latin America. We obviously do in the Southern part of Africa already. So I don't see it as a change. I just see it as appropriate implementation of our overall construction strategy. I feel really good about where we stand there. Not to say that there won't be some pinch points in certain crafts, in certain regions just from a skill set standpoint, but we've got plans in place and training opportunities in place for people to where I think we'll stay reasonably ahead of the game. To your first question, I think it's a little too early to tell whether NAFTA creates a different wave of spending. I think most of these customers in their project cycles are a little bit further down the path to start questioning what the feedstock's going to be. So I think it's going to stay where it is at least in the near term.","Thank you, Tahira.","With that being the last question, I'll kind of prompt our operator here and thank everyone for participating in the call. But I think as you can see in the results of our third quarter, the Oil & Gas group continues to perform well and also has sizable list of prospects, both domestically and abroad, that we're focused on. And I'm pleased by our overall results to date, considering revenue has been impacted by a lack of opportunity at least in the near term in the Mining & Metals market. But looking to 2015, I believe we're in a great position to capture additional awards across all of our end markets. And we expect revenue to increase as our existing portfolio of Oil & Gas awards transition to the construction site.","Finally, I want to take a moment and take an opportunity to announce to the investment community that Ken Lockwood, our Vice President of IR and Corporate Finance, has elected to retire from Fluor after 34 years. He and I are kind of the old guys in the room, and I can tell you, I can't thank him enough for what he's done for this company. He's held a number of senior finance and operating roles in this company since he joined in 1980. I'm especially grateful for the integrity, professionalism and leadership that he's shown in this role over the past 10 years. And I know you'll all want to join me in wishing him just the very best in his retirement. And I wish him a well done. Ken and I have been through a couple of wars together here at Fluor, and I've come to rely on Ken quite a bit. And I wish you all the -- you and your family all the best in retirement.","Succeeding Ken will be Geoff Telfer, also a long-serving Fluor veteran, who for the past 11 years, has been the CFO of the Oil & Gas segment and prior to that was the Controller for Mining as well as other industries. He's been here as long as I've been here, too.","But I want to make sure that I acknowledge Jason Landkamer and the job that he's done and how well he's done in -- as the Director of Investor Relations. And obviously, he'll continue to be a very important person in our company and will continue in the role that he's done. I really don't have a chance in this kind of a forum to thank those guys that do this for us. But Jason, you and Ken are great folks to work with. And again, Ken, I wish you all the very best.","But with that, I really appreciate your interest and confidence in our company. I think we're in a good place for a pretty good growth spurt here, and I wish everyone a good day.","Operator","Thank you.

On today's call, we'll review our third quarter results relative to our preannouncement three weeks ago and discuss our outlook for the rest of this year.","Earnings attributable to Fluor in the third quarter were $77 million, or $0.55 per diluted share, compared with earnings of $94 million and $0.67 per diluted share a year ago. Bruce will talk about the financial details in his discussion.","If you turn to slide 3. For the third quarter new awards for Energy & Chemical segment were $644 million and ending backlog was $11.4 billion. At the beginning of October, the consortium behind the LNG Canada project reached a final investment decision with final notice to proceed being received this week. Fluor will book its $8.4 billion share of the approximately $14 billion contract in the fourth quarter.","Throughout the bidding and planning process for the LNG Canada project we have focused on identifying the biggest obstacles to success in creating a comprehensive mitigation strategy. We've relied on our zero-based execution approach, in addition to our supply chain and fabrication capability to enhance productivity and cost control.","We believe these key advantages along with our data driven execution approach provide a distinct competitive advantage for the large EPC project clients are developing. We continue to see a number of advantage projects that fit our pursuit profile over the next several quarters. These include LNG projects in Mozambique, chemical facilities including methanol facilities in the Gulf Coast, as well as further cracker complexes.","Turning to side 4, the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power group reported new awards of $5.4 billion for the third quarter and ending backlog with $16.5 million. This quarter we booked the Quellaveco copper mine in Peru and the Gordie Howe international bridge connecting Detroit, Windsor Canada.","Our mining backlog, within that group continues to grow and now stands at $8.1 billion, up from $4.8 billion in the last quarter. Building off our success in mining and infrastructure we're currently tracking prospects in copper, gold and bauxite for infrastructure, and we're continuing currently pursuing projects in Illinois, Virginia and Texas.","Turning to slide 5, the Government group reported new awards for the quarter of $3.3 billion, which included the DOE extension in Savannah River through 2019, Portsmouth D&D contract through 2021 and the strategic petroleum reserve contract through 2024. Ending backlog was $5.1 billion. For 2009 (sic) [2019] (4:59), we are well positioned to win the liquid waste contract at Savannah River and the LOGCAP V contract.","If you turn to slide 6, in the Diversified Services segment, they reported new awards of $336 million, which includes a two-year extension for Stork's delivery integrator specialist, asset integrity services for the offshore production platforms located in Central North Sea. Ending backlog for the quarter is $2 billion. While revenue for the quarter was lighter than our expectation, this is the first time we've seen a book-to-bill ratio above 2.0 in the last 10 years. We believe this is a meaningful indicator of a strong beginning to the cycle.","Finally, I want to share with you an update on the two projects relayed at our pre-announcement that we released a few weeks ago. On our Citrus gas fire project in Florida, I'm pleased to say that one of the power blocks has been placed in service by our client and the other power block is completing the planned catalyst replacement outage following successful steam blows.","On our downstream project in Europe, the client has commissioned the facility and will achieve commercial operations, both of these projects will be complete this year.","And with that, I'll turn it over to Bruce. Bruce?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 9. Revenue for the third quarter was $4.7 billion, compared to $4.9 billion a year ago. The decline in revenue can be attributed to the lower-than-anticipated ramp in mining, infrastructure and energy, chemicals projects. We expect this shift to benefit future years. Corporate G&A expense for the third quarter was $65 million, compared to $46 million a year ago. G&A expense for the quarter includes $21 million related mostly to UK pension closeout related expenses and some foreign exchange fluctuations.","Turning to slide 10, and as David mentioned, for the quarter, we reported net income attributed to Fluor of $77 million, or $0.55 per diluted share.","Results for the quarter include a tax rate of 34% compared to 29% last quarter. This higher than anticipated tax rate is due to the company being impacted by certain foreign charges that could not be tax benefited. $81 million in pre-tax charges on two projects as noted in our pre-announcement call and $125 million pre-tax gain on sale of our investment in Seagreen Wind Energy, also noted on our pre-announcement call.","We have provided some highlights from the balance sheet on slide 11. In August, we completed a $600 million senior unsecured notes offering, maturing in 2028. The yield on this oversubscribed offering was 4.25%. We used $500 million of the proceeds to pay off $500 million of senior unsecured notes due in 2021. Fluor's cash plus marketable securities for the quarter was $1.9 billion versus $1.8 billion last quarter.","At the end of the quarter our available domestic cash balance was 21% of total cash. This includes excess proceeds from the notes offering and increased cash flow from operations, including the receipt of cash from the government related to our power restoration project in Puerto Rico. We continue to make good progress toward driving this ready cash balance up to the $1 billion target we previously shared.","And now if you turn to slide 12, I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for the rest of 2018. We anticipate earnings for 2018 of $1.80 to $1.90 per diluted share. This excludes any impact of foreign exchange fluctuations or UK pension settlement expenses, which may occur in the fourth quarter.","This guidance assumes G&A expense of approximately $50 million, again excluding any impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, integration, or pension expenses, and a tax rate of 25% to 30%.","If you turn to slide 13, we anticipate average margins for the remainder of 2018 in the Energy & Chemicals segment to be in the 5% to 6% range; Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure, & Power, excluding NuScale to be in the 2.5% range; Government to be approximately 3%; and Diversified Services to be around 4% to 5%.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And our first question is from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good evening. So I'm not going to push you tonight on the base of earnings as we think about 2019, I'll try to behave. But instead, can you just help me understand, you guys talked a bit...","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, right.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I'll try, I won't at the Analyst Day though. But anyway, can you \u2013 you talked at the pre-announcement about sort of the deferral of engineering work from Q3. Any clarity on how much of that goes into Q4 versus 2019?","My second question, David, the margins that you guys are implying for Energy & Chemical in the fourth quarter are probably better than what the market expected. So is there anything unusual about that or is there \u2013 I mean, I'm assuming that's an okay way to think about 2019?","And then my last question is obviously, some of your peers are having financial issues. Some of your peers are getting out of the ECR business. Can you just talk about, given those changes, is there more work or awards coming to you than you would have expected? Or is it too early to know? Thank you.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Start with the last one, Jamie, I think it's too early to know. The pursuit strategies and proposals that we have underway haven't really been impacted by that. Maybe it changes what the customers are thinking. But none of those projects that we've been pursuing has changed their schedule or their approach because of changes in the competitive slate.","On the margin, there is nothing unusual in what we've reported, you know, we're kind of in that, an interesting place where we're ramping up, but we're not there yet. And one example is how in particular the two methanol projects have slipped almost over a year, and in fact one of them, I'd say both of them are next year from an award standpoint. So that's really the basis for why we kind of had this slow ramp, if you will, in the second half of the year because we really expected those to have been awarded at least by mid this year. So we've missed it by at least two quarters.","Operator","And our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Thanks. Good afternoon.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good afternoon, Steven.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","David, you gave us a bit of an update on the project here. So how confident are you that Q4 is going to be actually free of charges and the start of a track record of clean quarters? And then is the nearly $0.70 kind of run rate the way to think about the starting point for 2019, with a ramp over the course of the year?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I'm not going to talk about 2019 yet, but we'll provide some color as we as get to the investor conference. I can't promise you anything. All I can tell you is that those two projects are all but complete. The news on the in-service on power block 1 is huge and was significantly ahead of the schedule that we had set. And we expect second power block to do the same thing.","And on the project in Europe, I mean, they're in commercial operation now. So there's just follow-on stuff, dribs and drabs, but we've accounted for those as we do \u2013 as we thought we did in the quarters before. But, as you well know, I've been burdened by those two projects for most of this year. So I'm not going to predict anything, but I will say I've got confidence that we see the very end.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then clearly next quarter we're going to finally see that inflection in backlog in the E&C segment. So how much of a lag do you think it would be before we start to see the revenues have the year-over-year inflection? Is that going to be as soon as potentially Q1?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, I think with rev rec you're going to see something different than you've seen in your models before. In that the margin profile is going to be over the five years of that \u2013 just using LNG Canada as an example, the earnings will be over that five years, you won't have the spike in earnings in the engineering phase like we've had before, which I think is actually good thing because you'll be able to model it in a much more smooth way than trying to anticipate where we are in that EPC cycle. So I think that it's going to start to ramp as we get through 2019 when you start layering all of these big projects that we put in backlog in mining as well as what's coming in in E&C. So we're going to be building through the years, I guess, is the way I would articulate it.","Steven Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","Operator","And our next question is from Tahira Afzal from KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, folks.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hi, Tahira. How are you?","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Doing well. So, if you really look out to \u2013 David if you look out to all the moving pieces on the geopolitical side, is it kind of changing your prospects by any chance, obviously demand and supply seem to still be in your favor, but in terms of how you prioritize your key prospects, is anything changing over there?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Not really. It's a great question. There is a lot of noise, but we haven't seen any behavioral changes on behalf of our clients, whether what \u2013 you picked the political kerfuffle, whether it's the Saudis or tariffs or whatever. We really haven't seen any change in behaviors and I really don't anticipate it. And that goes back to when I was in the Middle East and the Iraqis were still throwing Scud missiles out. It did not slow any of the decision making then. So I don't think we're going to see much of a attitude change on the part of our clients. On the tariff side, and I'll just use the Gordie Howe project as an example. When we bid that job, we were careful of whether there would be the new NAFTA or whatever acronyms that stands for now, I don't even know what it is. I just call it the new NAFTA. When you take steel as an example, anything that's bought from the Canadian side is Canadian steel and everything that's bought on the U.S. side is U.S. steel. Because of the sophistication of our supply chain, that's an easy thing for us to deal with. And I would say that that example applies just about any place around the globe.","In China, we're certainly seeing harsher attitudes, but not much more than we normally see. But there is clearly projects in China that we're pursuing with great gusto right now and feel pretty good about our position. So, I don't even think what's happening between the U.S. and China will stop that spending because both the major customers that we're dealing with aren't U.S. based customers.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay, David. And, David, I saw that there was a big retrofit for Exxon I believe in Singapore that just got announced over the last couple of months. It seems multibillion dollar potentially and it seems to be tied to IMO 2020. Are we starting to see some opportunities emerge there? Is it too early and are you kind of skeptical in terms of the bigger opportunities that will ever arise from that?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Again, I think the cadence of those types of projects are going to follow the cadence that we've expected. I don't think there's any action that will speed things up, if you will. But when you look at that part of the world, I'll just pick refining, they don't produce in the volumes necessary to supply that local demand. So they're going to have to do some things to have those raw fuels as an example. So they're a little bit behind where the Europeans are a little bit ahead.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","David or Bruce, you guided to $125 million in pre-tax profit when you pre-announced earlier this month and you came in at $146 million, I guess, this was earlier last month. What happened between when you pre-announced and now? Were you able to realize some extra benefit versus your initial expectations? And then it appears your underlying margin E&C is in the low to mid 5% range. I know Jamie asked the question, but if I look at the 5% to 6% E&C margin in Q4, is that sort of the bottom here assuming that the projects that you've already announced start to ramp-up?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I'll let Bruce answer that.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Okay. Thanks, David. Thanks Andy for the question. Let me answer your second question first relative to kind of the E&C margin. So we have EBIT in E&C of little over $50 million for the quarter. And if you kind of adjust back for that downstream European project that's $46 million but also included in their business is an embedded derivative where we're long on the dollar. So when the dollar weakens against the peso, we suffer there and we had about a $15 million adjustment there. So we kind of make those adjustments. We're at about $111 million of EBIT to a revenue of about $1.9 billion. So in the high 5s there for margins. So they're kind of something you don't see on the top line of our statements, so.","Relative to $125 million to $146 million, well, this is the problem when you pre-release of course is we just simply hadn't closed the books on all of our projects or thousand projects around the world and some came a little stronger than we had predicted. It's no single aberration at all in the quarter at all, it's just generally the project is doing better than planned.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's helpful, Bruce. And then maybe I could ask sort of a follow up question and when I look at MII&P margin, it does look weak, excluding the fixed price power charge. But we know there's disruption that must be coming there from the fixed price business ramping down, from the power business ramping down. You guys have talked about sort of discontinuing that business at least in terms of the fixed price gas projects.","So why shouldn't we start to see margin actually ramp up in that business over the next year or two? Maybe back to where margins used to be in that business, call it mid single-digits ex-NuScale, as some of the bigger fixed price infrastructure jobs you're working on really start to ramp up?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","I think, Andy, you kind of answered some of your question there. We did report margins over 2% for the quarter in that unit, of course we need them to be higher, want them to be higher. But it's kind of a combination of the CFM that's going through the mining business now, that's coming in in large order with the big mining projects, which of course goes through our books at no margin.","And then it also is, as you mentioned, kind of the startup of these large infurtive (23:03) jobs that we have to be kind of in the field a while before we actually start hitting the revenue and income burns. So projects like the LA people-mover and the Gordie Howe, like David mentioned, as they come and get more on the ground, that's when we'll see the pickup in earnings and in margin.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And, Bruce, that really could be next year, correct?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, we fully do expect to be next year, but more back-end loaded next year. And wait a minute, I'm not supposed to talk about next year so...","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That's helpful, guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I think you tracked (23:37) my comment of the layering effect of these big projects and how they're starting.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Understand, David.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah, great. Thanks. I guess my question is for Bruce. Just looking at the Q, it looks like the new rev rec standard added $52 million of revenue versus the prior accounting standard. And that came through at almost 100% profit. So that's like $0.27.","I guess my question is like, can you just talk about how that comes through? And what the implications are and what you're assuming in your fourth quarter guidance in terms of the rev rec benefit? And will this normalize, where you won't be getting such a big tailwind as you move into 2019?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, good question, Andy. And we stopped guiding on rev rec alone, because it's kind of been a bit all over the map quarter-by-quarter. And you saw that number. I think, it's might \u2013 looking about $50 million for the quarter. But we're in the same ballpark.","Really what we're seeing from the rev rec, and it's mostly in our Energy & Chemicals business, is that's very much \u2013 it's offsetting against this engineering shift that David talked about earlier. So kind of looking at the overall impact of that, it is normalizing our earnings now.","Now how it actually works is, we recognized this rev rec back through our income statement. At the beginning of this year, we took a negative adjustment to retained earnings. So we earned that retained earnings back. So it goes through the income statement, then it replenishes our retained earnings and shareholder equity there. It's kind of just the accounting movement of it.","But we really have moved now to the same basis as our peers in this sector. So in other words, everybody has been recognizing it this way and not separating these performance obligations and recognizing the engineering revenue at much higher margin and the construction margin much lower. And it flattens it out, as David was saying, and kind of flattens it out over multi years. So a much easier model to work, but it is a change for us.","Now this table we put in our Q, we're required to do that for the whole of this year. Beginning in next year, and we plan on the new rev rec. We really don't in running the business, separate it all, it's what the projects are producing. If that helps?","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes. It's great. So this is the only year where we'll get the disclosure. It may or may not be in there next year, but we won't know. Is that kind of the summary, is how it affects the \u2013 what we should look at in 2019?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Yeah. It won't really matter to us or our peer group. We'll be in line with our peers.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, gentlemen.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Michael.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","David, I was intrigued by your prepared remarks on the services business and the high book-to-bill. You maybe could elaborate on that. Is it a U.S.-Europe type business? Are there more maintenance opportunities? It's just there's a lot more OpEx spending, and we're in the early parts of an upturn in that cycle for Fluor's ability for their clients \u2013 for your clients to move even further down the line on investment?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","No. I think it's just the layering that I've been talking about is as we've talked \u2013 this is the first year in 10 years we've been able to have this kind of performance. And I think it is the indicator that the slack (27:17) was changing. It's been a difficult period of time and we're finally starting to see kind of the fruits of our labor, whether it's the integrated solutions approach to ability to do true EPC work, which is what our customers are asking for. The diversity of our offering, I think it's all kind of coming together and like, I said, I think we're in the early stages of what's going to be a pretty robust several years.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And then my follow-up into your infrastructure and mining business. Do you \u2013 mining backlog picking up pretty nicely, is there going to be a lag before another wave maybe in the second half of 2019 and 2020 and do you see maybe a higher end market or end point through the mining backlog as we move into say 2020, 2021. And on the infrastructure side, I want to ask you about what you think is going to happen next Tuesday politically, but is there a sense or something that could come out of Washington, maybe on the infrastructure side that could benefit the industry and you guys in your opportunities.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","On the mining question, it is going to be Phase 1 and Phase 2. We won't have the same sort of ramp up in 2019 in new awards, there's still going to be some good awards. But 2020 is shaping up to be bigger than what we've seen in 2018 in terms of new awards for mining. So I think, as I've told you before, I think there's a longer tail on this cycle for both mining and oil and gas. So I'm pretty bullish about mining over the longer term and these projects are three, four, five years just like the E&C project. So again, when you start thinking about that layering of those big projects and a more stable earnings stream, I think we're in for a lot more stability going forward with increased profitability.","On your question about next Tuesday, who knows, I know that in my conversations, neither Congress or the Senate were going to give the President two wins in a year, maybe in tax, infrastructure is probably next. If I'm to prognosticate, if the Democrats take the House, my guess is that there'll probably be more money asked for, and whether that actually becomes reality. I don't know. Obviously the spending bills have to be ratified by both bodies.","So, you're going to have the Senate, you're going to have OMB that are a little tighter with the dollar than maybe the other side. But I think we'd get an infrastructure bill done next year. And I think that's going to be good for the country and good for us. Certainly, we've been pretty successful and we're bidding a lot of programs now and I think that under the current leadership, they've opened their aperture and I think their breadth is greater going into this.","So I think they've got more capacity in the next wave. So I'm pretty optimistic about some sort of infrastructure bill and it having some benefit on us. But let's say it gets past mid next year to third quarter next year, you're into 2020, 2021 before anything gets actually put to paper and awarded. But that's okay because that's going to be building that business over the longer-term, over and above what I think is a pretty robust market for us right now.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","David, thanks for your thoughts. Look forward to seeing you in a couple of weeks.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Michael.","Operator","And our next question is from Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good evening, guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good evening.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I just want to just follow up on maybe your LNG opportunities. I think you outlined a couple of sizable projects, but realistically kind of how many of those projects can you take on from engineering capacity or modular fabrication capacity. And if you do have an opportunity to get more than one additional project, if I do have to reinvest into additional modular fabrication capacity?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Great question. I think we've got capacity well above one or two for two reasons. One is, as you look at LNG Canada with full notice to proceed, we'll be well down the road on design before any of the other ones are actually awarded, which means that we'll just ship that project team over, in some cases to the second project and I would say the third would be the same. We're kind of looking at those projects in that kind of a schedule lens as to what fits the infrastructure we have.","I don't see an issue with our leadership in that regard or the supply chain pieces that we have. Fabrication, we may end up depending on where we are with the other businesses looking at that next phase of the yard in China, but it's not a huge investment for us if we have to go in that direction. So, I think, us making sure that we're timing these projects properly and they fit kind of us with the ability to implement these things from a supply chain standpoint, I think we're in pretty good position.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. And just a more philosophical question on why you would like to build out the cash cushion in North America of $1 billion, just looking at your working capital, it's relatively neutral, you're going to get some prepayments from customers for working capital. Why not use some of the extra free cash flow for kind of incremental buyback or just, I don't know, signal investors that you feel good about your growth prospects. Just can you walk me through your thinking why you need that cushion?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Yeah. Thank you, Anna. Certainly \u2013 we've established this target of the $1 billion ready cash because of kind of what we experienced in the \u2013 with the government contract in Puerto Rico, how we pushed out nearly $1 billion of cash in 45 days to fund that operation. Of course, as I've said before, that money is coming back with earnings on top of it and we should have that receivable cleared by the end of the year. It's important to have that cash to go.","Also as these FIDs start to stack up on one another in this dual up cycle between mining and Energy & Chemicals, we really see that as a bit of a security blanket or a war chest for our cash. If you look at our cash for the quarter, we've increased our total cash by about $140 million, up to a little over $1.9 billion, and about half of that was from operating cash. The other half was from our debt offering and how much we borrowed above what we had to pay off that bullet bond for. But to answer your question the second half directly, the buyback is not off the table. We just want to make sure we're secured first to take care of our normal operations, to service our shareholders through dividend and then we'll look at other opportunities for both maybe very, very niche acquisitions but also buyback for sure.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Hi. Good afternoon and good evening.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good afternoon, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","David, you also had excellent bookings in mining so far. This quarter we've heard from a number of miners about taking more of a wait-and-see approach in light of concerns about global trade in their outlook for China. I'm wondering in your discussions as you alluded to in the next wave of mining projects, are you seeing feasibility studies getting pushed out? Any projects where you're seeing actually the rubber meet the road, if you will, and actual push outs for feasibility studies?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We're actually seeing feasibility studies pick up. There's a lot of pent up demand. So as you look through 2019, a lot of the awards in mining are going to be those kinds of studies, which leads to 2020.","Now obviously, they got to get to the FID on the full investment. I'm pretty confident that even with the uncertainty that you see today, that they're going to get to the point where they need the capacity, they need the ore on the water. Because as you well know in the commodity market, if you can't put the ore on water, you're not going to have the cash to go with it.","So I anticipate study work to continue to grow, despite the challenges politically right now. And I do think a lot of those projects are going to go to a positive FID as we get into 2020.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And from a margin standpoint, you folks are guiding to, at the midpoint anyway, margins in Energy & Chemicals of 5.5%, compared to, excluding charges, of closer to 5% in the third quarter. Can you just talk about what you folks expect to improve sequentially 4Q versus 3Q in that business?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, Jerry, I think I talked about it, a little bit of that here with obviously the impact of this charge we took on the downstream project. But that embedded derivative is kind of a bit of an unknown for us quarter-to-quarter as we have currency risk there.","But margins there are continuing to guide on a go-forward basis in our 6% to 7% range. But we did pull that back to the 5% to 6%, just for the fourth quarter.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And, Bruce, so just to clarify, the 5% to 6% includes a headwind from currency?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","No. No. We don't plan currency. That's too much of a guessing game for us and for a lot of people, so...","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And finally, from a tax rate standpoint, obviously a lot of moving pieces drove a higher tax rate this year. As you folks think about the long-term tax rate outlook, anything that we should keep in mind in terms of what the tax structure could look like, based on the project mix that you have in backlog now over the next couple of years?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","No, Jerry, actually, the tax guidance that we gave of 25% to 30% still really holds on a run basis for us. We don't see really revisiting that obviously in the quarter.","When we took a loss outside the United States in the jurisdiction that we did, we didn't have the benefit of taking that tax benefit on our U.S. tax rate. So that drove up our U.S. tax \u2013 our tax basis overall. So we don't expect any more. We certainly haven't planned any more adjustments like that. So our run rate looks reasonable to us.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good evening, everybody.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hey, Chad.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Just wanted to go to Diversified Services. Can you talk about the project pipeline there? And then also maybe dig into the AMECO operation, just given that you guys have a number of projects going to the field next year between mining, LNG. And I just want to understand how to think about margins as your utilization picks up there?","Then secondly, could you perhaps talk a little bit about how we should think about NuScale in 2019?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","So on Diversified Services, one of the problems we had is the spending in oil and gas being so low for so long, that is the main business that Stork is in.","That spending habit is changing to where there's quite a few opportunities available to us as we start to get into next year. Their bid slate's pretty full, but it's a highly competitive market. But I do feel pretty good about their ability to grow as we get through next year from what I would argue is probably their low point.","AMECO, same thing, it's going to follow the construction stuff. And I think as you said, I think we'll start to see a pickup there, both in terms of servicing Flour but also in terms of servicing some of the mining companies, because that is one of the areas that they focus on, and in the past been a good earner for them. So, I think that's the case. Relative to NuScale we signaled that we will have a significantly less spend on NuScale in 2019 and beyond, not going to really signal anything more than that, but we are in the process of looking at partners and potential people to sell part of the venture to, but in terms of Fluor's expenditure, it will be significantly less than it was in 2018.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. And then over to the infrastructure market, I know, you've had a couple of larger awards, but I think earlier you've been talking about seeing few more one-sies and two-sies, just want to see, why that slate has changed, and you're starting to see larger projects and perhaps more P3s and just how to think about that pipeline as we look towards the next 12 months.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","One of the issues we have with infrastructure is just the gestation period of the bids. The timeframe to get from kind of the RFP to an award is a lot longer in that market because of some of the public-private partnership issues and pulling those funding vehicles together. It takes a lot longer to get one across the finish line. So that's really what's driving my comment about how robust it's going to be. But I did say that the management team that we've got in place now has kind of opened the aperture. And that's with what we're calling Fluor Heavy Civil. Those are some of the smaller road jobs that are taking place in places like Texas and Virginia and South Carolina and in Arizona. And we're being very successful and those are some of the smaller projects.","But from a utilization of equipment and people, it's very healthy to that business, and that is actually picking up. We're seeing a significant uptick in terms of the number of projects we're bidding. So again, I think that we're building a more sustainable infrastructure model as opposed to being a big game hunter, if you will, for some of the marquee projects that are out there. We're still going to do that. We're still going to go after those with gusto. But I think we've got a little bit more balanced portfolio within the infrastructure group going forward.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. I'll leave it there. Thank you.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer. Mr. Seaton, at this time I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you very much.

Please go ahead, Mr. Lockwood.","Ken Lockwood","Thanks very much, operator. And welcome everyone to Fluor's Fourth Quarter and 2013 Year End Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. As you know our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after market closed and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making our prepared remarks today.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in the Company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today as well.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are also posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","So with that I'd like to turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David Seaton","","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon everybody and thank you for joining us. On today's call we will review fourth quarter and full year 2013 results and also discuss our outlook for 2014. If you turn to Slide 3, I would like to start with 2013 full year performance. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for 2013 were $668 million or $4.06 per diluted share, which is up from $456 million and $2.71 per diluted share in 2012. Our financial results in 2013 met our expectations and we continue to be very encouraged by the significant and sustained progress of our Oil & Gas group.","Consolidated segment profit for 2013 rose to $1.2 billion, up from $769 million a year ago. Increased segment profit for 2013 reflects growth in Oil & Gas, power and government segments, partly offset by declining in mining and metals. Fluor's Oil & Gas business posted especially strong results with a 32% increase in segment profit, strong revenue growth and margin improvement. Consolidated revenue of $27.4 billion for 2013 was comparable with 2012, reflecting growth in Oil & Gas and power which was offset, as I said, with revenue reductions in other segments.","Full year new awards were $25.1 billion, comprised of $12.9 billion in Oil & Gas, $6.6 billion in industrial and infrastructure and $4.1 billion in government with $1.5 billion in power. Consolidated backlog at the end of the year was $34.9 billion, which compares with $38.2 billion a year ago, as I said, reflecting continued decline in mining and metals awards and the fourth quarter cancelation of our contract for Pascua Lama in South America.","If you would please turn to Slide 4 for some recent highlights. In the fourth quarter the Oil & Gas segment booked new awards of $4.2 billion including the North West Redwater refinery upgrade project in Canada and additional scope on a major upstream gas processing project in Kazakhstan. Ending backlog for Oil & Gas segment rose 10% from a year ago and at $1.3 billion sequentially to end 2013 at $20 billion.","As you know in January we announced the award of an engineering, procurement construction contract by Chevron and Apache for the proposed Kitimat LNG facility in British Columbia. We are extremely pleased we selected with our partner JGC for this strategically important project which is on track to become Canada's first major LNG production and export terminal. We believe that winning this project positions us well for other full scale LNG projects. In industrial and infrastructure, the backlog at the end of the year was $10.5 billion which is down from $17.2 billion last year. This decline was driven by lower mining awards in 2013 and the fourth quarter cancelation of Pascua Lama which I noted earlier removing $1.8 billion from our backlog. While we continue to support the water treatment facilities for Pascua Lama and helping wind down the project, our original EPCM contract has been canceled.","Fourth quarter new awards in industrial and infrastructure were $340 million, including a number of maintenance contract renewals.","If you would turn to Slide 5, the Government group posted fourth quarter new awards of $1.1 billion. Our ending backlog at 2013 was $2.4 billion. In the Power segment fourth quarter new awards were $146 million, including early engineering on a proposed nuclear facility in U.S. and renewal of several power maintenance contracts. Ending backlog for Power was $2 billion which compares to $1.9 billion a year ago.","During the quarter NuScale was selected by the Department of Energy to receive funding that will support the development, licensing and the commercialization of the Company's nuclear small module reactor technology. We're in the process of negotiating the terms of the agreement with DOE, which is expected to provide approximately $200 million in cost sharing funds over the next four years. We are pleased with DOE selection in NuScale, which we believe provides independent validation of our view of the commercial viability of a safe, reliable and scalable small modules of reactor technology. We're in the process of seeking potential investors, manufacturers and other supply chain partners.","With that I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review the details of our operating performance, corporate financial metrics as well as our outlook for 2014. Biggs?","Biggs Porter","","Thanks David and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. I want to start by providing some additional comments on our performance for the fourth quarter. Revenue for the quarter was $6.3 billion, which compares to $7 billion last year, mainly due to a significant reduction in the mining and metals business line. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the fourth quarter of 2013 was $167 million or $1.01 per diluted share, which compares to a loss of $4 million of $0.03 per diluted share in 2012.","As you may recall, the fourth quarter net loss of $0.03 in 2012 was affected by $1.61 per share charge on an offshore wind farm project, a $0.17 per share benefit from the sale of our interest in a Telecommunications Company and a $0.26 per share benefit from the favorable resolution of various tax items.","The effective tax rate in the fourth quarter of 2013 was approximately 31%, including benefits from research and development tax credits and a domestic production activity deduction, which were partially offset by the adverse tax effect from foreign loss without tax benefit. Fourth quarter segment profit was $318 million, including improved contributions from the Oil & Gas, Global Services and Government groups.","Turning to Slide 7, Government results in the fourth quarter included approximately $57 million related to the favorable resolution of various issues with the U.S. government. There were essentially three separate events that made up to $57 million and these are discussed in our Form 10-K. We assumed a certain amount of benefit to result from these items in our guidance, but we didn't necessarily expect all these issues to get resolved in the fourth quarter. While it may seem somewhat unique, it is similar in nature to close outs that we regularly see in the commercial business lines, when contingencies [ph] are released upon resolution of the associated issues. Partially offsetting these benefits were increased proposal and other overhead costs in the government group in the quarter.","With regard to government backlog beginning this quarter, we elected to include the unfunded portion of our multi-year government contracts at Savannah River and Portsmouth in order to be more comparable with industry practice. The fourth quarter 2013 included new awards and unfunded backlog of $983 million. We will separately identify the unfunded amounts in our financial reporting going forward.","Moving to Slide 8, as previously mentioned Fluor's consolidated backlog at year-end was $34.9 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 20% at quarter end and the mix by geography was 36% U.S. and 64% non U.S.","Turning to Slide 9, corporate G&A expenses in the fourth quarter of 2013 were $65 million, which compares with $41 million a year ago, a significant rise in our stock price during the fourth quarter gross stock price driven compensation expenses higher by 12 million. G&A also demonstrated a more normal seasonal trend in 2013, which resulted in higher fourth quarter expense.","Shifting to the balance sheet, Fluor's financial condition remains very strong, with cash plus current and non-current marketable securities totaling $2.7 billion. This compares with the balance of $2.6 billion a year ago. During 2013 the Company generated $789 million in cash flow from operating activities, repurchased $200 million worth of Fluor shares and paid out $79 million in dividends. In its most recent meeting, Fluor's Board of Directors voted to increase the quarterly dividend to a new rate of $0.21 per share, up from $0.16 per share.","With regard to share repurchases, we repurchased $200 million worth of shares in the fourth quarter and are in the process of repurchasing another $200 million more in the current quarter. As a result Fluor's Board has approved a 6 million share increase in the Company's share repurchase authorization, which after considering first quarter repurchases will bring the total number of shares available for repurchase to over 12 million shares.","I will conclude my remarks by providing an update on our guidance for 2014, which is on Slide 10. We are encouraged by the Company's strong prospects for continued growth, especially Oil & Gas. We are maintaining our EPS guidance for 2014 at the previously announced range of $4.10 to $4.60 per diluted share. We expect the first quarter 2014 to be lower than the fourth quarter of 2013 as reported and then expect steady quarterly improvement for the balance of 2014. Guidance for 2014 assumes that G&A expense will be in the range of $170 million to $180 million, an effective tax rate of 32% to 33%.","With that operator we're ready to take questions.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andy Kaplowitz with Barclays.","","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays","The Oil & Gas margins had a nice uptick in 4Q; you've been talking about it. Do you think you're still on track for the 5% margin that you sort of alluded to in the second half of this year? And could you tell us how much of the improvement that you saw in 4Q is based on better mix versus better pricing? And then maybe just a follow on to that David around, do you have to take extra risk to get to these higher levels, because we do notice more of us can [indiscernible] that Flour is taking. So maybe you can talk about that?","David Seaton","First, I am pretty bullish on where we're headed with Oil & Gas. I think the early wins that I mentioned and have been in the press here the last couple of days, I think do a couple of things for us. One, it validates our ability to capture our fair share or maybe more than our fair share of some strategic programs at margins that should see rise. I stick with my previous comments about the margin going up. I wouldn't predict when but I think that I would be disappointed if we didn't start with a five as we get towards the end of this year or early next year, because I think we're kind of in the early beginning stages of these programs and as you say, there are some fixed price projects that will be like the Power and Infrastructure programs where significant profitability drops in at the end.","We have not seen our risk profile increase based on the new awards that we're booking right now. Yes, there are some that are fixed price in nature but I would say that we feel very comfortable in taking the projects that we are on a fixed price basis and that's not just in Oil & Gas but I would say across the Company. We feel pretty good about our ability to execute against that.","I think the increase that you're seeing is part of the mix change but I think it's also a recognition that we've got a value proposition that lets us get paid for the value that we provide. I just feel really positive about where we are and where we're headed. I have great confidence in our teams in being able to deliver the profitability that we expect.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays","David, that's really helpful. And then maybe kind of a similar question around backlog. Can you talk about your confidence that your overall backlog can rise from here as mining sort of washes out here and as you continue to book Oil & Gas and then do you need one of the big LNG projects that we've booked in 2014 Oil & Gas backlog to continue to rise?","David Seaton","There is no doubt in my mind that backlog will increase as we get started in 2014.","Operator","Next we move on to Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Well, I guess, a couple of questions. One, your wins in Oil & Gas have been fairly impressive. Your market share is sort of at unprecedented levels. Can you talk about your concerns overall with capacity that you have, just given how much work that you've won? And I think the other dynamic that was very interesting last cycle was you were -- the market got high enough and you were in such demand that you got to a point where you really wouldn't do the feed work unless you pretty had a higher than average probability of getting the EPC. Can you talk about where you are with your customers and in that regard? And then I guess my last question is you won so much in Oil & Gas already. I mean, when you think about your prospect list for 2014, can you just sort of size that versus where we were sitting here last year, just because you've already won so much work year-to-date? Thanks.","David Seaton","There's always a but with you, Jamie.","Jamie Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","And Peter got a promotion. So I assume that means great -- better than 5% margin towards the end of the year.","David Seaton","You're not asking that question. I think we've just began with regard to Oil & Gas. Granted, I think that there are some very large programs that will come into backlog in the first half of the year but there is a lot more out there that we're pursuing. So I think that what's in front of us today is much bigger than what it was in the last cycle. And I think what we've done and how we've invested in our people and our tools and systems over the last two or three years have really taken a lot of the question relative to capacity out of our equation.","We feel really good about the talent that we've got to execute these projects. We feel really good about how we've kind of changed the game and how we plan to execute these projects. I think the teams have an outstanding job. Now whether that translates into higher prices, I think the market will tell. I think we're pretty pleased with the margin and backlog that's going to come in over the several quarters. But as far as capacity, we feel good about where we are. I think the other element that I would suggest is we have seen some of projects kind of get pushed a little bit -- Shell, GTL, which we were doing some work on has obviously been postponed if not cancelled. Sasol is kind of pushed out a little bit.","So when you think my comment a couple of quarters ago, I was worried about the craft content and whether we could turn the crank and add those kind of people. I was worried then, I'm not worried now. I feel really good about our ability to attract the best and brightest globally frankly on the craft side to get these things done. So I feel pretty good about where we are. As I've said to you guys before -- I want the clients project all the time; not just on a onetime basis. So price gouging and doing those things don't make good strategic sense to me. So we're going to be comfortable that that we're getting the return we expect and so far I would suggest that we're doing quite well in adding to the value that's in our backlog from a gross margin standpoint.","Jamie Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse","Okay and then I guess just one follow-up. On the quarter while the Oil & Gas was great and I guess that's all that people care about. If you backed out the gains that you got in Government, which I understand happened but whatever and you look at the underlying profitability of Government, the underlying profitability, the decline that you saw in Industrial, in Infrastructure and the Power business, those businesses, I feel like the profitability were below what I would have expected. Can you just talk about where the quarter on those businesses shaped out relative to your expectation? Then I'm done, sorry.","David Seaton","There is a lot of moving parts. Biggs can comment on any specifics that he cares to but I'd remind you guys that we're probably the only company in our space that's as diversified as we are from a market perspective. And if you go back a year and half ago, we're really happy about the margins coming out of Mining and the margins coming out of Industrial and Infrastructure in general; and that will return. There is a cyclical nature to our business and I think our diversity and our focus on that I think helps us over the long term provide profitable growth for our investors. So I feel really good about that strategy of diversity.","Now, with regard to the puts and takes in the quarter, I think we are pleased with where we are given those circumstances. As Biggs said in his prepared remarks, what would be considered by some when they read the data as onetime events; we don't look at that way. It's profitability that we expected in the closeout of some of those projects and how the government deals with contractors. So whereas it looks on usual, it didn't surprise us at all, given where we are. We didn't think that one of the settlements would actually come in the fourth quarter. So we're pleased it did but I think the value of the margin in backlog and all our market segments, I'm pleased with given where they are in their cycles.","But I'd also tell you that we're really focused on the cost side of the equation and I think as we go through one of the -- to answer part of the Andy's question, part of it is I think, Peter in Oil & Gas has done a really job of rightsizing their organization and readying it for this next wave.","Operator","And next we will move onto Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","David, can you update us on your expectations for final investment decision on Mozambique LNG, how is that project tracking and can you just talk about your intent to bid on the project -- should we look for a similar full fabrication cost paid that you delivered on Kitimat.","David Seaton","Yes. We have submitted our technical proposal in March, which is followed up I think in six weeks with a priced proposal. I'm not exactly sure. It's close there behind. And then they will go into a quite mode and evaluate which ones will be their contractor. We feel good about how we worked with the customer. We feel good about the offering that we've got. We're really pleased with our partner JGC and how they are helping us and how we are helping them. So we will see, but I think any decision is probably late year, and we'll see where it goes from there.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","And David, just to clarify the decision by end of year, do you need a final investment position or down select how the process will play out?","David Seaton","You'd probably have to ask Anadarko. I mean I know that they've extended some of the delivery dates in the past. I think that we are going to stick with the plan and they make a down select decision in late this year and there never was a final FID in '14. I don't believe. So I think the final, final is sometime next year.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","And U.S. infrastructure opportunities, can you give us an update how the opportunities set for Fluor bookings over the next 12 to 18 months based on major projects that you are evaluating?","David Seaton","While we have had several -- a lot of proposal activities at this second place over the last little bit, waiting on several programs. I think we're kind of in a lull, to be honest with you. I think that the public-private partnership approach is gaining speed in the United States and I think we've got a distinct advantage in that. I think state laws are having to look at how they allow that because not all states allow for a public-private partnership approach. But I also think a lot of the states have been involved in but what Governor Cuomo has done in New York with Tappan Zee. He moved that forward at breakneck speed, and I think with all of the issues that the U.S. infrastructure is facing, we got to do something. And the governments can't afford it. So I think that PPP market is going to be the approach of choice.","And as I said, I don't know if anybody does it any better than we do. So I feel pretty good about that market in the next - I think that's got a lot longer tail on it than the Oil & Gas Sector, frankly, because some of those programs are going to be very large and the gestation period is going to be prolonged. So I think, I go back to my diversification comment. When you get to 16-17-18, I think there's going to be some really faster moves on the infrastructure front.","Operator","And from Vertical Research we will hear from Brian Konigsberg.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research","David, actually just going back to Oil & Gas. I, mean its clear your enthusiasm for the project pipeline, but I guess just curious about just general discussions with project owners. We have been obviously hearing about pressures on operating cash flows and decision making on deployment of capital, whether they proceed with projects that are on the board today, or do pay dividends are buyback stock or other avenues of allocation. I mean are you using any type of pressure on kind of the large projects in the pipeline at all, or is it kind of smooth sailing and there has just been a lot of overreaction to that in the market.","David Seaton","Well I think that the companies are doing what they think, what they thinks right and you probably -- I'm not -- that's above my pay grade to practices on their practices but we really have not seen a whole lot of change recently. And let me put some color on that. We have seen some change going back probably three years ago where a little more diligence taking place by the project teams, the projects are getting so large that you know they're going through one more quarter for FID funding, they're going for one more review with their boards, get'em out is different than that.","So I think there is more scrutiny, but I don't think it is any different today than it was two years ago. I think that we haven't seen anybody other than Shell cancel a project of any significance. But I think they are just rationalizing where they are going to spin their money. I wouldn't say that it's any different, but also wouldn't say its smooth sailing. When these guys are deciding to spend, you pick the number $12 billion $15 billion $18 billion on a project; a lot of people take a big swallow and ask for more information. So I think that's what's happening, but I wouldn't say there's any different than it's been for the last two years.","And also there is no difference in what the mining guys are doing because I think what we are seeing the mining guys dusting off some of these projects again and looking at some rationalizations that we have seen taken place with different cancellations. But I don't think that you have seen a really pull back on fall back on the developments that are going to put ore in the water and that's what they get paid to do and we're going to help them.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research","","Well actually that was kind of my next question, just on the mining side. So you have been -- I guess I'm always saying there saying that we will see the return of some of these projects and there's been some more commentary about copper project, specifically kind of the shortage that might be emerging on that front. Maybe just talk about, are you seeing something that could potentially hit in '14 or is this more '15 type of development and how substantial\u2026..","David Seaton","","\u2026it's a lot of steady work. Rather certain projects come back in the same scope that they were is questionable so is probably some rescoping and some additional front end engineering and technology selection work to be done. So I'm not looking for any big stuff in '14 but I am looking for growth as we get into '15.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research","","And can you please sneak one last in Biggs, I just noticed that the shareholders equity is down sequentially [indiscernible] -know earnings in the quarter. Is that just a reflection of the backlog removal or are there other items playing in there.","David Seaton","","No the backlog removal wouldn't affect the shareholders' equity other than earnings. You've got other comprehensive income and you've got the share repurchases.","Operator","","And we'll move on to Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS","","Wondering if you still assume a typical, call it 4% to 5% margin in the government business for 2014. And I assume the other proposal costs that you mentioned were the reason for the kind of sub 2% margins excluding the $57 million and I guess as it relates to the margin assumptions, I know you kept the overall $410 million to $460 million guidance unchanged, but was there anything notable that shifted around within that expectation for the year since October 31st.","David Seaton","","Your last question first. I don't think there's anything real notable that would be shifting around and on the Government group; yes, you're right. I think that the margin expectation between 4% to 5% is a reasonable one for 2014. The 2013 fourth quarter did have that offsetting effect of the higher than normal proposal costs and also some increases, otherwise an overhead which wouldn't necessarily be recurring. So those two things had some degree of offsetting the $57 million.","And I'll just reinforce something there, that $57 million - we started out looking at the fourth quarter and gave original guidance. We did assume there would be some benefit there. We just didn't assume there was going to be a full $57 million. And it really is in nature similar to what we have in other periods and that's because there's some government groups margins to bounce around on a recurring basis anyway. In this case it's just a lot of it hitting in the fourth quarter and it happened at different times, kind of reinforcing the notion there and the fact that these probably were three separate items. It's just unusual to have them all happening in one quarter. So I'd be reluctant to you know throw it all together in one $57 million number and treat it as a singular, absolutely distinct kind of a event.","Steven Fisher - UBS","","Okay that's helpful. And then maybe David, digging in a little bit more on the fixed price mix in Oil & Gas, if you could talk a little bit more about, the basis of your confidence and the ability to price it appropriately; is it -- maybe this time around you're doing more engineering, getting that more completed before you actually start the construction or is it, your approach to construction with more modular. What's the sort of the basis for the confidence in that, sort of the pricing of that risk?","David Seaton","","Well I mean I think it's all of the above. As I said we've taken a lot of time going back three years from a project that we lost spectacularly in the Middle East and kind of did a ground up review of how we're doing projects, how we estimate things, what is in our designs, what does it take to make sure we can mitigate the risk of construction is that fabrication and I think all of the above have led to us being, I think a lot more competitive in the marketplace which I hope translates into higher margin.","But I think I've got great confidence in how we kind of retooled the system and that system is in its entirety, the designs that we're using, how we're applying our supply chain expertise, where we're buying things, how we're buying things, the partners that we choose to work with and how we're going to execute the project in a much more efficient manner. I think what we're trying to focus on is a better delivery of both cost and schedule to our customers and I think my confidence in this will lead to I think additional awards because we're going to be able to do it better than anybody else and that's what we are focused on.","So, I know that sounds like motherhood and apple pie here but I forgot to tell you what the teams have done in deleveraging. As an example the Oil & Gas guys leveraging the expertise from a power group. 100% of that backlog is lump sum and leveraging the logistical capabilities of some of the infrastructure projects and taking the lessons learned from that. What we have done on direct-hire construction and large step of what we have done to secure our position with fabricated modules, all of that goes into us, I think having a much more competitive offering with much more surety of execution.","Operator","","And from Stephens Investments we will go to Will Gabrielski. ","Will Gabrielski - Stephens","","Can I push a little more on Oil & Gas margins. And I am just counting it's been three years since you were last over four and now you are back over four, but it sounds like you have the conviction that you are going to get, another 90 bps or so between now and year end into that margin. And I'm just curious, is it an accelerating burn associated with the big wins you had last year or is it something around the cost side or a combination of both that gives you some at least comfort that\/or trending that direction?","David Seaton","","I think it's both, I mean I think it's both. What we are seeing is the payoff of the investments that I just mentioned. It's effective utilization of our resources. It's the deployment of the results of the strategies around expanding our offerings both in terms of market and in geography. I think what the team has done is really open the aperture of the market without risking the risk profile of the project and with that come some efficiencies. So, we are seeing improved margins in backlog and part of that's because of how we have developed the strategies to deploy and execute its additional leverage from the use of, utilization sorry, utilization of the people we have.","But it's all the above. i mean I think we are starting as a company; not just Oil & Gas, I think we are starting to click on oil cylinders and that gives me great confidence in saying that yes, we are going to put more margin over the next three quarters on the books for Oil & Gas. And I think you are going to see the overall margin improve for the bigger Fluor. So I hope I'm not too overly optimistic or sound too overly optimistic on the phone but there is a lot of good things to be talked about with where we're headed and the successes that we are having.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens","","Okay. Was the North West upgrade also a lump sum EPC win?","David Seaton","","No.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens","","When you talked about Mozambique LNG or when you think about Anadarko, I guess that you are doing the feed for, how is the timing of that project shift if Anadarko wasn't involved there, if there's in ownership, is that something that you think about in terms of FID targets and getting the EPC nod?","David Seaton","Well I don't have any indication that they are looking to parleys with that project. Obviously if I did, there would be a delay, because there is not anybody working in the lease to pick that up but we haven't gotten any indication that a significant change is eminent.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens","","Okay. Then lastly if you don't mind just on NuScale, I am just curious where, one, where do you think the organic Power margin is in \u201814, if you want to comment on that and two, where are you on the pursuing strategic alternatives or looking for partners and how much of that is embedded in the guide at this point?","David Seaton","","There's two questions there. I think the margin question was around power in general, without NuScale. Is that right? ","Will Gabrielski - Stephens","Yes, that's the first part.","David Seaton","","I mean I think that that's a very competitive market right now and I don't foresee us getting back into double-digit margins anytime soon with regard to Power. However I do think we are going to see some improvement as we move into '14. We've got a lot of projects that have been bid and we are in the negotiation stages of as we speak. Whether we win or not is yet to be seen, but I have confidence in growth in Power overall and improving the margin sum in that segment during \u201814.","With regard to NuScale, we're still in the negotiation process with Department of Energy, on exactly what that sharing looks like. So, it's hard for me to really predict what the expenditures will be; but what I committed to you guys in the last quarter I maintain and that is that Fluor's investment will not be what it was in '13. And what that exactly means, I can't tell you right now but I can tell you when in FOA, it was that good housekeeping seal of approval that we needed to attract interest from investors. There's a lot of dialog with certain investors that we're in other less definitive dialogs before FOA but until the ink's dry on the FOA, it's hard for me to say who is ready to write a check or become an owner. But I can tell you that there is a lot of interest from partners, both in terms of technology owners and power companies and a significant interest in some of the suppliers for the equipment that will be required to build those facilities.","So we're a little bit behind what I hoped would be, but A, as I said in the prepared remarks, I think it was validation that the DOE selected only NuScale, and I think that that was what we needed to get the dialog and interest from potential investors to the table.","Biggs Porter","I'll elaborate just a little bit on with the math on NuScale. As David said we're still on negotiation on FOA arrangements so there is some things to be full defined but generally talking about FOA a word of just over $200 million which would be over 4 year period, so that's about $50 million a year that would come from the government as a match. So our corresponding spend would be $50 million. Now having said that, plug in $50 million for this year for NuScale in our outlook and our guidance, because they will be influenced by two things, one is how much pull back there is, which is one of the things that gets negotiation, how far back the past we effectively get some degree of match for. And secondly, what happens from a standpoint of selling down our interest. Until we're done with the negotiation, until we're able to come and just how successful we\u2019re going to be, how fast in selling down the interest, it's hard to be finite as to what the expectation is for NuScale for the year. But that helps to figure out kind of what ceiling is and it's a little down also.","Will Gabrielski - Stephens","It does, thank you Biggs.","Operator","And next we'll hear from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael Dudas - Sterne Agee","","I don't know what law there is in infrastructure we can fill in all these potholes around New York City, beat the numbers.","Biggs Porter","We'll just stick bridges.","Michael Dudas - Sterne Agee","You picked the right one over here of course. So my question is relative to again law in infrastructure like the government, mining and et cetera looking at INI. Is there opportunities for Fluor to make some acquisitions to fill in some holes or skill sets or technologies winning that broad scope in 2014? Seems like you may be fairly generous with the share repurchase and dividends or it could be enough capital to show some opportunities there. So just wanted your thoughts on that.","David Seaton","Well I think what we have always told you is that, if there is not any strategic reason for the cash returning it to shareholders through dividend and share repurchases is the next usage. I think that hopefully the increase in the dividend shows you the confidence we have in our earnings streams over the next few years and also kind of recharging the repurchase program also shows that we have got an expectation of cash generation there. But I can tell you that does not hamper us from looking at niche acquisitions.","As I have said in the past it's hard to move the needle for us because of our diversity and we're going to be very careful in how we look at acquisitional growth. But I do believe that some level of acquisition over the next couple of years is needed to fill some skill gaps. But I can commit to you that we're going to be very careful in how we look at that and what pieces that we get. I think that I go back some of the other terms we have used around like niche to describe those acquisitions, and I think we'll stick with that.","Michael Dudas - Sterne Agee","I appreciate that. And my follow up is David maybe with the recent reorganization internally promoting Peter to the COO. What's the vision behind that and are there -- is there opportunities for more cost saving streamline opportunities or more or area to kind of focus on getting better and deeper penetration with the current client base.","David Seaton","I appreciate that question, we really flattened the organization so that we could be more nimble and agile with our customer base, we eliminated a layer of management basically so that both Peter and I can spend more time with the projects and with the customers. Clearly, there is a benefit from an overhead reduction, from the elimination of positions. But really Peter and I looked at the commercial side of the business. Now government still is a direct report to me but when you look at the commercial business looking for the synergies, looking for cost optimization as I mentioned when we're talking about lump sum some of it is becoming much more cost competitive in how we deploy our resources, no duplication of efforts. So this was an opportunity for us to really get ready for the wave that's in front of us and I'm really pleased that Peter took that position. But I think what I really like is it created a lot of opportunity for the next wave of leadership in this corporation. And I think from a long term perspective it gives me great confidence that we're here for long term, I'm certainly here for the long term. But I'd tell you I am really excited about this change and the effect it's going to have on how competitive we can be.","","Operator","And next we'll move on to Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Yes. Hi, thanks for taking my question. David I just wanted to get a sense of how you're thinking about the guidance for the full year what are the puts and takes ongoing to the upfront or the lower end of the range and whether this government resolution was included in your 2014 guidance?","David Seaton","As I've said before I'm not going to give guidance within guidance. I think we're comfortable with maintaining that guidance as I think the question the last quarter was how confident are you that you can stay in that range if you don't win either the LNG plants. We've won the one that we wanted because it starts early. So it gives confidence that we're within the range and right on target with what we expect from an internal earnings target perspective.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Great, I appreciate that. And then just within I&I segment do you think about the profitability of that segment at this low run rate of revenues? Are we still looking at a 3% to 4% margin number for this year or is that going to be difficult to achieve?","Biggs Porter","On I&I the run rate going into the third quarter was 4% little above that it jumped up in the third quarter there is also some significant milestones and favorable events so we said wouldn't necessarily repeat themselves and then it would fall back down to that 4% or just above 4% kind of level going forward and I think that's still our expectation. Keeping in mind that yes there is the mining activity is lower margin business infrastructure is higher margin on average but does get driven somewhat by the timing of our hitting milestones and significant events which enable favorable profit pickups. And we don't necessarily see quite as much opportunity in 2014 as within '15 so that's why we'd say even though mining is going down but still fly going to be in that 4% or just above 4% kind of territory for I&I.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Thank you.","Operator","And from Macquarie we'll go to Sameer Rathod.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","Hi. How are you? Couple of questions here, first it seems like more and more of your large projects are being went under a joint venture structure. How do we think about Fluor's profitability and cash flow with an increasing non-controlling interest deduction on both income stable and cash flow?","David Seaton","Well, predominantly the joint ventures are accounted for on a partial consolidation basis. So it pick up our share of revenues, it pick up our share of profitability and therefore the margin rate really is not affected by the fact that it's a joint venture versus just something that we have and that we're the sole prime contractor on. From the standpoint of cash flow likewise we're picking up our fair share of the cash flows and nothing because it's consolidated, it really doesn't affect non-controlling interest at all because we're speaking up our shares those who picking up the 100% and they're going to back out in non-controlling interest. So for the most part it should fairly transparent or no real distortion occurring in margins in respect of the P&L.","Cash flow can be somewhat affected by virtue of cash builds the joint venture than we're all having agree about how we take cash out and that's why when we look at cash availability we first think, first thing we look to exclude is the cash that's tied up in joint ventures or in advances from customers because that's really represent something that is immediately available but over an extended period of time that is, it's just a matter of we're not the sole determinant of when the cash gets flowed back to the joint ventures.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","Okay, that's very helpful. I guess my next question is if I think about your prospect list I think a lot of these mergers LNG or natural gas like projects in some way dependent on emerging market growth and given the recent volatility and enhance the number of unexpected rate hikes, it seems like global GDP rates is about 10% of the world's GDP just saw big a hike, how do evaluate some of these larger projects in that context and I guess how do you handicap the funding of these projects given that liquidity has been drained from the market? Thank you.","David Seaton","That's a great question. I think our view into that I mean obviously I look at - we look it is kind of trends and market conditions when we're doing our plans. But I think the best granularity comes from when we have our conversations with the customers on maybe these programs and I think fit them at the great example where they seen the hikes because that product has headed to Asia and they're on tract to continue funding.","So I think the challenge that we have and this is something we spent a lot of time on is which projects are we going to chase and use that selectively or create the selectivity based on where we think these programs are going. And so far, I think, we've made wise choices of where we invest our money in terms of proposals and efforts to get positions for these projects. So I don't see any macroeconomic issues or product flows changing anything that we're really looking right now through '14.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alex Rygiel with FBR.","Alex Rygiel - FBR","David or Biggs, as it relates to your buy back activity, you've obviously bought back 200 million in the fourth quarter and that was at the lower end of your range of sort of 200 to 400 but yet in the first quarter of this year it appears if you're on your way to buying back another 200 million, so as we think about your buy backs should we think about it as a sort of 200 million a year sort of a strategy or is it a 400 million a year sort of strategy?","Biggs Porter","Well, I guess to clarify kind of back to 200 million to 400 million when we said that, we said it'd be over the next several months as opposed to in the fourth quarter. So we really are executing right in alignment and going to the higher level of 400 million and it's been accomplished over the fourth quarter last year, first quarter of this year. From the standpoint of how to think about it, as David already said, it always depends upon is there other higher better use of cash or is there anything else that we can get a greater return on. We always have to look at that and for that reason because you can't always predict those in advance, it's hard to say, here's what the expectations should be.","And having said that, I think if you look back over the last few years it's been around $400 million a year on average even after considering the lower level last year it was around 400 in 2012 and it was above that in 2012. So it's averaged around 400 million but it's always going to be dependent upon, it could be higher or lower depending upon the combination of fastest generator and what the other alternatives are if there are any. But we did increase within rate to increase the cash distributed to shareholders through a different meaning.","Alex Rygiel - FBR","That's great, helpful. And then secondly as it relates to LOGCAP IV, is sort of the outlook for 2014 still around 1 billion in revenue?","Biggs Porter","Yes.","Alex Rygiel - FBR","And how's your methodology for accounting for LOGCAP IV in backlog changed?","Biggs Porter","Not a LOGCAP IV, no, that wasn't effected anyway.","Alex Rygiel - FBR","Perfect. Thank you, nice quarter.","Operator","The next we'll hear from Andrew Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew Wittmann - Baird","I just had a question on the non-controlling interest line that looks sequentially it's done descent amount just kind of wanted to know is there a project behind that potentially maybe the mining joint venture but maybe something else?","Biggs Porter","Yes, so, I'm glad you asked, it really is a good follow-on question to the one that earlier about the new joint venture because I really answer what was going on, what the new joint ventures on the Oil & Gas side. I said we anticipate being partial consolidation but we did have on the mining side one project last year which caused non-controlling interest to go up and that was in fact Pascua Lama. You may recall back at the first to last year, we took responsibility for the Argentinian side where we had just had Chilean side and when we did that it caused us to move from partial consolidation on that project to full consolidation within that non-controlling interest. But now that work has first wound down and secondly cancelled at least for the timing being then that reduces now the non-controlling interest we're going to have out of the mining business.","Andrew Wittmann - Baird","Anything else on the go forward basis as this $18 million levels kind of the right level you think going forward? Biggs.","Biggs Porter","It's going to bounce around that's really kind of hard to project. But I think that just keep in mind that that just nets out of the bottom line and it doesn't really affect our net P&L and it doesn't even effect of taxes literally, it has a cosmetic effect on the tax rate but it doesn't affect our absolute taxes. So I understand it can create a complexity in modeling but for the most part you shouldn't speculate in a day that it is neutralized. ","Andrew Wittmann - Baird","And then one other question to some of these projects that you announced after the quarter, software larger ones like the Clean Fuels project, Kitimat. Can you talk about what scope we should be expecting and maybe specifically to the clean fuels, we noticed that is a consortium there. Should we think about your role as more of a engineering construction management rather than construction type role in that project.","David Seaton","No actually that project is based on scope. So each of us, say a vertical split scope EPC, and if you remember we did the FEED on that program so many years ago. How that project divides up is basically a third to third to third. But little early for us to put out any numbers.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen that does conclude the time that we have for our question and answer session. I'll turn the conference back over to management for any additional closing comments.","David Seaton","Thank you operator and I really appreciate everyone participating in our call this afternoon. I think our performance in 2013 was very solid, particularly given the sharp decline that we experienced in Mining and Metals. However, as I said, or Oil and Gas Power and Infrastructure and Government business have all delivered marked improvement over 2012. We continue to face headwinds as we talked about in Mining and Government, as we move into '14. But we believe that we are in and only innings of a very major oil and gas investment cycle, they were very prepared for. Importantly oil and gas segment continues to gather, I think significant momentum by delivering over 30% growth in its segment profit, capturing the clear version we mentioned and growing their backlog and positioning, I think Fluor for a substantial new award output in '14 as well as beyond. With that I really appreciate your interest and support of our company and we wish everyone a good day.","Operator","Thank you ladies and gentlemen. That does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead, Mr. Telfer.","Geoff Telfer - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, Andrew, and welcome to Fluor's second quarter 2017 conference call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer; and incoming CFO, Bruce Stanski. Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after market close, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll referenced while making prepared remarks.","But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on slide 2.

Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now, let me turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Geoff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we will review the second quarter results and discuss the outlook for 2017. Before I get started, I want to thank Biggs for his contribution to Fluor over the last five years. His expertise and strategic leadership have been instrumental in strengthening our company's financial foundation. So I'd like to thank Biggs for his service. As mentioned, Bruce Stanski is on the phone with us today. He will transition into the CFO role starting tomorrow. Bruce, I wonder if you'd like to say a few words.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Yes, David, but I'll be brief. I'm very happy to have the privilege to serve as CFO for Fluor. Biggs and his entire finance team have just been great on getting me up to speed on things. I have met a number of you at past investor events, and I do really look forward to reengaging with both the analyst and investor community.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Bruce. I want to start our call today discussing the issues we're experiencing in our Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, and specifically the concerns on three gas-fired projects currently under construction. All three projects, four if you include the Brunswick project that incurred a charge in 2015, had a fundamental problem. And the projects did not meet the original baseline assumptions due to improper estimating, craft productivity and equipment issues. All of these projects were bid in 2014 by the same pursuit team.","In addition, all four projects were based on next gen turbines or steam generators that were first of a kind for Fluor. The quality control and completeness of these turbines delivered to the site were not in line with our bid assumptions, and we are pursuing our options.","So where are we today? Of the three currently active projects, one is 92% complete with an expected mechanical completion in Q4. One is 45% complete with an estimated completion date of Q2, 2018. And the last project is 42% complete and is expected to be complete in Q4, 2018. I'd make a comment that those are construction completion percentages, not overall project percent complete. So this is specifically related to the construction scope.","I've discussed the problems, and now I'd like to talk about what we've changed. After we had the initial charge last quarter, we changed the Power leadership team and brought in Simon Nottingham as the President of that Group, of the Power Group. Simon comes from our oil and gas group, and he brings to this role his extensive background in project and program management. He and his team, in coming to this role, led a review of the three projects in the second quarter and developed a path forward that is reflected in our current estimates.","Some members of the Power management team have exited Fluor. We also informed our employees that we are closing our Charlotte office and consolidating Power operations in Greenville, where it will be closer to our other businesses and leadership.","As we do periodically with all of our markets, we're in the middle of reassessing the gas-fired power market to determine where there are opportunities for returns consistent with our expectations and long-term experience. The power market is extremely competitive. And unfortunately, we are not immune to the challenges others have seen in this segment of the power industry.","We will only participate in this market if we believe we can achieve appropriate risk-adjusted returns. Every prospect in this market is being reviewed by the team through a different set of lenses.","In addition to the changes in management at Power Group and our strategic evaluation of the gas-fired power market, we're also implementing other changes to give us greater confidence that these types of earnings adjustments are diminished and less frequent.","I'd ask you to please turn to slide 3. For the past several years, we've been focused on expanding our EPC model into the one integrated solution. We've done this by adding fabrication capacity, improving our supply chain capabilities and performing more direct-hire construction. This strategy delivers on our clients' need for greater capital efficiency, and these actions also allow us to perform greater scopes of work on a project, which gives us greater control on the project outcomes and provides us an opportunity to generate greater returns.","We are simultaneously executing over 1,000 projects globally with excellence. The vast majority of the projects meet or exceed our expectations, and we see the benefits of our integrated solution strategy at work. Unfortunately, it takes a few poor performing projects to overshadow the great work we are doing on most of our projects.","Strong project execution has been a hallmark of Fluor. And as I've said, the vast majority of our projects are performing well. Strategically, we're focused on improving our execution and maintaining this key differentiator. This strategy is multipronged.","We have initiatives in place to improve safety and quality. By improving safety and quality, we'll improve project outcomes to the benefit of our clients and Fluor. We have significantly increased the independent review of critical projects. We are improving our estimating system. And we're also making significant investments in applying data analytics to projects so that we can identify challenges earlier, which would allow us to mitigate problems sooner. We believe all these actions will minimize downside risk and allow for greater upside opportunities.","From an even broader perspective, the current market environment is perhaps the worst I've seen in my 30-plus years. The market has contracted since 2014. The good news is that we're starting to see prospects come back in some of our end markets including mining, which includes the Anglo American Quellaveco project in Peru and the Salares Norte project in Chile for Gold Fields, and our recent announcement of the BHP South Flank project. Having said that, creating and maintaining a diverse portfolio of work has been and continues to be a core strategy of Fluor.","Portfolio diversity helps minimize adverse impacts from a specific industry, as well as industry cycle \u2013 excuse me \u2013 regional cycle. Recently, our ability to expand our backlog in infrastructure, government, life sciences and advanced manufacturing has offset multiyear decline in mining and metals as well as oil and gas. In addition, we have expanded our long-term recurring revenue opportunity with our acquisition of Stork along with key wins in our government business. Our integrated solutions, project execution and portfolio diversity strategies create a strong sustainable company that is built to preserve -- persevere in the current market situation and build for future profitable growth.","Now let's look at the second quarter and please turn to slide number 4. The net loss attributable to Fluor was $24 million or $0.17 per diluted share. This includes the $124 million or $0.89 per diluted share charge related to those power projects I discussed. Consolidated segment profit for the second quarter was $15 million. Segment profit margins were point zero \u2013 sorry \u2013 0.3% compared to 4.7% last year. Excluding the negative impacts of the project charges taken this quarter, segment profit margin would have been approximately 4.3%. Revenue for the quarter was $4.7 billion compared to $4.9 billion a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $3.2 billion, and ending backlog was $37.6 billion.","Turning to slide 5. The Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $860 million of new awards for the quarter, and their ending backlog was $19 billion. Of this amount, approximately $1.2 billion is in mining. Now we continue to have positive conversations with clients and see some sizable EPC awards over the next two quarters. Our oil and gas customers have become accustomed to the current range of crude oil prices, but they are moving forward with CapEx spending, but with a focus on advantaged projects.","Our integrated solutions offering is being received well. And while projects have shifted to the right, there's \u2013 they're still there for us to win. Second quarter new awards for Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were $672 million, including the Southern Gateway highway project in Texas. Ending backlog was $11.4 billion for this segment, which also reflects an adjustment for the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station project that is winding down. So that is no longer in our backlog. Both SCANA and Santee Cooper are starting the process to abandon both units at that location. And we are working with them to assist in the orderly and safe closure of those sites. We continue to support and progress at Southern as they wrap up their assessment efforts for that site, and we expect that assessment to be done in the next four weeks or so.","Turning to slide 6. The Government group posted second quarter new awards of $1.1 billion, including our annual renewal of task order awards for LOGCAP IV in Afghanistan and additional funding for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and the Idaho Cleanup Project Core Contract. Ending backlog was $4.1 billion. The Diversified Services segment posted second quarter awards of $554 million. Ending backlog was $2.9 billion.","And now I'd like to turn it over to Biggs. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 7 of the presentation. As usual, I'll start by providing some additional comments on our second quarter performance and move to the balance sheet. Revenue for the quarter was $4.7 billion, down slightly from $4.9 billion a year ago. Revenue increases from Government and Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were offset by decline in Energy, Chemicals & Mining. Corporate G&A expenses for the second quarter were $47 million compared with $53 million a year ago. Expenses for the quarter include $14 million related to foreign exchange fluctuations, partially offset by a decrease in compensation expense.","This quarter's loss per diluted share of $0.17 includes an $0.89 charge on three power projects in the Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment. Without this charge, earnings per share would have been well within our expectations for the quarter. Margins for the quarter were 0.3% compared to 4.7% a year ago. Margins at our Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment improved to 5.5% from 3.8% last quarter and 5.1% a year ago. This improvement was driven by increased project execution activities and cost improvements for large international projects.","Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2.1 billion compared to $2.2 billion last quarter and $1.9 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $158 million for the quarter, as we continue to see an improvement in working capital. This represents an improvement from last quarter that positions us well for the remainder of 2017. During the quarter, we paid $29 million in dividends.","Moving to slide 8. Excuse me. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $37.6 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 32%. At quarter end, the mix by geography was 48% U.S. and 52% non-U.S. I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2017, which is on slide 9. We are revising our earnings guidance to a range of $1.40 to $1.70 per diluted share, to primarily reflect the charges taken on power projects this quarter and to a smaller extent the wind-down of the V.C. Summer Nuclear Station project.","Our guidance for 2017 also assumes G&A expense in the range of $180 million to $200 million, and a tax rate for the remaining quarters of 32% to 34%. Other expectations for 2017 include NuScale expenses of approximately $80 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $225 million to $275 million depending on AMECO opportunities. Looking at margin expectations for the balance of the year, we anticipate the Energy, Chemicals & Mining group to be approximately 5%, Diversified Services to be approximately 5.5%; and Industrial, Infrastructure & Power excluding NuScale, and Government, both to be approximately 3%.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Our first question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good evening. I guess a couple questions, David, I appreciate the color on the projects, the three power projects. But can you give us some sense of the backlog what percent of the backlog is problem projects at this point? Because we had issues with CPChem and the infrastructure projects. So I'm just trying to think that part through?","The second question is if I look at your guidance cut from before, you're reducing your guidance $0.95 at the midpoint and the three power projects were like $0.90. So I'm just wondering if that's conservative enough in particular with the cancellation of the nuke project.","And then my last bigger question is, David, I appreciate the management changes and closing offices and considering whether or not you should be in the fixed-price power business. But the fixed \u2013 the issue is much broader than power, when we think about CPChem, when we think about infrastructure, when we just think about the history. So why is it ever a good idea to do fixed price work, we never had a better mousetrap, not you or anyone?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, those are good questions. I'm not going to get into what's in the backlog and what we feel on those backlog projects. But I will address the fixed-price work. I \u2013 we continue to develop our confidence in that market. Part of it is reliant on our ability to deploy our resources. In each of these cases including CPChem, we were challenged by available skilled labor on those job sites as well as mistakes that were made in certain areas.","With regard to the power projects, I didn't say we wouldn't do fixed priced power projects again. I said we were going to review the gas-fired power projects to see whether that piece of the market is consistent with what we expect. I appreciate that your confidence has been shaken, but I will argue that this is not systemic. In the case of those four projects, they were done by the same team, by the same \u2013 using the same statistics and information. And unfortunately, I think those in our industry would agree, you really don't know where the issues are going to raise their heads until you're at about 40%, 30% to 40% construction progress.","On power projects just like on CPChem critical path runs through the piping account, and in all of those cases. In Power, we miss things. In the case of a CPChem, we've been very transparent with you guys in terms of the things that led to that write-down, most of which was outside of our \u2013 some of which was outside of our control. I don't want to overstate that. So I don't think that even though we've got a dismal report here, obviously frustration in the outcome of those four projects, I would argue that the things that we've done, the changes we've made, the people we've got looking at these programs and projects give me greater confidence that we can perform as we expect.","So I don't necessarily agree that \u2013 and I may be putting words in your mouth, that we have a systemic problem with the fixed-price projects.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","But David, since Q2, we've announced like \u2013 over $2 in problem projects?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I understand that.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And then just to the guidance, if we look at your guidance kind of at the midpoint, it's $0.95. The power projects are $0.90-some. Just hope that doesn't seem conservative enough? And then also Biggs, may be a comment on the cash flow with problem projects? And I'll get back in queue.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Yes. So on the guidance, you're right. Last quarter, we set guidance that we felt like was a conservative level. Obviously when we did that, we weren't anticipating these particular project charges. They really fell outside of what we were considering, as I say, in that guidance. Nonetheless, it was conservative with respect to everything else that we saw. And so by taking down guidance now for the $0.89 plus a net $0.06 in the middle of the range for the effects of Summer and all these other variables, we think that we're left with a relatively conservative posture with respect to everything else for the remaining six months of the year.","So we feel comfortable with what we've reset it to, don't think it needs to go any further. We've tightened our range on the basis that we're now six months through the year, so the degree of variability on new book and burn and other things is \u2013 should be down for the rest of the year. But that's really what drives our primary uncertainty of the range. What might take us to the top versus the bottom will largely be varied upon the rate at which we get new work in. We see new book and burn on the way. The question is, is it going to come in time to fully affect 2017 or does some of it fall over into 2018. And on that basis then, we have a range.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And sorry, cash...","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","(22:32)","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Plus or minus.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Cash flow for the year if any?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, on cash, we've done well through the first half. The projects certainly will use cash and not generate for remainder of their project lives. But having said that, we think we're in a reasonable position to hold on to the positive working capital movement that we've had year-to-date. There will be fluctuation. We don't guide on cash. So it will bounce around month to month and quarter to quarter. But I do not think that the lost projects will significantly interrupt what our expectations were for the year.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Let me make another comment and a little bit more color on where I was going. We have \u2013 we do review all these big projects on a routine basis. And we do have cold eyes or different lenses that look at them. And we do have significantly large other lump-sum projects in our backlog that are performing at or above our expectations. I'd also remind the group that after we took the CPChem write-down, it has not had a tail to it. And we are on schedule to complete that job as we'd planned.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks. I'll get back in queue.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hello.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","David, so last quarter you mentioned you did expect to win some larger EC&M projects in 2Q and 3Q particularly in mining. Obviously (24:17) seemed to delay oil and gas FIDs, you kind of talked about that in the prepared remarks. But you did announce some mining work yesterday. And the question that I would have for you is have you started to see some movement on projects, and do you still see second half 2017 backlog moving higher from here?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I do, specifically for mining. We've had a few awards after the quarter closed in E&C that will help. But some of those projects are still moving to the right in 2017. But we're still in great position to win those projects, and I'm confident that when they reach final FID, we'll move forward. But we're just seeing delays in terms of making those FID decisions in the oil and gas sector.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then just following up on Jamie's commentary, like I would agree that comp (25:18) projects for Fluor are not systemic. But I would also \u2013 I would focus on power for a second. And, David, you've been at Fluor for a long time; when you look at the power business, rarely has it been a highlight and a lot of times it hasn't even been a positive, David. So, maybe you can talk about that. I know you talk about (25:38) in power, but how confident are you that these big changes can make power contribute like EC&M does or like the government business does? How do you get power up to standards, I guess, for Fluor?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, historically, it has provided good profitability for us. I mean, Oak Grove, LCRA, I mean, I can list dozens of projects that have been very positive. But your point is well taken. In the aggregate, it drops pretty dramatically when you write off three projects like this. So I understand your point.","I think the other comment I'd make is that the power market is basically 100% \u2013 or not 100%, 90% fixed price. And we do have a good position in that and we do have great resources that are executing with excellence. It's just a situation where I think we had a team that made some serious mistakes on four projects that all hit at one time, particularly when we bring in a new management team and they look at what they've been given.","So I think we've got some work to do in terms of what that is. But I would also, I think to your point, very few of our competitors have made their expected profitability on gas-fired power plants. And I would argue that our customers believe in a certain cost per kilowatt that does not exist. So I think that everybody in the industry needs to kind of sharpen their pencil and look at this market through a different set of lenses.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's fair. And Fluor has a relatively significant footprint in Russia in EC&M. As you know, sanctions have continued to get tighter here. Do you see any risk of \u2013 on a couple of awarded (27:41) projects either getting delayed or even getting canceled, how should we think about that going forward?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I'm sorry, Andy. You were really garbled in the beginning of that question. I didn't catch the first part.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Yeah. So I was just asking about your significant footprint in Russia in EC&M, projects like TCO obviously is in Kazakhstan. You've been (28:03) before. So how do we think about the exposure going forward given increasing sanctions? Do we need to worry about that? Or have you talked to your customers around that?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","That's a great question. I would argue that today's rhetoric and sanctions and kerfuffles from a trade perspective are no different than they've been in the entirety of my career. The things that we're doing in Russia are not party to the sanctions because we're obviously not going to do those things. So it really hadn't impacted the work we're doing. TCO is obviously a very large project that we're really focused on.","In Kazakhstan, as you said, I really don't see anything relative to sanctions impinging upon that execution. But you know I mean, this is not a -- this is a common occurrence for us. I mean, we look at these sanctions that different countries provide. And all the Saber has been rattled a little bit with Russia and China, and obviously some other places. We really don't see it impacting the projects that we see in front of us in terms of going forward or necessarily, the projects that are under execution. So I \u2013 it's much ado about nothing right now for us.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thank you, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steve Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hello, Steve.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, David. On the nuclear projects, can you talk about the tail of the wind-down there, I mean, is there revenue and cost, or just cost that you're going to be incurring? And what's the path for getting paid the $73 million as of June 30 on the receivables that you have there and how much of that changed at the end of the quarter?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","You know, from an account receivables standpoint, we'll get paid everything we're owed. I'm not concerned about that at all based on...","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Is that directly from the customer or from Westinghouse through the bankruptcy process?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I'm not sure I want to get into who, but I know from conversations I've had, and also from the fact that we have liens on those properties, that those companies are going to want to clear after comps that we'll recover that. On the wind-down, it will -- I mean our contract is continuing on with SCANA. Obviously, we've had a significant decrease in volume there. And we did recognize not only the backlog, but also the earnings hit of earnings going forward on V.C. Summer in our current guidance.","The hell of it is I don't think these projects needed to be canceled if people had done what they should have done originally. Basically, you've got one \u2013 Summer, you've already got 1 reactor set, another one sitting on site. But I appreciate the financial realities that Santee Cooper was in as well as the result that SCANA ended up in. But we'll continue to help them there, great relationship with the customer, but there will be a small tail to that over the next probably two quarters as we -- as I said in the prepared remarks, safely and efficiently shutdown that site.","On Southern, they -- we participated in different presentations with them last week as well as meetings this week about what their prospects are. I would argue that they're in different position, Southern and their partners than SCANA and Santee Cooper. But we'll see. They're going to be making their decision over the next month. We've got again a great relationship there and we're actually making good progress on that site. And if it goes forward, I would hope that we would maintain the scope that we've got right now.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And can you \u2013 since you talked about these mining awards, can you just maybe give us the aggregate size of what you have in hand or what's on the way, and if you're expecting backlog growth in the second half for the company overall, I don't know if you can confirm that, what does that tell you about directional potential for earnings next year, excluding all the charges of 2017?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, on mining specifically. All we've taken in the backlog on the two major projects that I mentioned is the early work. So there is large second piece of the scope awards and were going to backlog in the probably in the third quarter and fourth quarter of this year. So I think that those projects will help us maintain backlog at its current level. The real question is at what point do some of these oil and gas customers finally pull the trigger? As we've said, there are several large projects out there that we are bidding or participating in.","And as I mentioned one, which I won't talk about yet, but one has passed the FID process. So engineering services and the revenues and not being that big, but the revenues and profitability associated with that early design and EPs of the equation will start to burn in back half of the year for that. So we've got some work to do, but I think that as that impacts 2018, it's a little early to tell. And the reason I'm hedging my bet is because as you've seen, these projects have moved to the right on the scale. And we have hope and we believe we know where it is, but again, we've seen a fickle market in terms of making these final decisions.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Understood. Thanks, David.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thanks a lot. So maybe we can talk about something positive, David, and lighten up the mood a bit.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Tahira, that would be a very welcome thing.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Good. So I know we've been tracking some of the oil and gas customers you have. And it seems like while some of the stuff as you said is pushing to the right, the fundamental economics and demand supply behind those remain fairly intact. I know in the last quarter you really looked at petrochem as really being the place where you expect to see the more near-term activity over there, followed \u2013 and you're still a little hesitant on LNG. I would love to get a sense if that's still the ordering and if you've see some positive movements around the LNG side in particular?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yes, I think petrochemicals and refining as well are things that will go first. I don't see upstream spending a whole lot of money in the industry as we finish this year. But I do think there are some large upstream developments that are kind of being dusted off by our customers because they're in a need of that capacity. So I think as we get into 2018, 2019, we'll start to see upstream spend a little bit more than they're spending now. And that comment, excludes LNG. I think there's going to be a lot of study work on LNG, but I really don't think there's going to be a lot of projects go to the EPC phase this year or most of next year. So I think we're just going to have to wait and see what happens. But I do see a pretty robust slate of opportunities in refining and petrochemicals.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And other refining ones still a little in the Middle East, David, I know there was some pretty bit opportunities there. Are those still in the map?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, they're still on the map, but we're also seeing some refining programs in North America as well as more activity in Asia.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much, David.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Tahira.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hey, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","David, can you talk about how the prospect list looks for your infrastructure business? I know you've been expanding the range of jobs that you're evaluating to be smaller jobs as well. Can you just give us an update on how that potential prospect pipeline looks in the U.S. and internationally?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yes, it's growing dramatically. We've actually are starting to strengthen that organization because of the prospects we see. And it is all over the map. I mentioned the Southern Gateway project, couple of quarters ago; we announced the smaller project to North Texas. We announced the smaller project in South Carolina. So I think that we were kind of bifurcating if you will the nominal smaller projects and looking at that from the regional perspective.","And I would argue that in the United States for us, it's very robust in South Carolina, Virginia, Texas, Nevada, Colorado and Utah as well as California because California has a fair amount of light rail programs coming. And I think we're positioned to win one or two of those projects as they come out, but that's probably early next year before we see that happen.","Some of the larger programs are \u2013 we're pursuing. And it's pretty much Western Europe, the United States. We're looking in South Asia with some partners down there. But I think there's going to be a growth engine for us going forward. And we're just finishing some very large projects. The Horseshoe Project here in Dallas, very successful project and by the way, it was a lump-sum project.","So I feel pretty good about infrastructure and what's going to happen. I would caution though, the rhetoric we all hear from the press and where it emanates from, whether it's a federal government or state government. As you've heard me say, there is no such thing as a shovel-ready project.","But what I'm very eager to see is that at least the dialogue is around identifying in the United States, identifying the priorities and those priorities around toll roads, bridges, ports, airports fit well into our portfolio. And I think those things are going to bode well for us. But I believe that our infrastructure group will continue to be a bright spot in our organization and continue to add to their backlog as we go through the next probably six quarters.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And David, there's been significant capital raised by financial sponsors who are talking about potentially putting it to work in early 2018. Is that consistent with the pace of when you expect some of these projects to move forward? Are you seeing real benefit in terms of the opportunities for your business with the additional incoming capital?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I think the capital is there. I agree with you 100%. I think the problem is, you got to look at the Purple Line in Baltimore. Project passed all the hurdles environmentally, financially, everything else and then the regulatory environment slowed it down and actually stopped it for a while. So even though the capital is ready, some of the projects, I think, are at least to a point where you get to that next stage. I think the regulatory reform that the government is talking about has to come through before the timing of those things actually improve. And I'd put pipelines in that category.","If you look at pipelines that we're operating in right now, in one case it's waiting on the FERC permit and the FERC regulators aren't even seated. So no decision is being made. So I think the Achilles heel for infrastructure spend in the United States is clearly on the regulatory environment and what the administration and others can do to flatten that and improve the schedules associated.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And David, as you pointed out, you've got a number of projects that are performing well. I'm wondering if you could just talk about out of roughly $12 billion in backlog that's fixed price, can you give us a rough sense of the value of projects that you're monitoring closely that are at or below the performance threshold compared to history? Can you just give us a context? As you pointed out, we want to make sure we understand if there's a difference in the risk that was underwritten as part of the current fixed price backlog compared to what we've seen call it three-plus years ago.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, as I said, I've changed some organization, not just the power stuff. I've changed up some of the other organization and flattened it. And I can tell you that we're looking at all of our projects in making sure that we don't have issues.","I would argue that the lion's share of our lump-sum backlog is performing extremely well. And that's about as far as I really want to go with that. But we're improving our tools and systems. As I said, we've changed the review process to where there's more cold eyes review, and I feel reasonably good about where we are.","I think I'd point you back to some of my comments on these power projects. It's really contained in one segment of the power market. And as I said, all four of those projects were bid at a time when we didn't have good information on the new, first of a kind equipment, nor do we really have a good handle on the level of skill and number of craft employees that we would have available to us in some of these locations.","One of the projects in that power suite is operating extremely well. And the project team is being innovative, aggressive in terms of how they're executing, not the money associated with it. But again, I mean, I feel good about that.","In reflecting a little bit, there's not one company in our sector, segment, or whatever you want to call it that hasn't suffered some challenges and problems when markets are down, and I think that's historic. You can go back within Fluor a decade and a half ago, and we had a series of issues on embassies. So I think that people get aggressive in terms of those down markets. And I think what we've done to change the organizational structure and things, temper that dramatically, and we'll continue to do so.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome aboard, Bruce. Good luck. And, Biggs, it's been a real pleasure working with you and I hope next quarter I can listen to the conference call with you.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Thank you for the comments. It's been great to work with everybody on this call.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Terrific. David, you mentioned...","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Mike, can we talk about the Giants and forego the question you are going to ask?","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Well, I'd tell you, I wouldn't want \u2013 it will be a disappointing conversation given that we're going to be favorite to win the NFC East, but I will leave it at that.","You talked about \u2013 David, you brought in \u2013 you pretty much changed the organization and management structure. What is your expectations with all the changes? And how long do you think it's going to take to assess this power market, whether you're going to stay or go? And is that also trying to send a message to the client base that you need to like work with us a little bit here or else you guys aren't going to have any real power being built in this country over the next decade?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, let's be specific. I said we were looking at the gas-fired power market...","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Yeah. That's correct. That's what I mean.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","And we were looking at it from a Fluor perspective. No messages to anyone intended, and if they took them that way, I apologize, because we're looking at ourselves in terms of what we need to do.","I don't think it's going to take long. I think that my expectation, and I've kind of coined this phrase, is flawless personal performance, and it doesn't mean I'm looking for perfection. But what it does mean I'm looking for is accountability and execution excellence.","And we started that process when we found the problem at CPChem and we're continuing to do those reviews and make the changes necessary so that we don't have a repeat of what we've had here.","I can tell you that I get that we've dinged our credibility with you guys and we've got to rebuild that. And I can commit to you that we're going to do everything we can to regain that trust. But I don't think it's going to take long for us to kind of right the ship based on these losses and continue to perform. As I said, we perform over 1,000 projects at any given time and the vast majority of them are performing at or above our expectations. And, in this case, we had three bad apples and I'll go ahead and give Jamie her due, one was a double-dip in the apple bucket. And then we had one in infrastructure and then CPChem. I get where we are in your eyes and we've got some work to do to change that.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Do you anticipate Fluor as an organization giving \u2013 I guess, just looking to the second half of the year to kind of right, getting things set and ready to take advantage of what you anticipate as up markets, how quickly do you anticipate that we could start to see some cyclical recovery that will show up in the results going \u2013 not (48:17) 2018, but relative to where Fluor is standing today and how you've set things up and where the market is just about ready to reach out and grab this business (48:24)?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah. I think if we really start to see some of the FIDs in oil and gas in the last half of this year, I think 2018 is solid. Clearly, those things have long tails on them. So you'll start to see it build in 2018. The average project right now is a little \u2013 almost four years, three-and-a-half anyway. So I think, as you say, I think we're kind of starting to see the signs of recovery in oil and gas for basically a long tail because they've waited so long. There's so many things that they have to do just to maintain their product mix that they've delayed that they're going to have to do. And obviously, we're there to take advantage of that situation.","So I kind of think 2017 \u2013 we've given you the guidance on 2017. So I wouldn't give you any more comments on that. But I do think, as we get to 2018, 2019, 2020, we should start to see an accretive EPS.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners, LLC.","Thanks, David, for your comments. I appreciate it.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Mike. And by the way I bet you dinner that the Cowboys beat you guys twice.","Michael S.

Ward - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Hey, good evening, guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hey, Justin.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Good evening.","Justin J. Ward - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","David, I want to build off your commentary around the hesitation in the infrastructure and even the pipeline side around customers having a lack of clarity on the regulatory front. If we look at your Chemicals & Energy & Mining segment, the new awards there in the U.S. essentially screeched to a halt after election. So I'm wondering if you're seeing a similar hesitation in that segment around lack of clarity on the regulatory front as well.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I would say it's frustration. We're doing a pipeline for Spectra right now. And they've been waiting I don't know how long for the FERC permit. Well, after the election, all of the FERC commissioners were basically exited, and they haven't been repopulated.","So one of the frustrations I see, and this is kind of a political commentary, there's 2,200 \u2013 and you've read the same things I've read. There's 2,200 Senate candidates that have to \u2013 candidates have to go through Senate approval. I think the last count was 55. And you've got people like Elaine Chao in transportation. You've got Rick Perry in energy, Rex in State. These people that we know and know well are sitting there twiddling their thumbs, so to speak, because we haven't been able \u2013 the government hasn't been able to give their team.","So I think that is why you saw things screech to a halt. And I don't see a whole lot of improvement until that phenomenon is behind us and the efforts that the administration are putting forth in terms of the regulatory reform actually see light of day. A lot of good intent, a lot of good thought and strategies to people that I've talked to, including the folks I just mentioned, but until we get those things ,done you're not going to see these permits that are absolutely necessary to go forward actually awarded.","Justin J. Ward - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay. And so does that extend to the chemicals and refining piece as well. You talked about...","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Not as much.","Justin J. Ward - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","Okay.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Not as much, not as much. If you think about some of these projects, not only you have the State but you've got the Coast Guard, the Corps of Engineers, particularly on pipelines. You've got different state municipality permits you've got to get for creek and river crossings, the type of methods of construction in terms of the Department of Transportation and some of these right-of-ways follow state and federal highway systems. So there's just a lot of different moving parts there that are keeping these programs from going forward. And as I've said, I've got a great confidence that once we get those people in place that the right things are going to happen. But I can't predict Congress's performance.","Justin J. Ward - Wells Fargo Securities LLC","All right. That's helpful. Thanks very much.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Baird. Please go ahead.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Thanks. I just want to get a little bit better sense on I guess the Vogtle nuclear project. If you could tell us how much backlog is currently reflected in the backlog for Vogtle? And what maybe monthly burn rate is of that project?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, they were basically equal projects, and you saw the award we put in and divide it by two would be the answer, the simple answer to that. I'll let you do the math though. I apologize, but I'll let you do the math. And the second part of the question was what? Sorry.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","What was monthly burn rate that you're recognizing at Vogtle?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We really don't go into that. I mean...","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","I think I look at it this way. We said that when we lowered our outlook, our guidance, we were putting about $0.06 in for the net effects of Summer and everything else. So you can kind of figure that maybe the range is a little bit more than that for the impact of Summer and (54:48) but similar kind of effects, our contribution for Vogtle, but I wouldn't go so as far as to go start to make adjustments on that one. We feel pretty good about the opportunity for that one going forward.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yes. Those are completely different situations between those two customers. And we just don't give \u2013 we're not going to give individual project information. We don't just do that, and I don't really want to go down that slippery slope.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Makes sense. And you're right. The PUC made it pretty clear that it's a different project than the other one. So there was a cash flow from investing, cash outflow of about $191 million in the quarter, Biggs. Was that the second payment on your Chinese fab yard, or what was that related to?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","That's a variety of JVs. Those are more the normal operational JV. So we have the Chinese investment, $78 million still to be made. We'll see when that ultimately gets made, but it's not in our actuals to-date and it may get pushed out to the future.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. There was also a cash flow item for $350 million. It looked like maybe some sort of prepayment that showed up. And I was just wondering if that was tied with specific project or no.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","I'm not sure. There was a growth in other \u2013 you're looking at advances?","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yes, exactly.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Okay. Now once again, there's a variety in there as well, and I don't want to get into individual project ebbs and flows. There are so many. But getting advances is a good thing. We obviously strive to make that number as big as we can and stay as positive on the cash flow as we can through the life of projects. But there's nothing specific that I would want to point out in terms of project cash flows in the quarter tied to one versus another. They're going to have so many variables, so many different projects involved.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Norfleet with Alembic Global Advisors. Please go ahead.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Good evening, guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good evening.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","So, David, I'm a literally Redskins fan, but I will take your bet, same bet you gave Mike, but you've got to spot me a couple touchdowns on that.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","No, no, no, no, no, no. No points, no points.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Quickly, David, I know Fluor has done a good job over the years of diversifying the portfolio, as you mentioned, especially in areas like life sciences, environmental, and other areas. But, I mean, do you feel like you, at this point, have the scale to compete for some of these larger projects? And I guess, maybe my questions boil down to this. A lot of your competitors have been obviously pretty aggressive in the M&A side in terms of buying their way into markets. And I guess my point to you is I mean, do you feel like you have the ability to win some of these bigger government-type projects with the existing platform you have? Or do you feel like you would need to go in and acquire other companies in order to be more effective in that market?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I mean, other than Bechtel, I'm not sure who is bigger than us. And with regard to acquisitions or at least the diversification of those markets, flattery is always welcome because I think we've done a good job in creating the bandwidth to do just about anything. I think in the government segment specifically we continue to partner with key partners and we'll continue to do so to broaden that capability. In things like infrastructure and some of the other markets, there are some pieces and parts that we're probably going to need to strengthen.","But I would argue that there is very few companies with the balance sheet that we enjoy and the breadth in terms of geography and industry and people \u2013 human resource to do just about anything. So I think that some of the acquisitions that you're speaking of that people are making are interesting, but I would argue that they're going to be difficult.","Acquisitions in this market are always difficult. You're dealing with cultures. You're dealing with people. And it's not like a manufacturing facility or a manufacturing company where you can sell off one manufacturing facility that doesn't fit the new strategy. These things deal with culture and individual capabilities of scale. So we're going to continue to look at things that add to our offering. But I would say, we've already got the breadth to do just about any project that's presented to us that again meets our expectations in terms of risk and profitability.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay. Great And my last question just on V.C. Summer. David, I assume once the project winds down, it will have to be mothballed. Can you kind of walk me through the process of how that works and what role Fluor could eventually play with that?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, that's the role we're going to be playing. I mean, you've got the nuclear island that will have to be specially protected because of its NSSS qualities. That will be a fair amount of work to make sure that those pieces of equipment are protected. As I said, both reactors are on site. The other pieces of the project are less difficult to shut down. And in some cases, some of it is done. Some of the power distribution pieces are already complete. So just making sure that those are protected is the game. I believe that -- I mean, we were over 3,000 crafts on that site and we'll be at probably hundreds to help them over the next two quarters.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. Thanks a lot.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","That is all the time we have for questions. Mr. Seaton, at this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you. And thanks, everyone, for participating today. Our results for this quarter are unusual compared to what we've historically been able to deliver, albeit with the challenges that we've discussed today. I think in this case, the problems we did discussed are unique to one business group at a specific point in time. As far as what we see going forward for the remainder of '17 and into '18, we continue to see interest in our integrated solutions model, and we see green shoots in terms of the mining and oil and gas markets. Even with the negatives of this quarters, I do believe that we're well positioned to grow and meet the expectations of you and our many shareholders and stakeholders. We greatly appreciate your support, and we wish you a good evening.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Please go ahead.","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thanks very much, operator. Welcome, everyone, to Fluor's Second Quarter 2013 Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this morning before market open, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making our prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2 of the slide deck. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today, and in the company's 10-K.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO.","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken, and good morning to everyone and I appreciate everyone joining us this morning. Today, we'll be reviewing our results for the second quarter and discussing trends we see for the remainder of 2013.","Now if you turn to Slide 3, I'd like to begin by covering some of the highlights of our second quarter financial performance. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the quarter were $161 million or $0.98 per diluted share. I think this represents a good quarterly result when you consider the EPS was impacted by a $0.07 charge for the resolution of the last of the company's outstanding recorded claims. Otherwise, we met our expectations for the quarter.","Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $288 million, which was comparable to $287 million a year ago. Segment profit results were driven by strong growth in Oil & Gas, as well as growth in Power. These improvements were largely offset by the $17 million pretax charge relating to the final embassy claim.","Consolidated revenue was $7.2 billion, reflecting growth in Oil & Gas and Power segments, which is offset to some degree by lower revenue in Industrial & Infrastructure, as well as Government. New awards for the quarter were substantial at $7.2 billion, including $3.6 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure and $3.3 billion in Oil & Gas. Consolidated backlog was right at $37 billion, which is down from a year ago, primarily due to the downturn in the Mining & Metals market. Having said that, the margin dollars in backlog and the margin percent in backlog are higher than they were last year.","Our financial results are summarized in the table on Slide 4. And as you know, the full detail by segment is included in our earnings release.","Now if you turn to Slide 5. Oil & Gas awards in the quarter include significant new scope on a large upstream project in Russia and a FEED award for Sasol's ethane cracker and associated derivative chemical facilities in Lake Charles, Louisiana. This important FEED program is already underway and is expected to be complete later this year.","This project, along with Dow Chemical's projects that were awarded earlier, is further evidence that we are especially well positioned for the U.S. petrochemical buildout. Looking ahead, we expect to hear a decision relatively soon on the CPChem ethylene cracker, which we are bidding together with JGC.","In addition to our strong position in petrochemicals, we're excited about a number of LNG prospects, which we are also proactively pursuing, some with JGC as well. And we're well into the FEED on the Anadarko's onshore facility in Mozambique, and we're currently pursuing export facilities for the Kitimat project in Canada and the Cameron project in Louisiana.","We also continued to see a significant number of Oil & Gas opportunities internationally, including major upstream and downstream programs in Canada, Mexico, Kazakhstan, Australia, Asia and the Middle East. We expect that strong FEED demand will translate into EPC awards over the next few years. Ending Oil & Gas backlog was $18.7 billion, which is down modestly from $19.5 billion a year ago.","Moving to Industrial & Infrastructure. The new awards for the quarter were $3.6 billion, which included $2.9 billion award for the expansion of the Cerro Verde copper project in Peru for Freeport-McMoRan. This construction management contract is a follow-on to the engineering and procurement phases that we recently completed.","We also booked $184 million infrastructure contract to provide program management and construction supervision services for the $5 billion Sharq crossing program, part of Qatar's ambitious development plans ahead of the 2022 World Cup. Industrial & Infrastructure backlog ticked up to $16.2 billion in the second quarter, driven by the large mining award in Peru.","Now please turn to Slide 6. The ending backlog for Government segment was $531 million. This compares to $505 million a year ago. New awards in the second quarter were $256 million, primarily for the LOGCAP task orders. We're beginning to see a reduction in the task order volume on LOGCAP contracts in Afghanistan. For the balance of 2013, we expect a quarterly revenue run rate of approximately $350 million to $400 million, which is below the $500 million run rate that we've generally experienced up through the first quarter.","As I mentioned earlier, we recorded a $17 million charge in the quarter relating to a court ruling in our final embassy claim with the U.S. government. This result was particularly frustrating as the court ruled in our favor on 2 of the 3 central issues, yet awarded us only a small fraction of what we believe we're owed. We are considering an appeal to the amount of the award.","Moving to Global Services. The segment reported $28 million in segment profit and $154 million in revenue. This group continues to be active in supporting projects, as well as external customers. Global Services organization is leading our effort to support and grow our integrated construction and fabrication and supply-chain capabilities.","Our fabrication resources in Mexico, the Philippines and Canada are ready to support and in some cases, are already supporting some of the large projects globally. In anticipation of the huge demand for skilled craft resources in the Gulf region, we recently have opened training centers to support the Dow Chemical ethylene cracker complex in Freeport, Texas and expanded our welder training program in Houston.","Power backlog was $1.6 billion at the end of the quarter. The group continues to track opportunities in new gas-fired plants, solar facilities, as well as plant betterment programs. Looking at the rest of 2013, I think we're on track to book the Brunswick County combined-cycle, gas-fired plant for Dominion Energy in the third quarter and see several opportunities for environmental retrofit projects later in the year.","With that, I'd turn it over to Biggs to review some of the details of the operating performance, as well as some of the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation. As David indicated, consolidated backlog at quarter end was $37 billion. The percentage of fixed-price contracts in our overall backlog declined from 18% last quarter to 16% at quarter end. Our geographic mix stands at 70% international and 30% in the United States.","Moving to corporate items on Slide 8. G&A expense for the quarter was $32 million, which is comparable to the last quarter and a year ago. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 31%, which was on the low end of our expectations for the year. We expect the rate for the second half of the year to be in the 32% to 34% range.","Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's financial condition remains very strong, with cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities of $2.6 billion at quarter end. This is up about $100 million from where we ended last quarter but level with where we started the year.","Cash flow from operating activities in the second quarter was $264 million, driven mainly by earning sources. While working capital balances were modestly better at the end of the quarter, on a year-to-date basis, we've seen reductions in advanced billing balances as we make progress on certain projects and increases in account receivable balances, mainly due to the timing of collections.","It's worth noting that one major customer advance has now been fully utilized, so this should be less of a cash flow drag going forward. We expect more normal working capital patterns in the second half of the year, with corresponding improvements in the cash flow.","If you look at our cash flow statement, you will see that we did not repurchase any shares during the second quarter. With the expectation that future cash flow will improve, we anticipate a resumption of share purchases in the second half of the year, consistent with our capital allocation philosophy.","I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2013, which is on Slide 9. While we continue to see a number of opportunities in our Oil & Gas business, the charge relating to our final embassy claim and as we've stated last quarter, the slowdown in Mining & Metals have put pressure on the upper end of our EPS guidance range for 2013. As a result, we're tightening the EPS guidance range for 2013, $3.85 to $4.20 per diluted share, which compares to the previous range of $3.85 to $4.35.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. One, David, could you just talk about how we should think about the burn rate related to mining in the back half of the year relative to what you originally thought and how we should think about that going into 2014? And then my second question relates to Oil & Gas. One, I think some of the projects that had more procurement roll-off in the first half of the year fairly soon, so can you talk about that and how that should potentially impact margins in the back half of the year? And then also, Kitimat and Cameron are 2 obviously big awards. Can you talk about the potential timing of them and what you think your positioning is with JGC relative to, I think, Kitimat, you're bidding against KBR and Kiewit. And Cameron, there's a number of bidders out there, but your likelihood of winning those projects?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Jamie. With regard to mining, I guess I would characterize what's going on in mining is most of the miners are taking a deep breath, as think I've said before. I think the Cerro Verde award shows that there's still people ready to pull the trigger, spend money on things that make sense. I just spent last week in Australia on several of our job sites and I think the need is still there. So I think when you combine the markets, you combine the fact that each of the mining companies have basically new management teams. I would suggest that what we're seeing is a little bit of hiatus right now, and I believe that we'll see a resurgence of that as we get into mid '14 on some of these programs. Having said that, I think that we still have a fair amount of projects going on that still have to complete. And so I don't think you're going to see much of a change as we get into the second half of this year -- or we're already into the second half of this year. But I think it could have a little bit of slowing effect on the first part of next year just simply because of a lack of new awards that are going in. But the group is very active. We're doing a lot of still study work. There's still good projects out there, they're just not as big as the ones that we have experienced over the last bit of time, but I do see that it's going to improve. You're talking about Oil & Gas and there was 2 questions there, one on margin and one on LNG. As I've said in the prepared remarks, we're seeing better margin, both in terms of dollars and in terms of percentages in our backlog, which is a very good trend. And I see that continuing as we get into this next cycle. I'm not really going to comment on how that actually burns. But relative to LNG and I think our relationship with JGC, I'm very pleased with that. I think the team has done a really good job of looking at that market and coming up with an alignment that is satisfactory to us, as well as JGC. But frankly speaking, it's very satisfactory to our client base. On the timing, you know that, as well as I do, on the timing of Kitimat and Cameron, I think, Jamie, unless we have a really good opportunity to win something, we really don't go after it. So I feel good about our position. I feel really good about our relationship, our growing relationship with JGC. I've known them for many years and worked with them for many years around the world, primarily in the Middle East, back in the day when I lived out there. So I feel very good about where we stand from a strategic perspective and feel good about our ability to win some of these projects.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But David, just as a follow-up, I feel like in the first half of the year, in -- within Oil & Gas, there were some projects that weren't favorable to margins that roll off fairly soon. Is that fair outside of the pricing trends that you talked about and better utilization? And then two, within those 2 projects, within Kitimat and Cameron, I think some of the comments that have been made is the LNG projects, and potentially GTL projects, could have a greater probability of going sort of fixed-price versus cost-plus. So can you talk about sort of the risks associated with those projects going fixed price? And then...","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we're quite comfortable with fixed-price work. We've done that for a lot of years. It's just recently, we -- our percentages have dropped. So the fact that they are either negotiated lump sums or they're competitively bid lump sums, we feel like we can be competitive and we feel like we can be profitable in executing those programs. So I'm pretty confident about our ability to deliver on those projects. With regard to some of the burn-off, there are a couple of large projects, but I'd remind you that percentages are interesting, but not what I am most focused on. I'm focused on earnings growth with these projects. And if they have a fair amount of CFM in them, so be it, as long as we feel comfortable with the profit dollar growth. So yes, the one in Canada that has been a significant drag, I think, when you think of mining, it's got the same pattern. There's probably going to be a few more that we put in to backlog in the coming years that will have the same impact. And when I think of just the percentages, I'm interested in it, but I'm more interested in the margin dollars. And as I said, we're seeing margin dollars increase in backlog, which is, I think, is a good testament to our earnings power -- earning power going forward.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, so just following up on Oil & Gas for a second, you've done a good job here of keeping book-to-bill around 1 over the first couple of quarters of the year. And I kind of thought your prospects might have been a little bit more back-end loaded. So as we go into the back half of the year and into next year, can you sustain that book-to-bill around 1? I know you're going to tell me it's lumpy. But generally speaking, can you sustain it? And then is it going to be really -- everybody continues to be focused on North America, but it seems like you guys have just as many prospects internationally. Would you sort of agree with that statement?","David T. Seaton","I absolutely agree with that statement. It's really good that the U.S. is in a growth mode. From an economic development perspective, it's a great story. And we're really well positioned, as I said, in most of those markets that are growing in the United States. So that's a good story, I think, for the U.S. in general and us specifically in executing those projects. But as I said in my prepared remarks, I mean, whether it's Canada or Kazakhstan, Asia, continuing work in Australia, I mean, the opportunities slate -- as I think I've said in the past, is as big as I've ever seen. And I think we're very well positioned in most cases. So to answer your first question, as you said, it will be lumpy. But I think as we go through the next probably 6 quarters, probably as far as I'd like to get out on a limb here, I think you're going to see some of the same book-to-burn ratios. There are a lot of big projects coming in between say, the fourth quarter of this year and the fourth quarter of next year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's great. So David, let's take the Bay Bridge question out of the way. So can you talk about the steel rod issue? There's obviously been some press on it. Do you still assume performance incentives in your new EPS guidance? I mean, how should we think about the risk of the project?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'll answer it this way. The bridge, as it stands today, is significantly more safe than the bridge they're driving on. The fix for the rods is well known and has been approved by Caltrans. That fix is not a long-duration fix nor is it an impact on our ability to open this thing on time. So I feel pretty good about the relationship that we've got with Caltrans. I feel good about the fix and how it will progress as long as we get the approvals from them to execute. There are some competing ideas on how you fix it, but Caltrans has already picked the fix and we're going through the process.","Operator","We'll go next to Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, in U.S. chemicals, in addition to the projects that you listed in the deck, I'm wondering if you could just give us your broad overview on the industry. How many more ethylene and propylene, new build products do you expect to reach final investment decision within the next 12 months? And out of those, can you give us a rough sense of how many you're pursuing?","David T. Seaton","Well, there's -- I think there's either 7 or 9 discussed in the open. I believe, by the end of the year, there'll be 4 sanctioned. I think that in addition to Sasol and Dow and the CPChem one, the other one is Shell Franklin. And I think that will be -- that decision will be made pretty quickly as well. We feel pretty good about having a pretty high batting average there. We're already batting 500.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in terms of -- in Industrial & Infrastructure, excluding Mining, I wonder if you could just flush out the bid opportunities you see over the next 12 to 18 months? To what extent can you deliver backlog growth in that part of the business?","David T. Seaton","And I guess, you're talking about Mining and Infrastructure separately, is that your question?","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Yes, so -- and for -- so the I&I segment, excluding Mining.","David T. Seaton","I think it's going to be hard to maintain backlog in that segment in the near term. As I said, I think, towards the back half of next year is when Mining will come. I think we've got great opportunities in Infrastructure. We've got great opportunities in the Manufacturing and Life Sciences segment. But those projects just aren't big enough to keep the backlog static. So I think we will see some decline as we go through the end of this year and into next year. I think overall, I'm pretty pleased with the fact that we've kind of stopped the decline in backlog as a company when you think we've burned $7-point-whatever billion and we awarded $7.2 billion. So I think that's a good sign that the Oil & Gas engine is taking off, but we still have a good robust business in Mining. But I think for Mining backlog, to kind of change to that northerly trajectory, I think we got to get in to next year to see exactly what the Mining guys do and whether my prediction plays out or not.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And you've had some pretty significant wins at Tappan Zee recently. Just to clarify the overall opportunities that -- on pure Infrastructure project, outside of Mining, is still as robust as it's been over the past couple of quarters. Can you just help us get a rough sense of how deep that pipeline of opportunities is?","David T. Seaton","It's pretty deep. But I think it's one of these things where the gestation period on these projects is pretty long. When you consider you're dealing with municipalities, in some cases states and the governments and the like, it just takes a little bit longer. I think earlier in the year, we were successful with Tappan Zee, we were successful with the Horseshoe project in Dallas, which clearly add to backlog and profitability going forward. It's -- they're in their early stages of some proposals right now. But my guess is that we won't see any real big awards in infrastructure until we get into fourth quarter or first quarter. But they're working on some really good ones. I'm really pleased with where they are.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just -- on the guidance change, you didn't cite the LOGCAP slowdown, which, I calculated, at about $0.04 of headwind. Was there any other offset somewhere in there for that? And then, I guess, how surprised were you by that slowdown and how you're thinking about 2014? And then just one last one on the guidance of -- how does the Cerro Verde benefit in '13 compare against the headwind from Pascua-Lama?","David T. Seaton","Let me get the mining one. Pascua-Lama is basically delayed until we help them get their permit reinstated, and part of that is a water project that we're actually executing right now. I'd like to think that Pascua-Lama will be back on target as we get into next year. I think that Cerro Verde basically replaces what Pascua was doing relative to burn. So I think it kind of trades one for another. Now on LOGCAP, it's pretty consistent with what we thought. And I'll let Biggs talk about the numbers specifically, but we anticipated that there is going to be troop withdrawal in -- during this year, but holding pretty steady on our ability to -- the headcount that we have is supporting both the war fighter, as well as the infrastructure there in Bagram and the FOBs that are there. It's always anticipated that we would go down a little bit, which we're experiencing. They stayed pretty stable because when the military withdraws, if you look at Iraq as an example, they displace military war fighters with people like us until the withdrawal is effected. I don't believe you're going to see the 100% withdrawal that you saw in Iraq in Afghanistan. And I think the administration is saying that there's a fair amount coming home this year and a fair amount next year, but there'll be a significant force left behind that will be typically be housed at Bagram, which we're responsible for. So I think that, whereas it will drop and it will be a hole we've got to fill up in earnings going forward. It's not the cliff that I think a lot of people anticipate. Biggs, I don't know if you want to give any color to the numbers.","Biggs C. Porter","Yes, the -- without going -- and literally calculating variances on a cents-per-share basis, certainly, yes, lower volume on LOGCAP alone would create some reduction in the second half or the first half, but there are some other opportunities within Government. They have to offset that. Also, G&A is running better by example. Taxes had run better. There are -- so there are a variety of moving parts when we look at resetting or when we're tightening the range as to what we considered. There's probably a pretty good visibility for the remainder of this year on the LOGCAP run rate. I think it's too early to call 2014.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just to follow-up on Andy's question on the Bay Bridge thing. Under what scenario or what's the risk that you have to take a charge on that or that it's a drag on earnings? And then I guess maybe conversely, is there a chance that you'd still have some upside to what you're accruing in earnings right now?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, we haven't booked the incentives. We typically don't book those until it gets to the point of having cleared all of the hurdles associated with it. So there's no risk associated with that from the standpoint of anything we have on the books. He asked, was it in our guidance? And explicitly, we don't put any one particular event or won't comment on it as to what's in or out in the guidance because we look at the prospects across all of our programs and all the potential outcomes and setting a range, and you could always say something is -- something is there in the range because we considered it. But it's also out of the range because others things could be there, substitution of it, so...","David T. Seaton","Well, I don't see any downside either because the design and the specification of those was done by the designer, which is Caltrans. We're just a constructor on that, so I don't see any repercussions relative to the solution.","Operator","We'll go next to Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","I just wanted to ask you a question on the backlog margin expectations. I know you mentioned that your margin dollars and percentages have increased over the last quarter. Can we expect that trend to continue for the next couple of quarters? Can you talk about some of the different moving pieces in the backlog? And also, on the I&I segment awards, excluding this one large mining award, your orders were close to $700 million, so should we assume that sort of the run rate for the next couple of quarters, or should we expect an improvement in that segment as well?","David T. Seaton","I don't think you can expect to have the I&I segment at $3 billion plus going forward. But I wouldn't say that it'd be a substantial drop. I think they've still got a lot of opportunities out there, so there's a little bit of a decrease in the short term on their new award intake. But again, I think the projects just aren't as big. But from a profitability standpoint, I feel good about where we're headed. Relative to the increase in margin in backlog, that's always the good sign for us that things are improving. I do believe that the quality of the backlog margin will improve as we go through the rest of this year and into next year. And it's going to be primarily driven by our E&C segment. So I feel pretty good about where we are and the trends that we're seeing. I wouldn't venture a specific number of quarters or a specific amount. But just directionally, it's improving and we expect that to continue for some time to come.","Operator","We'll go next to Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess, the one thing I wanted to talk to you about was the Power side. We've seen a regulatory impasse and paralysis. But as I hear the utilities calls and have been monitoring their recent announcements, seems like there seems to be some positive movement on retirements and new found replacement announcements. So would love to get your thoughts if you're feeling a little better on the visibility on the Power side?","David T. Seaton","I think we do feel a little better on the visibility. And the projects that are being decided are primarily on the gas side, as well as some typical of the plant betterment. You're correct, the lack of decision on the Casper rules, I think, put the power generators into a question of, how do we comply without clear direction? And I think that does delay any significant work on fixing the coal fleet. I do believe that they'll figure that out. But when I look at the plant betterment piece that we do on the coal fleet, I think there's a pretty good opportunity, even without the regulations that are necessary. But I'm particularly pleased with the power visibility to deal with the slowdown and do the right things relative to the organization and maintain their capabilities. A couple of these projects that are ongoing are -- we're able to train that next wave of construction superintendent, which I think is absolutely key to our future. This project that we announced that we hope that will be sanctioned from Dominion is another example of direct-hire construction. So I mean, they've kind of been beat up. We -- when I can tell you that within our company, we've beat them up on the lack of growth, but I do see some pretty positive signs. Like I said, as we get into next year, and if there is a decision on regulation, I think it only increases that -- the size of the opportunity for us.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And just a follow-up to that. You had a nice return to profitability on the Power side this quarter. There seems to be some positive movement on headline news in regards to DOE. Any thoughts on new scale as you look forward which are incremental?","David T. Seaton","Well, we submitted our FOA, the proposal in June and we're eagerly awaiting that.","Biggs C. Porter","The decision will be in September.","David T. Seaton","The decision's in September. We continue to have dialogue with several potential investors, and I think it's going exactly as we had planned.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Will Gabrielski from Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So as you guys think about the Gulf Coast and the amount of activity you're tracking there, what are you guys seeing develop maybe versus 3 months ago about potential bottlenecks, whether it's process engineers or craft labor? And as you think about your fabricating strategy, are there still holes you want to fill there? Or is the Philippines a real option for Gulf Coast fabrication?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'm excited about what's going on there. We know how to do this and I love it. The pinch points, I don't think you're going to be project management or engineering. It's like I said before, it's going to be craft and attracting that next wave of craft employee to our company and to the industry, frankly. And that's why we've stepped out and invested in some training centers, welding schools and making sure that we're taking advantage of the marketplace there with good talented people that have worked with us before. So we feel really good about our position in able -- in being able to execute on our commitments to our customers, even with the tightness in craft, and I think that's going to be the pinch point. Fabrication, the quick answer to your question is absolutely, the Philippines can be competitive. And in fact, in some of the programs we're looking at, we utilize that yard that we have in the Philippines. But we're also looking south to the yard that we've got with Grupo ICA in Tampico that we've owned for 10 years. We're looking at expanding that yard. And I think that, as I said, that's going to be the fun part. I feel really good about our ability to deliver on these EPC projects in the Gulf Coast. I'm excited about what's going on there.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then a follow-up in terms of your margin commentary around Oil & Gas. I guess as you talk about being comfortable with lump sum, turnkey work and at the same time, we're talking about projects that might still carry a high level of CFM embedded in the dollars you booked. But as that lump sum works starts to move into backlog potentially here over the few quarters, should we assume obviously you're getting compensated for that risk?","David T. Seaton","Hope so. To try and answer, absolutely. We're looking at these projects like we should be looking at them, relative to the return on investment. But I caution you, from one perspective, don't just focus on the percentage, focus on the earnings dollars that are coming out of those programs.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then my follow-up to that is -- because talk about the earnings dollars and not the percentages -- but the returns, I would presume then, should also be compared favorably to what you may have seen historically, even if the percentages are lower, as long as the dollars are up and you're not committing extra capital to these jobs? Is that fair, Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Yes. I don't see anything different about what will happen in working capital going forward, at this point, it ought to stay fairly normal relationships. So that's just one of those -- it should be normal.","Operator","The next question comes from Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Two quick questions. First, how would you characterize the mix shift in Mining -- from Mining into sort of your Infrastructure business? Should we think about that as neutral to revenue next year? And how should we think about it from a profit contribution standpoint, is it neutral or is it modestly incrementally positive?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, I think it's premature to give guidance next year. But just in terms of talking about what will drive margins over time, if you look out over a longer period of time, certainly Mining is a lower-margin business. So as we shift more to Infrastructure, we do expect a higher margin rate. Of course, once again, and as David said many times, we really worry more about margin dollars than we do about rate. But if you're trying to model it off of rate, you would expect a shift over time. That having said that, doesn't necessarily mean that there's some near-term dramatic shift because as we close out mining projects and eliminate contingencies, there's also a natural ability to have some improvement in margins if we successfully complete projects. So that will support some higher margin out of the remaining mining activities that are in backlog. And then the higher-margin Infrastructure activities is just going to layer on top of that, so...","David T. Seaton","Well, I think the only other thing I'd add is it really depends on whether or not my prediction is correct about mining projects coming back in the second half of '14.","Biggs C. Porter","Right.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And lastly, on cash flow in the second half of the year and cash uses and possibly accelerating your buyback program, should we think about sort of the cash sitting on your balance sheet as cash that's not going to be tapped for future uses of buyback program or acquisitions and, therefore, think that only future cash flow generation would be allocated towards those uses?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, we do time our -- base our purchases, based upon cash flow. So for the most part, we don't go in and tap cash on the balance sheet. There is some amount of flexibility there, but our tradition is just a conservative and only repurchase based upon cash as it's generated. The amount of cash in the balance sheet, obviously, has got some different components to it. It's got some amount to it, which is tied up in JVs and some which is restricted to projects based upon the structure of the advanced payments we have with some projects. So it's always a little complex when you start to dive in and say how much of that is something we're comfortably [ph] using or not. Plus, on top of that, we like to keep $1 billion or so in cushion for normal ebbs and flows of the business. So I won't say there is 0 flexibility there, but our tendency is to base repurchases on cash generated as opposed to what's already there on the balance sheet.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","David, so a couple of your competitors talked about some of these large Oil & Gas projects seeing some pushouts or delays in general. I just wanted to get just your kind of take on that on some of these other ones that you're working on, FEED, or maybe almost looking at doing FEEDs.","David T. Seaton","Well, I'll make a couple of comments. One is, the projects have gotten so much larger that companies are taking one more quarter to take a look at things and one more quarter to get the sanctioning from their boards. But I would suggest that even with that, it's kind of in line with what our expectations are. When I think about the CPChem project that's pending, they stuck with their schedule. And in all cases, Dow, both in terms of the cracker and the PDH plants that we're doing, stuck to the schedule that was -- what was originally planned. And as far as that schedule sanctioning, I don't think you're going to see any difference in Sasol, I don't think you're going to any difference in Shell in that first wave. And when you think about GTL, when you think about LNG, those projects are on track along with schedules that we saw. So yes, things have been pushed back, but not in an unanticipated fashion, if that makes sense.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And just maybe your thoughts on the LNG and kind of the approval process that's been going on broadly for those opportunities in the U.S. and with the DOE? Kind of what's your expectation for the cadence of those approvals coming out and how does that affect your outlook there?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'm not sure I would venture a guess as to what the -- how the government -- how quickly the government's going to work. I think that, as I've said, shale gas, it's got 4 uses and it's going to be -- the cadence of them is going to be based on product. Petrochemical obviously in the beginning, I think some Power work is second. When we think about Dominion and we think about the LCRA project that we're doing in Texas, I think GTL is probably behind that and then LNG for export behind that, and it's just a timing issue. So when you think about it, the biggest issue is, can they get export licenses? But they're not going to export anything for 4 years, even if you started the first one today. So I think they're going to go along their normal schedule and it's in line with -- as I said in the previous question, it's in line with our expectations on timing. It's just going to take some time. But again, these are huge investments that these customers are making. And I think that their own diligence is going to drive schedule decisions more so than regulatory decisions.","Operator","And the next question is from George O'Leary with Tudor, Pickering.","George O'Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Talk a little bit about kind of the timing around expectations on Kitimat given your presence on kind of the rework of the FEED there by Chevron and then maybe some more color on timing around Mozambique project as well?","David T. Seaton","Well, Mozambique, the schedule on that is sometime in '14 for the decision on who goes forward because that's a competitive FEED that we're doing. So it's on track for some decision sometime mid next year. Kitimat, I'm not sure what that schedule is. We're very pleased to be a participant on that project and doing a little bit of early works on that. Others have done the same thing. But I wouldn't venture a guess on the schedule. I would make this comment though, and I think my competitors would agree with this. These projects are large and in some cases, nobody's going to get the whole thing. In some cases, they will, but I would say, when you look at some of the bigger LNG plants and the GTL plants, there's going to be several of us successful on significant pieces of those projects. I tend to believe that Fluor is in a good position to do very, very well. But others will get work in this boom as well. So let's make sure that when people talk about a $10 billion LNG plant, I don't think anybody's going to get $10 billion of any of them.","George O'Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","That makes perfect sense. And then if you just -- speaking generally, if you look outside of the U.S. and Canada and you talk about being at least equally as excited about the international opportunities, could you talk about what regions are driving that and maybe what end markets within the regions are driving the excitement on the international front?","David T. Seaton","Well, it's the same dynamics. But I think the regions -- we're still excited about what's going on in Canada. We see growth in Canada. The Middle East, we see great opportunity there, notwithstanding some of the political challenges on things like the refinery work in Kuwait, but we still see great opportunity there. We continue to see growth in Russia, primarily Sakhalin, and have done, I think, very well there. China is still a good place, even though you've seen the slowdown either from a petrochemical and a refining perspective. They've got to keep up with not only demand, but in some cases, they've got to improve the environmental natures of their fuel if they're going to compete on the world market. So when you think about China, you think about Southeast Asia, Malaysia, Indonesia, Vietnam, all of these places have, I think, growth opportunities for us. Australia, it's kind of interesting. They're taking a little bit of hiatus on the mining side, but they're also trying to think through some of the dynamics around LNG export. We're very successful in the upstream piece of Santos, and I think that will continue. But you're seeing people like Shell kind of pull back on projects like Arrow, so I think there's a little bit of a wait-and-see attitude with regard to Australia, but still, I think, a significant opportunity for Fluor. South America, both in terms of Brazil, Mexico and Argentina, we see growth opportunities in Oil & Gas. So it's a pretty global business, and I think Peter Oosterveer and his team have done an outstanding job of diversifying the client base and diversifying the region to where we're not as beholding to a single country or region going forward. I'm very bullish on what Oil & Gas is doing. I'm very bullish on what Mining is doing. I mean, if you think about it, they went from a full out run to hitting a little bit of a wall. And I think they've done a great good job of doing the right things in managing their business and making sure that they're maintaining the position with the customers and making sure that we are there when the crank gets turned again. So I think geographically, there's really no weak spots, particularly given the petrochemical resurgence in the United States.","Operator","We'll go next to John Ellison with BB&T Capital Markets.","John D. Ellison - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","In regards to M&A, are there any sectors or areas that you'd like to expand into through acquisition going forward?","David T. Seaton","I mean, I think there's places within existing markets where we could strengthen our offering, and we're actively looking at that. When we've talked about this in the past, there's really no consolidating moves that make sense, so I think they will be niche in nature. Some of them small, some of them larger. I don't want to pigeonhole, but in a region I say that it's a precursor to the example I'm going to give you. We bought a company in Mozambique called ServiTrade that has an equipment business, but also owns one of the concrete batch plant -- one of 2 concrete batch plants in the country. So that was a nominal investment to make sure that whoever needs the concrete can get it from us, as an example. So you're going to see us make acquisitions to give us a foothold in a specific country of growth. I think you'll see us make some acquisitions in places where, from a technical perspective, we need -- we've got a little bit of a deficit. But I think the beauty of Fluor is we're so diverse in terms of market and geography that we really just need niches to gain that foothold. And I think that's what you can expect going forward.","John D. Ellison - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, great. And my last question, you mentioned that you're training craft labor down the Gulf Coast, in particular, for the Dow Chemical project down there. Is this allowing you to mitigate a meaningful amount of the labor or wage inflation? And do you expect that the impact of these programs will allow you to better position, I guess, for bidding competitiveness?","David T. Seaton","Absolutely. Absolutely. But I think fabrication has a piece in that as well because part of mitigating the craft risk problem is taking some of the work off the site into a controlled environment. And when you think about the yards that we've got, basically, we're mitigating that risk and controlling our own destiny, which is something that I've said in the past. So I think when you look at owning the craft and owning the fabrication, you have the ability to mitigate a lot of the risk on costs that exist and hence, give you better predictability, even in a lump sum environment. So I think we've done some things really, really well to prepare for a change in the marketplace, particularly in the United States, and we're in a good position to capture that and deliver the -- expected profitability.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Connors with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","If I recall correctly, one of your Middle East petchem projects had sort of come as one lump sum award because you didn't -- or the client didn't want to have to go back through NOC and government approval. Just wondering if that's the same for a lot of the Gulf Coast crackers, or are they going to be phased? And if so, what parts of the project you're receiving now and what scope expansions we could receive later?","David T. Seaton","Well, in terms of Dow, that full EPC value is in backlog and we're blowing and going on, on that cracker. With regard to Sasol, we're in the FEED phase. There's a sanctioning somewhere towards the end of this year, early next year, for that full EPC to be released. The CPChem job, we're awaiting decision or the information on that, that would start into -- that would be basically a full EPC award. I think Franklin follows the -- Franklin project for Shell follows the same model, so it's upon us. And I think the next big piece in Oil & Gas is the release of some of the FEED work on the GTL-type projects in the Gulf Coast, so it's -- I mean, we're kind of in, I think, a long-term growth spurt that really fits us well.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then it was sort of hinted at before, but with possibly a little bit more lump sum being awarded in the Oil & Gas segment. Was just wondering if the earnings profile sort of changes the traditional Oil & Gas where we could see it more like a Power and Infrastructure, some of the earnings are back end loaded of a project.","David T. Seaton","Yes, that would be my expectation.","Operator","And we'll take our final question from Mike Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's it. I'm all set, guys.","David T. Seaton","Okay. Thank you, operator, for managing that for us, and I really appreciate everybody participating on the call this morning.","Overall, I think we delivered another solid quarter for both in earnings and a new award perspective. I'm really confident with regard to our market position in things like petrochemicals, but I don't dismiss mining in some of these other businesses that we are equally well positioned. But in the case of E&C, I do see significant upside and additional EPC wins as we go through this year.","We will continue to win the FEEDs on many of these programs, and I -- as I think I indicated, I'm pretty excited about the LNG export facilities that we're pursuing, as well as the gas-to-liquids market here in the United States, as avenues for growth.","Finally, I think we have a strong slate of international projects. So it's interesting to talk about the United States again because it's been such a long time that we -- since we've had significant economic development in the U.S. But our international prospect list is just as long, and I continue to be very encouraged by our opportunity to grow the company.","With that, again, I really appreciate your interest in our company, as well as your confidence in Fluor. I hope everyone has a good day, and goodbye.","Operator","Again, that does conclude today's presentation.

Please go ahead, Mr. Lockwood.","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thank you very much, operator. Welcome, everyone, to Fluor's Second Quarter 2014 Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after the market closed, and we've posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference while making our prepared remarks this afternoon.","Before getting started, I would like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2 of the slide presentation. During today's call and presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements which do reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are also posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","So with that, let me turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon and -- to everyone, and thank you for joining us. After today's market performance, I hope you're not joining us from a ledge somewhere, and those of you that are, I know who you are.","On today's call, we'll review our results for the second quarter and discuss our outlook for the remainder of '14. Now if you'll turn to Slide 3, I want to start by covering some of the highlights of the quarter. Our earnings for the quarter were in line with our expectations for a gradual increase as we moved through this year, with a stronger second half than the first half. Net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were $163 million or $1.02 per diluted share, which compares with $161 million or $0.98 per diluted share a year ago.","Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $313 million, which was a 9% increase from $288 million 1 year ago. Segment profit results were mainly driven by a 57% increase in oil and gas, reflecting very strong performance. Oil and gas margins rose again this quarter, resulting from a mix shift towards higher margin from FEED and engineering work, with a lower relative construction content.","Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $5.3 billion, which was down from our $7.2 billion a year ago, mainly due to a significantly lower revenue base in Mining business line. We expect revenues to go up from this point. Importantly, Oil and Gas revenue is expected to increase once a number of the recently booked projects move into the field and construction gets underway.","We got another solid quarter with strong cash flow from operations and continue to return cash to shareholders. To date, we've returned over $380 million through share repurchases and dividends. We expect the trend of consistent positive cash flow generation to continue.","New awards for the quarter were $5.9 billion, including $3.1 billion in government, $1.5 billion in oil and gas, $1.2 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure bookings. Consolidated backlog for the quarter rose to $40.3 billion, which is up 9% from $37 billion a year ago.","Our financial results are summarized on -- in the table on Slide 4, if you turn to that, and I'll continue my remarks on Slide 5. For the quarter, oil and gas segment booking -- booked new awards of $1.5 billion, including a delayed coking unit for refinery in Belgium, additional work on the Santos gas processing facility in Australia, EPCM for a reverse osmosis project in Saudi Arabia and an LNG break bulk facility in The Netherlands.","Similar to last quarter, the group booked over 170 individual small- to medium-sized projects, which is indicative of a strong FEED pipeline within Oil and Gas. Ending backlog for Oil and Gas stood at $24.2 billion, which is up 29% from 1 year ago.","We continue to track a robust list of size -- sizable prospects in the United States, Canada, Mexico, the Middle East and Asia. Prospects in the United States, Canada and Mexico, an expected number of major FEED programs will convert to EPC awards as we move to the back half of this year and into '15.","Please turn to Slide 6. New awards were just over $1.2 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure, which included the engineering, procurement and construction management of a large manufacturing facility in the United States. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $9.2 billion, which was down from $16.2 billion 1 year ago. Again, this decline continues to be driven by the lack of significant awards in the Mining & Metals business line.","However, the Mining & Metals business line is showing some signs of return, and we could see modest awards for projects later this year, as well as into next year. We continue to pursue a number of prospects in infrastructure. However, it's a highly competitive marketplace, which remains a challenge. We have had some recent success in Europe, where Fluor -- a Fluor-led consortium was recently selected as the preferred bidder on the A9 PPP-financed highway project in The Netherlands. The project will go into backlog at a future date, after the contract and financing agreements are concluded.","Now turning to Slide 7. Fluor's government group posted its share -- sorry, posted substantial new awards in the quarter of $3.1 billion, which include Fluor's portion at $2.2 billion for the Magnox multi-year nuclear decommissioning project in the U.K. and approximately $820 million for the LOGCAP IV Task Order program. Ending backlog rose to $5.2 billion, including unfunded backlog amounts from $2.6 billion 1 quarter ago.","I'm also pleased to announce that last week, we were selected as the preferred bidder on the Paducah deactivation and shutdown contract. This approximately $420 million project will be booked in the third quarter. The Paducah contract is a great example of taking our decade -- decades-long nuclear remediation experience to provide safe, cost-effective solutions to the Department of Energy.","In the Power segment, the new awards were modest, reflecting a limited opportunity set and highly competitive market environment. Ending backlog was $1.7 billion, which compares to $1.6 billion 1 year ago. We will continue to bid for new gas-fired opportunities in North America this year and expect a slate of prospects to improve as we get into 2015.","This quarter, we also executed a cooperative agreement with the DOE on the cost-sharing structure for the NuScale funding. This is an important milestone for our investment, and we believe this catalyst will help us attract additional investors, manufacturers and other supply chain partners.","Before I get Biggs to discuss the details of our quarter's -- quarterly operating performance, I want to spend just a moment talking about the progress and frankly, momentum behind the recent organizational realignment actions that we took in the first quarter.","Fluor's always been known as a company that can build large complex projects for our clients anywhere in the world. The execution of these projects under the typical EPCM model has served us well. What we see today, however, is an increasing demand for our firm to partner with our customers and provide an integrated solution, not just services.","What's this mean for Fluor? It means that we can better serve our clients by taking more of an enterprise-wide mindset. And over the past year, we've made progress in a number of these areas, including increasing the amount and capability of our self-perform construction on projects, expanding our global fabrication facilities and leveraging our expertise in third-gen modularization design tool that we have developed, as well as using our procurement and supply chain network to win new work.","As part of this initiative, we have undertaken steps to realign and flatten the organization to better facilitate integration and cooperation across the company at lower cost. I'm confident that these initiatives will improve execution and drive additional capital efficiency and project certainty for our customers.","Most importantly, this, along with applying what we're calling our One Fluor mindset across the enterprise, will help drive improvements to our bottom line. With that, I'll now turn it over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and core financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 of the presentation. I'll start by providing a few comments on our second quarter performance then move to the balance sheet.","As expected, overall revenue for the quarter was down fairly significantly year-over-year, mainly due to the continued falloff in mining activity. Oil and Gas revenue was flat compared to last year but increased modestly over the first quarter.","As David mentioned, we continue to execute a substantial amount of FEED and engineering activity in oil and gas, which, combined with strong performance on projects in the quarter, is contributing to higher margins. As construction work starts to increase as a proportion of the project mix, revenue will increase. But as a result, we expect the margin percentage to moderate in the second half of the year.","Industrial & Infrastructure revenue continued to contract. This contraction, along with successful project closeouts on both the Mining & Metals and Infrastructure business lines, contributed to strong margins in the quarter.","In Power, results for the quarter improved from a year ago, mainly due to the accrual of approximately $17 million for FOA cost-sharing of NuScale expenses from the last 3 quarters, which largely offset NuScale R&D expenses of $21 million in the second quarter.","Corporate G&A expense for the second quarter was $57 million, up from $32 million a year ago. The increase was primarily due to higher stock-based compensation expense, as well as organizational realignment expenses, including severance costs associated with some of the actions David described.","Please turn to Slide 9 to continue. The effective tax rate in the second quarter was approximately 32%, and we expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be between 32% and 33%.","During the quarter, we recorded an after-tax loss from discontinued operations of $85 million or $0.54 per diluted share relating to an opinion from the Missouri Court of Appeals regarding the Doe Run lead business that was sold 20 years ago, in 1994.","Both parties have filed motions for rehearing, and we will continue to take steps to enforce the indemnification provided by the buyer of the lead business. Depending on the ultimate resolution of the matter, this legal ruling may result in cash outflows in the future. For more background on the Doe Run issue, please refer to the Form 8-K that we filed on June 17, 2014.","Shifting to the balance sheet on Slide 10. Cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2.7 billion. As you know, the balance at any day can be heavily influenced by the timing of large receipts.","During the quarter, the company generated $239 million of positive cash flow from operating activities, repurchased approximately $132 million worth of Fluor shares and paid $34 million in dividends to shareholders.","David gave the stats for the year-to-date cash return to shareholders. I would like to further point out that over the last 4 quarters, we returned approximately $650 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. This compares to operating cash flow of $972 million and free cash flow of $657 million over that period. Free cash flow being operating cash flow less CapEx.","Moving to Slide 11, as previously mentioned, Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $40.3 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog remained at 20%, and the mix by geography was 30% U.S. and 70% non-U.S.","I will conclude my remarks by providing an update on our outlook for 2014, which is on Slide 12. Results for the first 6 months were consistent with our expectation for lower overall revenue offset by improved margins. Looking ahead, the company expects that improved bottom line results primarily attributable to the continuing strength in oil and gas will drive stronger EPS in the second half of the year. As a result, the company is maintaining its full year guidance range for 2014 EPS from continuing operations at $4.10 to $4.45 per diluted share.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, so there's been mixed messages about the cycle. I'm listening to your competitors, which I'm sure you've heard. Some guys have done well; some guys, maybe not so much. You seem pretty confident in your backlog and the potential for your backlog over the next couple of quarters and then into 2015. But maybe you can talk about where we sit today versus 3 months ago and last year and the potential of the backlog to improve here in the second half of the year and in 2015.","David T. Seaton","Andy, I don't think it's changed at all, or at least my opinion of it. We do a really good job of choosing carefully the projects we want to chase. We're conservative in how we take them in, and those projects are holding to the schedules that we expected. We really haven't seen, aside from mining, any change in the decision-making process of our customers over the last little while. Some things are moving quarter -- like this quarter to next quarter and next quarter to fourth quarter. But FID decisions are still being made in pretty much the timely manner that we anticipated. I still feel pretty positive about what I've said for the last year that the efforts that we took last year and the efforts in changing the way we're kind of doing our work has put us in a very good position to really look at the capital efficiency of these assets. And I think we're -- our offering has been accepted by our customers readily. And in the same vein, I think we've become more cost competitive and hopefully continue to improve margins along the way.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","So if we're sitting here next year at this time, David, backlog should be higher than it is today, in your opinion?","David T. Seaton","Yes, I think so. I think the real issue is how quickly these projects really move forward. There's some big projects to come, but I would be disappointed if it wasn't a bigger number as we talk next year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, great. And then obviously, you put up a very strong operating margin in Oil and Gas. You knew everybody was going to ask about that. Is this margin really a result of the Gulf Coast project starting to ramp up? And then stepping back, how do we think about the evolution of revenue and earnings in oil and gas? I mean, you did say in your prepared remarks that you see revenue will increase in the second half of '14. But should we see more meaningful sequential increases than we saw in 2Q? And when you say margin will moderate, what does that mean? Does it mean not going under 5% or can we see it lower? I know there's a few questions in there, but it's all one point to another.","David T. Seaton","I'll do my best. No, I think it's interesting. It's exactly where we thought it would be in E&C. And the reason is a couple-fold. One, as I mentioned early -- in earlier quarters, we're seeing improved margin going in the backlog, and that's a testament of what I said a minute ago about the way we are changing things to become more effective and the fact that we're being able to show that efficiencies to our customers. So that's point #1. Point #2 is we are -- there is a mix change in E&C -- or not a change, it's where we expect it to be relative to the EPC side of these projects. It's not really -- in part, it's due to the Gulf Coast but not really because in the case of CPChem, in the case of the Dow projects and in the case of Sasol, it's really in the early stages where it's engineering-only, and we haven't seen the CFM or the construction scopes go in, which typically attract a little bit lower margin. When you look at our revenue overall, it is basically what we expected because of the significant decrease in the mining business. And if you remember back 1 year ago or 1.5 years ago, a huge portion of that revenue is coming from mining. So we're kind of seeing a little bit of a shift in market. We're seeing the timing change of engineering versus construction, specifically in E&C. When I -- I don't want to give you a specific number but it is going to moderate in E&C, but I don't think it's going to drop significantly. That's probably as far as I'm going to go. So Jamie, that gives you kind of how to figure out how you're going to ask the next question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's great. And David, just a very quick cleanup. Can you tell us how much the severance costs were in the quarter, by any chance?","David T. Seaton","It's minimal. Well, I'd say it's minimal. It was a little more than $6 million.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, can you say more about the realignment, just flesh that out, which businesses maybe it impacts more. Maybe we're talking about a shared service concept there. Can you just say more about that? And you folks have certainly been very successful in your bid win rate. So can you just flesh out why the realignment at this point, given the success that you folks have had?","David T. Seaton","Well, there's not a shared services model, that's for sure. But I think what we did is we flattened the organization. And we've put some really talented people in business lines that are closer to our markets, closer to our customers and in a better position to be more fleet of foot and answer -- be more responsive to our customers. And I think that's resonating. And I think that's -- that, by and large, is the reason why we're seeing the win rates that we are because we're listening better. And we're tailoring those offerings specifically to what the clients need. But I think rapid response to those customer needs is really what's driving the success. I think if you look at the older organization, which frankly, I was an architect of with my predecessor and frankly, created some silos that weren't healthy. There was not the One Fluor mindset of collaboration and working across those business groups and business lines. And I'm pleased to see that -- say that we've made rapid change in how we, a, address the markets; and b, how we're collaborating and utilizing the entire asset of the company. So I'm pretty pleased with the changes we made and the people that are in those leadership roles.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And David, you highlighted high confidence in opportunities in Middle East and Asia for Oil and Gas, EPC conversion. I'm wondering, can you just touch on the competitive landscape in those regions? We're hearing from the Korean and Chinese contractors who are increasingly more aggressive, especially in those regions. Are you seeing that at all? Or are these opportunities projects that are so significant that it's more of a Western competitive landscape?","David T. Seaton","I think the first thing I would say is our offering and our success and hopefully, our future success is really based on the value proposition that we're developing. And I think we're doing a really good job of that, and that's why you're seeing where we are. Anecdotally, I don't believe the Asian contractors are being as aggressive. You saw what happened to the Korean contractors, and I think that the new management team would like to keep their jobs for a while. So I think we've seen a little bit of a moderating attitude relative to some of their predatory pricing decisions. But look, it's a competitive marketplace. And we continue to look for how we deal with the people we compete against and the projects we go after. So that selectivity sieve is alive and well within Fluor and I think it's paying dividends for us. I will say that in some cases, we're actively partnering with many of the competitors that we've talked about in the past, and we're finding out how best to utilize their supply chain, how to better utilize some of their abilities around technologies. And again, I think case in point is the Kuwait project that was awarded in the first quarter where you see us team with 2 Korean companies there. So I feel really good about the value proposition that we're developing and the ability for us to articulate such that our customers choose us over the competition.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in Industrial & Infrastructure, can you just say more about what you're seeing out of U.S. infrastructure projects? Any reason to get more constructive? Are you seeing bid opportunities for public-private partnerships? I know you characterize it as competitive from a landscape standpoint, but is the number of opportunities at least picking up?","David T. Seaton","I'd say it's pretty stable right now. I wouldn't say it's picking up. And just about anything that's being done in the States is being done in some variation of a public-private partnership. It is a competitive landscape. And I think one of the benefits of a Fluor is we have the ability to say no when some of these pricing circumstances happen and we don't have to take projects because that's the only market we chase. I think our diversity allows us to be selective. I think the recent action and reaction in Congress is, all in all, positive. We'll see where we go, but I think a pretty robust, comprehensive infrastructure program by the U.S. government has to be part and parcel to the infrastructure remediation in the United States. Affordable energy and good infrastructure is the basis of good economic development. And I'd say they're probably equal in value to that -- into that proposition. So I'm encouraged if we can actually get to something in Washington. And I think that you'll see some growth in that market, and I think we're well positioned to take advantage of, again, that value proposition we offer that market.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Mike Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I may not be as optimistic about how things are going to get done in Washington as you are, David.","David T. Seaton","I didn't say I was optimistic. I said if it happens, it will be great.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Okay. I just want to make sure you clarify that. In Industrial & Infrastructure, with the Mining business, are you finding the customers that are maybe starting to think about new projects or restarting older ones as prices improve? Are they looking to maybe do it themselves and go away from the EPC model? Or are the ones just waiting for their turn and then coming -- will come back to you and you'll start to maybe see some momentum in '15 and '16? How does that look?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think that we are seeing a pickup. I think I talked about last quarter and again this quarter about increased study work and FEED work in mining, which is encouraging. But if you just stay on those normal schedules, you're kind of middle of next year before you start to see the EPC projects come back. As far as them doing themselves, there may be some different models, but I don't -- none of the mining companies really invested in additional people to do what they have contractors doing in the last period of time. So I don't see that changing. I think you may see some different contractual terms. I think you may see these projects in maybe a little bit different division of scope or division of responsibility perspective. But by and large, I think the industry relies on good partners like ourselves, and I think we're starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel, if you will, relative to mining.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. My follow-up, David, would be on the power side. There's been a little bit more clarity on the regulatory front on what's going to happen with coal and natural gas opportunities and maybe even some renewables. Any more sense of an optimism that we could maybe see that market surprise to the upside in 2015 and '16 as these utilities have to start to come in with some of these orders?","David T. Seaton","Guardedly so, Michael. I think that even if you look at the EPA rules, it's still 20 years before they have to comply, give or take, completely. And I think they're still going to take time to kind of rationalize what they have. Most of our customers have to deal with a rate base, and going back to the rate base for additional money isn't something that they relish. So I think they're going to be very measured in how they go forward relative to not only the coal cleanup fees but also in terms of gas. I do think that we've got the potential to maybe surprise a little bit, a little bit, in power as we go into next year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I have to say this is the first time, within Oil and Gas, an E&C company has surprised me on the positive on the margins side and not on the top line side. But David -- but I guess, David, I've never seen in my years covering this, and I don't want to age myself, an E&C company posts such strong margins in the beginning of the cycle, and recognizing the mix factor, which I do feel you've never done this before. So my question is, is there something more Fluor-specific? You're starting to talk about the changes that you're making, and maybe you don't want to go out yet and -- because it's early on. But is there something more Fluor-specific here, whereas we think that margins over a cycle, they should increase sort of peak to peak? And then my second question as relates to the revenues. Because the revenues -- and I know Andy's sort of asked this, but the revenues on the Oil and Gas side, I think, continue to surprise people on the downside. I'll take it because your profit dollars are there. But some other contractors have talked about projects not moving into the construction phase at the pace that they want it to. Is any of that in your first half numbers? And how much of a risk is that to the second half?","David T. Seaton","I'd say none of it, none of it. And I'd say very little is at risk in the out years. On the last -- in answer to the last question first, revenues were exactly where we expected for them to be in Oil and Gas. And I think they'll build from there. We've got some very large projects still to be awarded even this year and more next year. So I believe that this cycle, as I've said before, will be larger than it was in the last cycle, which leads me to answer your first question. First, I'm not going to go into details because our competitors are pretty smart folks, and I don't want to give them the playbook. But we have made significant changes. I've talked about that in previous calls. Some of the work that Peter Oosterveer and his team took on 3 years ago are starting to pay dividends. We are -- we have changed the way we are executing, and we're using some different tools and execution platforms that allow us to be much more competitive in the marketplace and at the same time return better margins to our shareholders. So I think that we've really done some good work organizationally both in terms of oil and gas and what they've done, which relates to the margin that's there, but across the company. Some of the flattening that I spoke of and removing some of these silos that we're seeing tremendous progress in terms of that complete Fluor sale. And I feel really good about where we're headed. Specifically about E&C, I would agree with you. It is ahead of what we saw in the last cycle. As I said, it will moderate a little bit as we go through this year. And I expect strong performance from that -- from those business lines over this cycle.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess just a follow-up question, just on Kitimat. Obviously, there's been a lot of news in -- on Kitimat and what's happening with Apache. And recognizing that there's only so much that you can say. I mean, to what degree do you think there's risk that Kitimat has to be taken out of backlog, or that whatever you're assuming in terms of revenue burn isn't conservative enough? And then I'll get back in queue.","David T. Seaton","Jamie, Apache's announcement is absolutely no surprise to us. And we'll see where that goes. I defer to Chevron to really talk about where that is. But we've seen no actions that give us concern that there's a backlog issue. Clearly, if there's a sale, there might be some timing elements to it. But I still think that, that project, from a business model perspective, from a regulatory perspective, is still very solid.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","This is Chad, on the line for Vishal. Last quarter, you had mentioned that you are targeting a couple of LNG projects on the Gulf Coast. Can you give us an update on where you are in the bidding process and expectations for timing?","David T. Seaton","Early stages, probably not a '14 event.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Got it. And then on the Power side, can you talk about where you are with finding a buyer for NuScale? Is there any progress to report or any timing that we should be thinking about?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think signing -- finally signing that cooperative agreement with the government was a big step, because that basically was, in my opinion, the good housekeeping seal of approval on the technology and the fact that the DOE and the NRC see it as something that's very viable that they're willing to participate in. That was behind our schedule, which retarded our ability to attract investors. Now that it's signed, sealed and delivered and we're moving down the road, we've seen an uptick in discussions with potential partners and manufacturing partners. And I feel good about the prospects of bringing some people in as we probably close this year and get into next year.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sameer Rathod with Macquarie.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","Do you think this budding trend of exporting ethane could derail the U.S. pet chem cycle? It seems like a significant part of the ethane market, and it seems like a lot of it's going to be used for hot gas versus potential retrofit projects in Europe.","David T. Seaton","I don't, because most of -- well, the 3 crackers we're working on are specifically for downstream derivatives that fit their business model. And ethane for ethane purposes isn't what they're getting into. There could be a cracker built for export alone, but I think it's the whole value chain that our customers are looking at. And as long as gas prices are kind of where they are, or a little bit up, a little bit down, the business models still work.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","Right. I guess, just to clarify my question, the dynamic of exporting ethane, it seems like a huge part of the market. So you're not -- you don't think that will potentially derail future projects. Is that -- just to be clear.","David T. Seaton","No, I don't.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","In the release, you guys mentioned that you expect to see improvement in the number of businesses in the second half. So I guess if you could just talk a little bit about which businesses should see that ramp up in profit dollars as the year goes on and I guess why, specifically.","David T. Seaton","Well, I mean, obviously, Oil and Gas is the big engine right now. I think we will see improvement in Power. I think we will see improvement in our Industrial Services piece of our business. I think we'll see strong performance in Infrastructure. I think we'll see kind of a bottoming out and from a profit perspective, starting to rise as we get into next year in Mining. Government's still got a little bit of headwind just simply because LOGCAP IV was so large and it is shrinking. But I'm happy to say that our government guys have done a good job of starting to refill the bucket when you think about supreme -- sorry, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve win as well as Paducah. So they're acting on their strategy to fill that hole up, but that's a big hole to fill when you think about how large LOGCAP was. So in general, I think there's some puts and takes, but at the end of the day, I see a pretty bright spot relative to the next couple of years.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And just to clarify, so the power ramp-up, is that the Dominion project starting to really get to a point where it's really ramped up? And is Infrastructure sort of Tappan Zee, where you're recognizing more profitability? What's the 2 things in those particular segments?","David T. Seaton","Power is not Dominion. I think we're going to see some improvement in project intake and obviously, the profitability that comes from that. It's not going to be that much, but it is more, which is a good thing. Relative to the infrastructure, I mean, they got a lot of programs going on. They're still bidding a lot of programs. But strong performance on Tappan Zee, the Horseshoe project, some of the stuff in Europe. I mean, it's a pretty broad business, and I'm not saying it's going to be hugely increasing, but it will be a strong part of the earnings stream of the company.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then for Biggs, typically, cash flow tends to be back-end weighted. Is there anything different about this year? Obviously, it's been pretty solid in the first half. But should we look forward to another good strong second half of the year as well?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, I don't see anything different about this year, but it is challenging to predict where it's going to land in any given quarter. And remember, I had in my comments a statement that it's always influenced significantly by the timing of some major receipts, which was, in fact, the case for the second quarter. We had some large receipts come in right before the end of the quarter. So whether or not those hit right before or after the end of the year have -- can have a big impact, so it's hard to be precise. But if you kind of look through that, we expect the same kind of patterns overall this year and next and expect good strong operating cash flow performance as we go through time. I don't see a big change.","Operator","We'll hear next from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is, David, if you were to frame the restructuring and from what you've discussed on the call, does it sort of add flexibility and juice to what the industry refers to as A-team? Does it sort of expand the quality of the teams in a way?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it does. I think we've been successful. I mean, when you look at the last kind of wave, 2 of the main -- we were able to, in Mining, kind of leverage some of the talent from E&C in the last cycle. And we, in fact, had a couple of projects run by E&C project directors. And it allowed us to expand that market. I think that one of the things that really makes me feel good is by becoming more efficient, I think we've been able to quicken the cycle time, if you will, in some of these projects, which frees up teams to do more projects more quickly. So the bandwidth of the company expands, but also, I think the flexibility and agility of the company has improved because of the changes that we've made.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then my second question was in regards to a topic that doesn't get that much attention but would love an update from yourselves on the outlook, and that's really micro-LNG and maybe sort of more small scale GTLs. And I know you guys presented recently at a GTL conference where you talked about integrated GTL, with refineries being potentially more economical. Would love to see if that's getting interest from your customers.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think they are interested, and we continue to kind of look at how we can improve the capital efficiency for those customers. I think it's early stages. But I mean, when you think back when they finally figured out that if you debottleneck a refinery and put an aromatics plant behind it, you can create more profitability. And that's decades-old. So we continue to push on technologies, we continue to push on what that efficiency needs to be. But it's early stages. I mean, I think if you look at LNG, I think floating LNG is probably the next one to really move forward. But I still think that's going to take some time.","Operator","We'll hear next from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Actually, just coming back to the petrochemical commentary. Maybe just give us a gauge as to how many crackers you anticipate will be built at this point. I know you gave numbers for floating out there, maybe 5, 6, maybe 1 or 2 more after that. But around that range, I think, was kind of the consensus. Maybe if you'd give us an idea of where you see things standing today and maybe give us a snapshot of what you think the derivatives market looks like as well.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think the derivatives market will pick up. I think these 3 crackers are the ones that, obviously, had the tea leaves, right, if you will, relative to their business plan and timing. So I think we were very pleased that we were successful on those 3. The other ones, I think, are kind of on a slow roll. You've seen some people pull back on their spending on a couple of them. I still think there's a couple more to be built in North America. But I think we're probably into '15 before any significant work's done on any of them.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","That's on the second grouping into '15?","David T. Seaton","Yes, 2 to 3.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. 2 to 3. And then just separately. Just kind of on the guidance, so you kept the range. You're talking qualitatively that the oil and gas margin is going to say pretty healthy in this 5 range. Your I&I margins have been pretty solid, 6 and above. I'm not certain what -- if you made a comment about it being in the second half. But it does seem like you're trending towards the high end if the profitability does stay at these levels, if not better. Maybe just give us a sense if there's some offsets we should be thinking about in the second half that might be offsetting the profitability of the revenue in H2.","Biggs C. Porter","I do think on I&I, the margins in the first half are higher than what we would expect for the second half. There is a -- there continues to be some opportunity for them to do better than their historic average. But they certainly have done just very well related to closeout of programs, particularly in the mining business in the first half. And it's hard to say that, that's going to repeat at that kind of level. The -- I think -- so you get the big drivers of oil and gas. It is going to have revenue growth, margins will moderate. Of course, we said that last quarter and they, in fact, moved it up this one, but we do expect it to move back down, because we think those revenues are going to come in and moderate that and then I&I will moderate. So I think it's a matter of balance overall between the moving parts. Global Services, we didn't talk a lot about. David went through the various businesses. But they will be getting some headwinds from withdrawals from Afghanistan in the second half. That really hasn't hit them yet. They've been down on lower mining effort. But as the equipment gets repositioned in the third and fourth quarter, that will create some headwind for them.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Great. If I could just ask one more thing. Just on the DOE funding, so I just want to make sure, this is a matched funding agreement that you established, correct? So it's not going to reduce your spending on the program.","Biggs C. Porter","Yes, the net spending was about $50 million last year. We still expect it to be around that on a net expense basis this year. And I'll just add on to that. I mean, the ability to reduce that further would come from us selling our interest down, which as David said, we might be able to get another investor in before the end of this year, one or more, but that wouldn't likely have a big effect on this year's spend. That would be more prospective.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Connors with Stifel.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","I was just wondering on the EPS effect if the reimbursement roughly offset the R&D expense and what that number was on an EPS line.","Biggs C. Porter","Well, the expense was, I believe, around $21 million, and the reimbursement, $17 million. So yes, it was pretty much an offset for our new scale for the quarter.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And there was also, just for housekeeping, a gain on sale in the quarter of about $12 million. Can you guys elaborate that? I saw that in the cash flow statement.","Biggs C. Porter","Well, we have gains on sale most every quarter. It's pretty frequent. Our Equipment business, when we take equipment off of lease or take it off of a project and dispose of it, typically, we have gains. That's a recurring kind of gain. There's no particular reason to focus on it that I could see.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Company, Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And qualitatively, David, can you give us an update just on where Sasol is? Do you still expect that sort of 4Q and Mozambique being -- I think last time -- last quarter was about a mid-2015 event? Were there any changes to that?","David T. Seaton","No. That's about where we think.","Operator","We'll hear next from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess I want to dig in to the I&I segment a little bit more. Biggs, did you say that you expect the I&I segment to be up here in the back half of the year? Was that what you said? Was that sequentially or was that year-over-year? It sounded like [indiscernible].","Biggs C. Porter","No, we don't expect it to have increasing EBIT in the second half of the year. What you've got is really strong performance in the first half based upon Mining coming down but having great margins. We do expect to have Mining continue to be a negative trend in the second half. Infrastructure specifically, however, could be improving in the second half. But I wouldn't look for a big net move out of the combined elements.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","For the quarter, the Q disclosed that there was closeouts, like you mentioned, in both Mining and Transportation. Can you quantify for those so that we can get maybe a better sense of what the underlying margins were for the business?","Biggs C. Porter","No, I think it gets way too finite to try to differentiate the progress of the projects and how much is closeout versus how much is normal run rate. We do want you to understand that it had a positive effect, but it gets really tough to start to quantify one set of circumstances versus another and have it produce real meaning for you.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. And then, if I could, I wanted to dig in a little bit into the awards, clearly driven by the government awards this quarter. With the accounting changes that you guys did on the backlog at the end of last year, can you tell us about how much of that is funded versus unfunded?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, it is disclosed in the 10-Q, so I'd refer you to that. You can get all the proper details on unfunded versus funded. Right now, as of today, the Magnox isn't funded because of the way the funding mix business work in the U.K. But we expect that, that will become substantially funded in just a couple of months. So the way they work through the legislative process, they award a contract, and then it becomes, in this case, funded in fairly short order.","David T. Seaton","And I'll remind you that we changed to be consistent with our competitors in how we take in government backlog. And also, I mentioned in my prepared remarks on Magnox, we only took our portion of that in.","Biggs C. Porter","And also, it's consistent with how we do commercial. So government and commercial are really lined up. It's just commercial doesn't have that same hard line you can draw between what's funded and unfunded, but it basically works the same way.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes, that'll make sense. Just in terms of with some of these newer projects coming in and LOGCAP ramping down, what's your guys' outlook for the margins in that business? Is this something we've been, I guess, what 2.3% this quarter but should we expect that to head higher as we move into mobilization on these newer wins?","Biggs C. Porter","Right now, the -- within government, you've got a number of moving forces. LOGCAP's coming down, which is actually higher margin than average business. But they're also spending quite a bit on bidding and proposal expenses, which has a negative effect on EBIT. So it's going to transition over time. And I think it's premature to say what a new run rate is going to be for government. We have to watch it as the new business comes in and as it -- what's the nature of that business and what's the margin in each specific contract.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Justin Ward with Wells Fargo.","Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just -- I wanted to delve into your new awards in Oil and Gas a little bit. Obviously, new awards, in general, always lumpy. But the swing from Q1 to Q2 was, by far, the largest you guys had ever had, either up or down. In this case, obviously, it's down. Why all of a sudden you're seeing lumpiness there? Should we just kind of write that off as lumpiness? Or is there something more we could read into that as a reflection of...","David T. Seaton","I think it's just the normal lumpiness. It is a bigger number than has been traditional, but there's no hidden meaning in that. I think projects are getting bigger. And because they're getting bigger, as I've said in the past, maybe some decisions move quarter-over-quarter. We historically will see 1 or 2 big projects either move forward or move back in time relative to any given quarter. So it's nothing more than the normal lumpiness that we expect in that business.","Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then just one on the reorg. It sounds like as you guys see the benefits kind of coming through here, it's getting pretty exciting. And does that kind of motivate you to continue to push for more and more change? And is the transformation kind of a moving target and kind of what stage are we at in that transformation?","David T. Seaton","Well, we've got a very specific plan of attack relative to transformation that started 3.5 years ago. And we are exactly on the schedule that I had put forth then, which did include some of the organizational realignment. We're right on time with that. I think that some of the improvements that have been made in our execution delivery are clearly maturing. And I think that will only improve from there to make us, a, more competitive; b, more sure of our delivery in terms of cost and schedule; and c, they're absolutely aligned with what our customers are looking for relative to capital efficiencies. But I would say that -- I wouldn't say that -- sometimes I use a baseball analogy and use innings. I would not suggest that, that applies to what we're doing because we're focused on a continuous performance improvement cycle, and we're going to continue to keep the pressure on the organization to continue to improve.","Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, great. And then one more quick one. You touched on the pricing environment in the Middle East a little bit. There's been a lot of discussion about pricing may be a little bit more aggressive in North America from the Western competitors. What are you guys seeing there?","David T. Seaton","Well, I wasn't speaking specifically about the Middle East. I was more pointing towards the U.S. I mean, we've seen some really aggressive pricing in the power market and in the infrastructure market. And again, we've got the profit expectations built into what our offering is, and we'll let the chips fall where they may. But I would say that we've seen an increased competitive landscape in North America.","Justin Ward - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And I guess does that apply to the Oil and Gas as well? Or is it mostly just Power and Infrastructure?","David T. Seaton","It's all over the place. I mean, look guys, I mean, there's no time in my history in this company where I've seen the competition not fierce. And I think you will always be fierce in this business. And that's just incumbent upon us to continue to improve and continue to be cost-effective, but at the same time, make sure that we're demanding the profitability that we need to return to the shareholders as they expect.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","David, I just want to follow up for a second. What are you hearing from customers relative to peers around cost increases, either labor, materials? I mean, it seems like some of that pressure has gone away, but is there anything out there that they're talking about that might cause them to move forward with some of these projects a little bit quicker?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think that some of that is built into what we think the FID dates are going to be because I think they are wary of escalation in terms of labor and materials, particularly engineered equipment. Labor on the craft side of North America is a challenge and will continue to be a challenge. And I think we're taking the right steps to make sure we got the right answer both in terms of what the customer expects and more importantly, what we expect. When you look at the supply chain, it is robust. But frankly, on the engineered equipment items, there has been no investment in additional capacity. So I think the market is going to get tight. And I think we're just helping our customers understand what that means and take that risk into account as we help them get to that spending decision. But I wouldn't say that, that's extraordinary today versus 1 year ago or 5 years ago. I think they are a little more attuned to it because you've heard them talk about capital efficiency. And I'm glad to say that we're absolutely aligned with them in that regard.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","But based on your experience and going back in the power cycles, I mean, it seems to me that generally, that fear of cost increases causes some of them to move forward a little more quickly or urgently. It doesn't sound like we're...","David T. Seaton","Yes, I mean, I think if you just take the United States and the Gulf Coast as an example, when you take Shell's GTL plant out of the equation and you delay Sasol's to they're saying 18 months behind the cracker, that's a huge relief valve. Because those are big, big projects that are heavy in piping, which has welders and materials and pipe materials and spools and everything that goes with that, which are -- which could -- can be pinchpoints from a schedule standpoint. So you've seen the industry kind of moderate based on the sequencing of the projects and some of them going away. So I think to your point, the customers have gotten a little more comfortable with some of the decisions. But it's based on that more than any other factor.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And you don't see that changing near term? Or I mean, the next 2 years?","David T. Seaton","No.","Operator","And that concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","David T. Seaton","Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for participating on the call today. I think as evidenced by our results this quarter, you can see that our Oil and Gas group continues to perform very well and has good line of sight, and a lengthy size -- list of sizable prospects. And Government is making progress and winning a number of new long-term programs that will, in part, stem the impact of continued LOGCAP Task Order reductions. While Power and Infrastructure award levels continue to disappoint, these markets represent, I think, a good growth potential over the long term. With that, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company, as well as your confidence in Fluor. With that, I will bid you all a goodbye, and have a good day.","Operator","And again, this does conclude today's Fluor Corporation's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call.

Please go ahead, Mr. Telfer.","Geoff Telfer - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, Cade, and welcome to Fluor's first quarter 2017 conference call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after market close, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll referenced while making prepared remarks.","But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in the company's Form 10-Q filed earlier today and our Form 10-K filed on February 17.","During today's call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now, let me turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Geoff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we will review the first quarter results and discuss our outlook for 2017.","Let me get started off by addressing the guidance. First quarter admittedly got us off to a slow start for the year on earnings. That and the potential for slow burn on a couple of key projects put pressure on the lower end of our previous guidance range. The upper end of the range would have required new awards coming in at a faster pace than we've recently experienced. For these reasons, we have lowered our guidance for the year.","Having said that, I want to spend a few minutes on what we currently see in the markets and how that will drive our results for the remainder of 2017. While first quarter economic data has been relatively soft, we continue to believe a gradual recovery of our markets is underway, driven by improvements in the global economic activity. Some of the leading indicators for future capital spending like industrial production, capacity utilization are improving in several regions and industries, which provides us confidence that our clients are beginning to increase their spending.","However, the lack of engineering and new awards is unprecedented and lower than we expected to see when we initially issued guidance for 2017 last November. Let me emphasize that we believe that we have good insight into what is coming and that the opportunities remain robust. It's all about timing and how much acceleration we will see in 2017 versus 2018. Within Energy& Chemicals & Mining segment, commodity prices are supportive of investments in downstream, petrochemicals and mining, and we continue to track multiple large projects, including derivative and LNG plants in North America and downstream projects in the Middle East.","Our commercial markets, including life sciences and infrastructure, should improve going forward and we anticipate multiple awards in these industries over the next several quarters. And finally, in our MMAI business, which we are now referring to as Diversified Services, continues to win new work in North America and Europe. First quarter results were consistent with the normal seasonality we expect in the first quarter.","Now let's look at the first quarter results beginning with slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor were $61 million or $0.43 per diluted share. And the results for the quarter included approximately $30 million in unanticipated cost increases on projects in the Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, most of which are related to a gas fired-power project and $15 million related to foreign exchange expense due to the strengthening of the Mexican peso. These charges in the quarter were partially offset by favorable tax benefits.","Consolidated segment profit for the first quarter was $133 million. Segment profit margin was 2.8% compared with 5.4% last year. Excluding the negative impact of the projects and the foreign exchange charges taken in the quarter, segment profit would have been approximately 3.7%. As we had discussed last year, we anticipated that margins would come down as we transitioned from higher margin engineering to lower margin construction activities, particularly as it related to Energy & Chemicals & Mining segment. This migration is a result of the natural maturing of EPC projects, coupled with the low level of new awards over the last several quarters. This is the biggest reason for our year-over-year variance in results.","Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $2.3 billion, and our ending backlog was $41.6 billion. While I'm disappointed in our new award bookings this quarter, based on feedback and conversations we have had with customers, we believe that results this quarter represent a low point in this part of the cycle for new awards and we anticipate improvement going forward.","If you turn to slide 4, the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $817 million in new awards for the quarter, including a reconfiguration project for two refineries in Texas. Ending backlog for Energy & Chemicals segment was $20.3 billion. Of this amount, approximately $1.2 billion is in Mining. Client optimism in this market has improved over the past two quarters and we are starting to see mining clients move forward with development plans. We are receiving awards for FEED and pre-FEED work for gold, bauxite and copper projects, and indications are \u2013 that two major EPC mining projects will be awarded in the next few quarters.","Before leaving this segment, I also want to provide an update on the CPChem ethylene cracker project in Baytown. The project is now 86% complete. We are in systems turnover phase and entering pre-commissioning phase, and we remain on track to achieve mechanical completion in the third quarter, consistent with our prior performance expectations.","First quarter new awards for Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were $777 million, including the A10 Zuidasdok motorway project in the Netherlands. Ending backlog was $14.6 billion. I'm particularly pleased to see that our success in Texas continues with the award last Friday of the Southern Gateway project here in Dallas. This $625 million award is adjacent to the Dallas Horseshoe Project, which we will complete with our partner, Balfour Beatty in the second quarter.","Please turn to slide 5. The Government group posted first quarter new awards of $173 million, including a multi-year services contract and additional funding for the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant project. The ending backlog for that group was $3.7 billion.","During the quarter, the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority made the decision to shorten the term of the Magnox RSRL project in the United Kingdom. And as a result, the contract will now end in August of 2019 and we have adjusted our backlog to reflect this change. I will say that we are also preparing with our partner a bid for the next phase of this project.","The Diversified Services segment posted first quarter new awards of $546 million. Ending backlog for that segment is $2.9 billion.","Before I turn the call over to Biggs, let me provide an update on where we stand on the two nuclear projects for Westinghouse. As you know, at the end of March Westinghouse filed for bankruptcy as a result of cost escalations on the nuclear projects in South Carolina and Georgia. In conjunction with this bankruptcy, Fluor entered into agreements with both of Westinghouse's end clients, SCANA and Santee Cooper, for the one in South Carolina and Southern Company for the one in Georgia, to continue to work and be paid on both projects while the clients go through an assessment period. We will continue to support both clients in their assessment efforts.","At the end of April, both owners have asked for and received an extension from the bankruptcy court to this assessment period. Our outstanding accounts receivable and contract work in process from these projects at the end of the first quarter was $238 million, and since then we have received payments of approximately $103 million from the owners. Total backlog for these two projects at the end of the quarter was $6.4 billion in our backlog numbers.","We have secured liens on both projects as a matter of due course. Based on the combination of our liens, agreements with the owners, and the relative probability of these projects proceeding in whole or in part, we believe we will recover all of our outstanding receivables and costs incurred on these projects prior to bankruptcy, as well as going forward.","With that, now I'll turn the call over to Biggs. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 6 of the presentation. I'll start by providing some additional comments on our first quarter performance, then move to the balance sheet.","Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, Diversified Services, and Government were partially offset by a decline in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment. Corporate G&A expense for the first quarter was $45 million compared to $55 million a year ago. As a reminder, corporate G&A expenses last year included transaction costs related to the acquisition of Stork.","As previously mentioned, this quarter's earnings per diluted share of $0.43 includes a $0.15 charge on a couple of projects in the Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment and a $0.07 expense related to foreign currency losses attributable to the strengthening Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar.","I know some of you will be comparing this quarter's segment margin rates to the fourth quarter of last year. In Q4 of last year, although at the bottom line they were overshadowed by tax issues, there were positive effects of contractual matters and a foreign exchange benefit, which improved IIP and ECM margins respectively. These were offset by restructuring charges in G&A. Please keep these in mind as you compare quarters on a sequential basis.","The effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.2% driven by a stock deduction, or reduction of $0.11 per diluted share on a foreign subsidiary.","Shifting to the balance sheet, Fluor's cash plus current and non-current marketable securities totaled $2.2 billion compared to $2.1 billion last quarter and $2 billion a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $270 million for the quarter, as we continue to see an improvement in working capital. This is very positive for the first quarter, reflecting collections that otherwise might have come in last year.","We don't give cash flow guidance because of all the timing considerations of the large payments from customers and the inter-period ups and downs can be significant, but this first quarter result positions us well going in to the rest of the year. During the quarter, we paid $30 million in dividends.","Moving to slide 7, Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $41.6 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 29%. At quarter-end, the mix by geography was 52% U.S. and 48% non-U.S.","I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2017, which is on slide 8. As David mentioned, we are revising our earnings this quarter, our guidance for the year to $2.25 to $2.75 from $2.75 to $3.25 per diluted share. If we weren't off to such a slow start, we might have left guidance alone, but it seems prudent at this point to temper expectations. Hopefully this action will prove to be conservative.","You can think of our guidance revision as $0.25 for the first quarter result versus consensus and $0.25 for conservatism on new awards and revenue burn in 2017. We do not believe this conservatism should be extrapolated into 2018 and beyond.","Our guidance for 2017 assumes G&A expense in the range of $180 million to $200 million and a tax rate for the remaining quarters of 32% to 34%. Our expectations for 2017 include NuScale expenses of approximately $80 million and capital expenditures of approximately $225 million to $275 million, depending upon AMECO opportunities. As David discussed, our guidance reflects an expectation of quarterly improvement as we move through 2017.","Looking at margin expectations for the balance of the year, we anticipate the Energy, Chemicals & Mining group to be in the 4% to 5% range, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, excluding NuScale, to be in the 3% to 4% range, Diversified Services to be around 5% to 6%, and the Government business to be approximately 3%.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our first question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good afternoon, Steven.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Afternoon, Steven.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","David, could you just help us understand the dynamics with engineering here? I always thought that when customers felt a little skittish they kept the engineering going but they just didn't approve the big, new projects. So what's going on with the pace of engineering awards, especially now that commodity prices have been up from the first quarter of last year for a while now? And then you mentioned it sounds like your customers are telling you that this is the bottom, so how should we feel \u2013 how confident should we feel that this is really the bottom and moving forward it's going to be better?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I think one of the things we continued working on, as you state on engineering, is mostly pre-FEED and FEED activities. And there's a fair amount of that work in there but it's just not sizable enough to push the earnings that we expect. If I look back over the last probably two-and-a-half years on a relative basis, it's probably the lowest EPC new award total for energy and chemicals over that period that I've seen in my career. And the interesting thing is we haven't lost anything.","In fact, everything is pushed to the right where when you think about the guidance that we set last year in November, we were expecting some significant awards in the third and fourth quarter of last year that would have been really in the peak of burning their engineering scope now. We still are scheduled to put those projects into backlog in the coming quarters but, as you can see, you missed basically three quarters of earnings on those projects, or at least the ramp up, it pushes everything to the right.","There's a couple of projects that we expect in the second quarter that will start to reverse that, which is why we say, as I said earlier, first half of this year was going to be weak and the second half would be strengthening going into 2018 and 2019 where I think we're going to see a pretty significant uptick in that work. But, as I said, we haven't lost anything, it's just everything keeps moving to the right relative to those FIDs and our customers are still pretty confident about it, notwithstanding the recent drop in, say, oil price as an example. So those are some of the issues on what I would call the energy, chemicals and petrochemical.","Mining, we're starting to see a little bit better, not better \u2013 we see quicker decisions being made in the mining segment, and if you listen to some of their reports, they've started to be a little bit more optimistic in terms of their capital outlay. And notwithstanding the bauxite projects that we were awarded earlier, I see a couple of big ones, as I said in the prepared remarks, hitting us over the next two quarters.","So again, when you think about the projects that are going to come in, in the second and third quarter in E&C, the same thing that's coming in to mining, you can see why we have at least some encouragement as we look towards the back half of 2017, but more importantly into 2018, 2019 and beyond. So to me it's just purely a timing issue. We're solid on all these projects. It's just getting them to the finish line has been significantly harder than in past times.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","So just putting those pieces together, should we assume then that this quarter is the low point in the backlog and that the second quarter bookings are enough to start taking us higher? Or is that still to be determined?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, when I thought some of these projects were coming in, in the third and fourth quarter of last year, I think I said that, that was the low point. So I'm a little gun shy answering that part of the question. All I can tell you is, is that we have great insight into a significant pipeline of projects that will drive the kinds of earnings that we, at least plan for in 2017, but will continue to come in as we go through this year and again, into 2018. So I just think that the low point has kept moving. Indications are at least in Mining, that the times are changing, and I think in the E&C market the same thing applies.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess my follow-up is related to the \u2013 it sounds like there's two projects in the IIP segment. One is clearly the South Carolina power project. What's going on with that? How far along is it? What caused the issue? And what's the other project? And how big is the charges there?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, the South Carolina project is nearing completion. And there's some issues there that I really don't want to talk about because we've got some opportunities, hopefully, to maybe reverse some of that. On the infrastructure, it's one of the road projects in the Netherlands, and it's due to the inability of one of our subcontractors to perform. And I'm not sure where we are on that one but we're probably midway on that one.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. I'll turn it over. Thanks.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","That was pretty close but not quite. How are you guys doing? David, so look, I want to follow up a little bit on Steve's question about EC&M margin. We know you \u2013 when I look at the margin in the quarter, it was pretty low.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","You didn't ask me a margin question.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. So good. It's a good follow-up then. So Biggs did not change the margin guidance for the year. It's still 4 to 5%, but it came in lower than that in the quarter. We know that you talked about a lower quarter here coming in. And answering Steve's question you talked about lower engineering. Is that the big issue really in the quarter? And can you talk about your confidence on the engineering work, helping you get back in the range? Is there anything else that needs to happen? Do you need these projects that you talked about to ramp up in 2Q and 3Q and the visibility of those to get there?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yes, as I said, I think basically that is the issue, it's the timing, and we feel pretty confident in terms of some of the new awards from some of these projects happening in Q2. So that's why we have at least an opinion that the second half of the year will improve, particularly in E&C, as well as mining.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And then...","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","The margin rate for the quarter is really lower than normal because of that ForEx charges in the ECM business.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And then how do you want us to think about these new nuclear projects in the sense that we read a lot, I'm sure you read a lot, you talk with the customers, in the next few weeks and the next couple months, as you said, are going to be very important for these projects and for Fluor. I guess the question is would you ever take fixed price work on these projects? And as you move forward here, it seems like you're getting paid faster? Is that truly the case? And, again, should we be worried about these projects for Fluor or how do you feel about them as we sit here today?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","That's a great question. We are being paid faster. I think that our team and some of the relationships that we have with those customers clearly put us in a really good position and we're going to support them going through this. You've read the same things I have and I've actually spoken with both customers today as a matter fact, and they're going through their evaluation process, trying to figure out exactly where they are, look at what options are available to them in terms of their claims against Westinghouse\/Toshiba, and we're going to support them and are continuing to work just like nothing's happened at both job sites.","My guess is, is that both projects will go forward but it depends on how quickly and whether they do both units at the same time, or all four units at the same time, two at each site. But that decision is theirs to make. That's just David Seaton's opinion there. Relative to your first question, the answer is there are pieces of those projects that may be considered for a fixed price, but it's a very small component. And absolutely zero of the construction labor would I accept on a fixed price basis.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. And so when we look at the overall projects, David, assuming that they did go forward, would you say there is a chance for more work if you did some of the fixed price work, or should we just kind of wait and see what happens?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I don't you to talk about \u2013 any fixed price might be around some of the equipment we provide or something like that, but it is miniscule in the grand scheme of things.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Helpful. Thanks.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jamie Cook, Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. Good evening. I guess a couple questions. One, you guys sounded fairly confident in your new outlook, and even implied it's probably fairly conservative, but I guess I'm having a hard time getting there. Because if we take the first quarter and we adjust for the power project and the FX, and we normalize for your tax rate, that implies the first quarter ended up at $0.50 with a closeout in the Government Services business, which I don't know how big it is, but that probably helped.","So $0.50 times four is $2.00, so like what am I missing? And I know you're talking about some projects ramping. If you could provide more color, because we've been talking about EC&M revenues growing for some period of time, and they continue to decline.","And then my second question, I think you lowered your margin targets on the Industrial, Infrastructure & Power business. I'm just trying to understand the drivers behind that. Was that just the power project? A lower margin on that, or zero margin in the Netherlands project, or is related to the new projects? I'm just trying to understand those dynamics. Thanks.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Yes. So on the second question, it really is just a carry-over effect of the two projects that we talked about in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power that we made the adjustments on in the first quarter. That has the effect of lowering the margin rate expectations for the year, just from a run rate standpoint. It's not presuming anything otherwise happens with respect to those projects, but just a lower booking rate coming out of this quarter.","With respect to your first question, the way I do the math, and maybe the same as you, the first quarter actuals $0.43 if we normalize it, round it to $0.55, so that would take the remaining three quarters on a normalized basis to give us a total of $1.65. You add the $0.43 first quarter to that, then you're $2.08. You're really not too far away from the bottom end of the range obviously in doing that. And in fact, just some adjusting for seasonality in Diversified Services segment can close you that gap to the bottom.","You mentioned Government explicitly, and I'll say, yes, there were some pick-ups, but we think that there is equal likelihood of some pick-ups going forward in Government. So I would not back those out and think that those are something that's not going to happen again.","And then there's ramp-up. We expect to ramp-up before, but what basically our guidance, if you think of the guidance as applying 25%, or $0.25 conservatism on that ramp-up, we've really taken what we had applied before with our guidance and have taken it down by about $0.25. So now that ramp-up is still there, but it's a little bit more conservative. There's a variety of projects really that are already in backlog in addition to the seasonality in Diversified Services that we think can provide that ramp-up without relying upon an awful lot of growth from new wins.","So we feel once again like we've been reasonably conservative with this because if you just look at it from the standpoint of annualizing the first quarter \u2013 normalize and annualize the first quarter, looking at seasonality and looking at some projects we presently have maturing and what we think they're going to provide that we're now comfortable with the conservative range we set.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I guess just a follow-up question for David. And Biggs, that was helpful, so I appreciate that. A follow-up project for David on the new projects. Obviously, the cash flow was positive in the quarter, and then you got additional cash. So that's good. I guess I want to understand the potential for additional scope with these new projects.","It sounds like there could be, but I guess the other side of it, given the size and the complexity of these projects, there is also talk of either Southern in particular bringing on another contractor just to help get through this complex contract, these complex contracts. So can you sort of handicap the risk there? And do you think if that happened there was enough scope on the other projects to offset potentially another contractor coming in?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Oh. I think so, Jamie. If you're talking specifically about those two contracts, I feel pretty confident when they go forward, we'll go forward with at least what we had if not more regardless of them bringing in someone else. So assuming those projects go forward, I feel pretty good about that actually growing over both sites. Were you talking about some of the other new awards in that question, as well, or?","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Well, no. I was just talking about \u2013 just on Southern in particular there's been speculation that another contractor could come in. So if they take part of that contract, I just want to make sure \u2013 you know what I mean? There's enough...","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, Bechtel already had a staff augmentation contract for the last six months on both sites. So that's not something new, and I don't expect that to change going forward.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. I'll get back in queue.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Jamie, I presume you're still listening, I'll say...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yes. I'm still listening.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","I said that the guys, just to presume, really rely upon a ramp-up from new business. We of course do assume we're going to get some amount of new business. We're just not relying upon that to provide a growth to that run rate.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yes, Jamie. I kicked him under the table on that one.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks.","Operator","We'll go next to Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, folks.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Tahira.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","David, for a long time, Fluor's been the sort of blue chip name at trade shows and within your peers on the execution side. And as I look at over the last several quarters, you've had a string of different projects having some hiccups. How are you addressing that on the execution side? I think for investors \u2013 I get the cycle is something you can't control, but any color on how we get comfortable inside internally \u2013 to really get comfortable around what's happening and that it's contained going forward?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yes, sure. I think I'd come at it from two different angles. One angle is we have over 2,500 projects at any given time underway. And unfortunately, it's only the couple of them that stand out like they do. So I think from an overall health check, if you will, of our execution model, I think it's pretty solid. And I do believe that with some of the things, the changes we've made, the things we've added, we've actually strengthened that capability and gives us more confidence in terms of our ability to execute.","In the case of these, both of them were actually bid before we'd made a lot of the improvements that we had made, and in fact, I've made some organizational changes, at least personnel changes in some of those groups that are experiencing the problem. So I think management has taken the actions necessary to put the right people in the right positions. I think the overall basis of our execution approach and that integrated solution is resonating with our customers. And I think our ability to connect the dots between the traditional engineering scope, the supply chain scope and the construction scope is producing the type of predictability that we hoped for going to the future.","As I've said before, this business is cyclical but this business also has issues and problem projects. There's not one of our competitors that can say they are flawless. But hopefully as we continue to perfect our new approach, those mistakes get fewer and fewer in between. And as you'll note, both of them together really aren't significant in the grand scheme of things. They're bad and we hate having the drag but in the grand scheme of things I think we've got great capability going forward and control of our own destiny, so to speak.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, David. That's actually helpful. And just as a follow-up to that you've probably seen some headline buzz on some Middle East projects that some of your Asian peers are seeing issues with. I know you have exposure there and from what I know you're bidding on a couple of multi-billion dollar opportunities, which you are hoping could even come through by the end of the year there. So how do we get comfortable around Fluor's risk ownership and sort of profitability around what's happening in the Middle East?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I'm not sure how I get you comfortable but I'm comfortable. I've had specific reviews on both the CFP project and the Al-Zour project in Kuwait. I feel good about where we are and the reason I feel good about where we are is because that is one of the first projects, at least CFP, where we've applied all of our new learnings to. Al-Zour as well but we're further down the road on our scope on CFP. And what I see is very encouraging in terms of our ability to deliver that project within our expectations in terms of costs and schedule. I know there's problems on that job site. I've been on that job site many times. I would argue that in a lot of ways, the scopes are apples and oranges. And we feel good about where we are on the scope that we have.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, David. That's pretty helpful. Thanks a lot.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Tahira.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","Good evening, gentlemen.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Hey, Michael.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hey, Michael. How are you?","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","Well, thank you. David, after witnessing in the past 30 months, as you indicated in your comments, the most amount of new business and activity in your career, I could understand why you're hesitant on timing and deferrals and when customers make the decisions. But can you remain confident or even give any more confidence on the magnitude and the pace and the opportunity in say 2018, 2019 and beyond, given all this pent-up demand and pressure that could be leading towards your business flows once you get through this new term headwind?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Michael, I think, I see lots of the same prices we've talked about in the past, and I'm confident in our position on those projects. And as I said, it's just kind of pushed towards the right. I do believe there's several very large projects that will be awarded in the energy and chemicals space to us in the next few quarters which obviously starts to fill the bucket for 2017 and 2018. But in the conversations I've had with customers, they all agree that they waited too long. And now they're scrambling to try to get some of these programs back off of the drawing board, so to speak.","And we're in those discussions. We feel really good about the fact that we have not only the traditional customers that we dealt with in oil and gas and some of those traditional approaches, but we're also seeing significant growth in our non-traditional markets outside of the United States taking all the kind of EPC work that you would expect that Fluor to be able to execute on. So I'm cautiously optimistic, and hence, why we lowered the guidance for the year that we could see some quarter-over-quarter slippage still to come. But most of these customers are telling me we can't wait any longer, in mining that both customers I'm speaking of basically said, we've got to get moving.","All the indications are positive in terms of their decisions. And then there's a fair amount of big projects that are in the bidding cycle right now in oil and gas and petrochemicals that give me confidence that as we get into 2018, 2019 I think we're going to see a significant ramp-up. We've got to be careful in that because what I don't want to do is take on too much and maybe fail one of these customers in terms of our ability to deliver on cost and schedule.","So the projects are out there, we see them. This isn't a situation where we're scratching our head trying to figure out where the second half of that number comes from, and those are good, solid projects with good, solid customers that we have longstanding relationships with. But it's just frustrating for us. As I said, the guidance we gave was based on the information that came from September and October of last year, over six months ago, and all indications were that some of these projects were going to go to FID and come to us.","We still think they're coming to us but I'm just a little nervous based on that history that says okay it may go to the third quarter and therefore we don't have the earnings that we expect if the project was awarded in the second quarter. So as Biggs said, there's some conservatism in that new range but the markets are there. Customers are ready to spend again, and I would argue that we're as prepared as we've ever been to take advantage of that and take advantage of the entire supply chain of those projects, not pieces and parts like in previous cycles.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","I appreciate your thoughts. Maybe just quickly to follow up. It seems like you've gotten some very good news on infrastructure. Can we see more of that visibility over the next 6 to 12 months, especially as some of these bonded issues and some of the California stuff that was just signed into a law a couple of weeks ago starts to show up into the flow?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yes, those were good things. It was bad for \u2013 some people to say it's good things to get new taxes but it does free up some of these projects to go forward. The projects that were \u2013 they're winning right now is very encouraging. As I've said in the past, I believe, at least in the United States, a lot of the projects in infrastructure that are going to go forward are going to be in the $200 million to $300 million to $500 million kind of range. And what we've proven is we can be competitive on those projects and we're far enough along on some of those smaller projects to know that we've got a good execution model that delivers the expectations that we have for them.","So I think over the next little while you're going to see more and more of those kinds of things. I'm encouraged by what I'm being told and the conversations that I'm having in Washington in terms of what they're trying to do, but a lot of these bigger programs have just got a long gestation period. And I hope that the administration and certainly the Secretary of Commerce, Secretary of Transportation, set in place the platform that make these programs and projects more accessible, removes the undue regulations that are there, and I hope they get that done over the next little bit of time so that as we get towards the back half of Trump's four years here, first four years here, we're starting to see some of these bigger programs come to light.","But I think it's going to take some time. But as I said, the encouraging piece is the things that are there are of that level that are really good because I'd like to have eight $250 million projects than one $2 billion project. And I think that, that's encouraging in terms of our ability to continue to grow our capabilities in that market but also broaden the geographic reach that we have in that market.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","David, I think investors want all those projects for you, but I appreciate your thoughts. Thanks.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hey, I want them all too, but I'm not \u2013 just to continue on that, the good thing about the smaller projects that I've always held dear is that's where we train our next wave of people. That's why Fluor I think is seen as an employer of choice. It's because we have the projects that give this next wave of people opportunity to show what they can do. And that's why I think we've got the depth of bench that we enjoy and why we're able to broadcast that bench across market and across geography. So I'm pretty bullish on some of the unintended consequences of the market that's available to us.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","Thanks, David.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good afternoon.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Hey, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","David, in your prepared remarks you mentioned that you expected to get paid on your work for Westinghouse if the project move forward. What's your view of the risk of the projects not moving forward? How feasible is that option in your view? And in that scenario, what would your recovery look like?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, we'll be paid for everything, including the costs prior to the customers taking direct contracts with us. So I don't see the receivable being at risk at all. In terms of handicapping those projects going forward, it's really too early to tell. And the reason I'm on a hedge on that question is I don't know what a bankruptcy court is going to rule on. I have a feeling where both customers are in terms of the range of costs that they can take and the schedule associated with it.","Congress was extremely unhelpful across the board in terms of the production tax credit extension. I hope some of my political friends are listening in because they failed us in that regard. But I think that it's feasible that both projects can go forward but I think the schedules are a little bit in question. But as I said we're still working like there's no change on both of those sites and are continuing to make I think good progress on those two projects. But Southern Company's got a bigger balance sheet than the combination of SCANA and Santee Cooper. So you've got a little bit of a different gradient there but the conversations that I've had in both cases have been encouraging relative to being able to move forward.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And, David, you folks have made a lot of progress since moving on the site. The last published assessment of timing with 2019, 2020 on the nuclear projects. I'm wondering if you can weigh in on, based on the work that you folks have done, what do you think is reasonable as the projects move forward?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I'd prefer not to weigh in on that because again both customers have got some decisions to make and I don't want to get out ahead of them in terms of what those scheduled dates are.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And in mining, you mentioned two major project opportunities. Can you talk about the size of the projects that you're pursuing? And has it widened that outside of the bauxite area where you've had a couple of awards?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Can't really talk too much about them but they're significantly large projects and neither one of them are in bauxite.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","All right. Thank you.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Rob Norfleet with Alembic Global Advisors.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. Close enough. Good evening, guys. And, David, congrats on the Gamecocks making it to the final four.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","How about my national championship girls?","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Absolutely. That's why I was waiting to see Frank Martin on the board.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Go Gamecocks. That was a great year. I tell you. I happened to be in New York for the Sweet 16 and got to see them beat Baylor in the Garden, which is just like the Mecca of basketball. It was so exciting. So thank you for that lead-in.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Absolutely. Just a couple quick questions. I guess, first of all, starting this year I think everybody was somewhat skeptical about additional ethylene work or ethylene crackers getting built. Clearly, we've seen, in North America, a couple of awards already as well as some downstream derivative work. So I guess I wanted to get your thoughts around North American petchem activity for the remainder of this year. It looks like pricing on the side of ethylene and some of these other spot commodities certainly supports investments.","And then you made a few comments on LNG. And again, I clearly realize it's really about offtake agreements at this point, but it sounds like you're seeing some green shoots there. Maybe you could just discuss some of the opportunities?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, on LNG, it's onesies and twosies. It's not a market movement yet, because the supply demand equation hasn't been balanced and therefore there aren't the contracts that you're speaking of. So we're participating in a couple of things, and I think there's some stuff, but I don't think it's going to impact backlog or earnings before 2018 or even into 2019.","So I think there's going to be a little bit of study work, maybe a couple of projects go into a limited notice to proceed. But clearly there's some political issues that have to be dealt with in some of these places before those projects go forward.","I think on the North American refining petchem market, I think there's a good growth story there. We are seeing \u2013 all you've got to do is look at Dow's and DuPont's releases and what they're doing from a profitability standpoint. There almost at all-time highs, which shows you that they feel confidence in continuing to invest. And it's not just those two, it's across the board.","So I think we're going to see crackers coming on at least into the new award range in the near term. I think the downstream derivatives follow that, but I also see refining being part of that equation. And I think it's going to be interesting, because I think there's going to be some non-U.S. investors that are putting money into the U.S. Gulf Coast and other parts of North America, which bodes well for us because most of those customers we've always had longstanding relationships with. And I feel good about those kinds of things. But I think you're going to see some direct foreign investment in the United States that'll drive some of those projects forward at maybe a more rapid pace than maybe we anticipated when I said that there would be a lull in crackers for a couple of years before picking up again. I think that might move forward a little more rapidly.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Okay, great. And just quickly can you give us a little bit of an update on NuScale? I know, obviously, we've submitted the design certification to the NRC. So maybe walk through what the next steps are? And then secondly, where are we relative to finding a partner or kind of a JV to kind of help shoulder some of the expense of the program as it moves towards commercialization in the next few years?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, one of the things is we did submit on time. One of the other good things is the NRC actually docketed it within the 60-days period that they have, which tells us that all the work that's been done to date with the NRC and the DOE shows that they believe this is a viable technology and something that has promise for the future.","I think one of the next things that we're looking at is what does the U.K. do in their selection of going forward with small modular versus the big nukes? And that'll be an interesting thing to see. Clearly that's going to have an impact on whether we have new investors or not, but we're clearly going to focus on getting the design certification and preparing for that first project that we hope is in Idaho. But we'll see where that goes. But we're going to continue to push and see that we get that design certification.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. Thanks so much, David.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","As additional comment on the U.K., they're supposed to make -their play is to make a selection on what SMR technology they would adopt. And we're the only ones supported by U.S. Department of Energy and the only one actually in development at this particular point in time. And they're looking at committing $350 million to SMR development. It doesn't mean it all goes to the technology developer but they've got funds out there. We'd like to get additional funds also from U.S. government over time.","In terms of new investors, all these things, hitting these milestones makes it much easier to go and get other people interested and move along those lines. But I don't want to commit to a timeline there, but the success we've had, in terms of getting this technology to this point and docketed in 60 days, which is unprecedented. Usually it takes nine months, a year. It's just an indicator of the strength of our position and that's, obviously, going to bode well in terms of getting other people interested.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","All you got to do is go back and look at how long it took the NRC to actually give the design certification on the AP1000 and how long it took to docket that. I think this shows that we've got a good mouse trap and the people that are in that industry are happy to see it developing at the pace it's developing.","Robert F. Norfleet - Alembic Global Advisors LLC","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Oh, great. Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good afternoon.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey. So, Biggs, I just had a couple of numbers questions, actually, and this is in response to Jamie's questions earlier. So the clean number is $0.55. So I want to understand how you get there. I got $0.43 reported. You've got about a $0.10 tax benefit. That's $0.33, plus about $0.07 from the charge and another $0.07 from FX. That gives me $0.47. Where's the other $0.08?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Okay. What I've got, there's the foreign exchange is $15 million pre-tax, charge $30 million pre-tax and the tax is $15 million, which is after tax number and I get that to about $0.11 net.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","On the charge?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","No. Net-net, all things.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'll have to do the math again. Can you quantify the government closeout and\/or the Magnox contribution that we should be looking at in 2019? I do recognize you're rebidding that and that makes all the sense in the world but just to have an idea of what the impact for those things would be helpful.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","I'm sorry. Give me that one again.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","The question was first on the government closeout, what was the magnitude of that closeout in the quarter? And then follow-up question in government was what's the EPS contribution, or revenue contribution from Magnox on an annual basis?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","We wouldn't grind down to an individual project but that project is going to go on through 2017, 2018 and into 2019. So I wouldn't be modeling it distinctly anyway, plus they're still very happy with us. It's not about whether or not we're performing satisfactorily so we're in a good position to continue work even after that contract ends in its current form. It's kind of a technicality as to why they have truncated it in 2019. It's really not about anything related to our performance or the structure of the work.","In terms of the magnitude of the closeout, there were a number of things in government which contributed to their margin performance in the quarter. It was good performance on some projects and really at some lesser degree a settlement of a contingency. I wouldn't pick at any of them and say, okay, I'm going to normalize for that because as I said to Jamie earlier, I can identify equal amount of upside on other matters for government for the remainder of the year.","It gets really finite to go into it, on a more detailed level than that, I'm just trying to give you some comfort that if it were me I wouldn't be trying to pick it apart and trying to figure out what to normalize out.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","That's a fair point on the closeout and thank you for the very fair point on Magnox and your role there. Undoubtedly from everything that's been reported you guys have been doing a good job and this is much more on their end than on yours. Okay. I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, Andy.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Seaton for any additional or closing remarks.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, and thank you to everyone for participating on our call today. As I said, although we're disappointed on where we are at this point in 2017, all indications are that this is unprecedented contraction in the capital spending of our customers and that it is coming to a close and optimism is there.","Our industry has always been a late cycle industry and this cycle is no different. One of the questions I'm sure you're asking is if 2017 is the trough, what does that mean for 2018? And my answer is we've seen enough of these projects that have been delayed in FEED, delayed in the FID. Those decisions are being made or beginning to be made as we go through 2017, which is driving our growth expectations for 2018.","Unlike many industries, engineering and construction can't create a market around a new product. Instead, there's an expectation that we innovate, refine and develop our abilities in a down market so that we're ready when our markets and clients return and make those spending decisions. I'm absolutely confident that the changes we have made and we've gone through in this down cycle we've made our company more capable, more resilient and more innovative, and we are ready for this late cycle phase to end. And all indications are that, as we move towards 2018, we'll be in a much better position.","We greatly appreciate your support of Fluor and I wish you a good evening.

The web replay will be available for 30 days. A telephone replay will also be available through 7:30 PM Eastern Time on November 6th through a registration link, also accessible on Fluor\u2019s website at investor.fluor.com.","At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Jason Landkamer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Landkamer.","Jason Landkamer","Thank you and good morning. Welcome to Fluor\u2019s third quarter 2019 conference call. With us today are Carlos Hernandez, Fluor\u2019s Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Steuert, Fluor\u2019s Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this morning and we have posted a slide presentation on our website which we will reference while making prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I\u2019d like to refer you to our safe harbor note regarding forward-looking statements which is summarized on slide 2. During today\u2019s call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information.","There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company\u2019s Form 10-Q filed earlier today and our 10-K filed on February 21st. Our 8-K was filed this morning however due to [Indiscernible] issues it has not posted.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts to the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now I\u2019ll turn the call over to Carlos Hernandez, Fluor\u2019s CEO. Carlos?","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you, Jason, and good morning. Thank you to everyone joining us today. Before we discuss our quarterly results, I want to quickly reiterate the changes we announced on September 24 as part of our strategic review and operational review.","If you would please turn to slide three; last month we committed to a plan to sell substantially all of the government and equipment rental businesses. Starting today we will be reporting those business lines as discontinued operations.","We also created a segment called \"Other\" where we will keep our two fixed price government contracts and NuScale. We're also splitting our Mining, Industrial Infrastructure & Power segment into two standalone segments; Mining & Industrial and Infrastructure & Power.","The actions we are taking over the last few months reflect the reality of our industry. We continue to act with urgency and have undertaken these changes to strengthen floor and put the company on a path to deliver consistent and profitable growth. As a result of this product I believe we have a better understanding of our backlog and have confidence that backlog can positively drive future results.","Now turning to our segment updates. If you would please turn to slide five; with the third quarter new awards for the Energy & Chemical segment were $256 million and ending backlog was $13.7 billion. Ending backlog reflects the removal of the Wanhau chemical plant complex in Louisiana that was booked earlier this year and canceled by the client in the third quarter.","New awards for the quarter primarily reflect the timing of clients FID decisions and are not the result of our revised pursuit criteria. We are committed to following a clear criteria to pursue the right contracts with the right terms. And we believe our new pursuit criteria will help us derisk the business and deliver higher margins.","One exam of a project that fits our new criteria is the Rovuma LNG project in Mozambique. Fluor and our joint venture partners, JGC and TechnipFMC were awarded a limited notice-to-proceed earlier this month.","This fourth quarter award allows the joint venture team to progress on the project until the final investment decision is reached in early 2020. This project is aligned with our updated bidding standards announced on last quarter \u2013 last quarter's call. We work closely with our consortium to develop a project model that appropriately leverages each party's strengths and capabilities.","We also held a number of meetings with the client over the last several months to reach an agreement on items that were critical to derisking our execution profile. Like LNG Canada we have a good relationship with strong partners that have deep experience in the LNG space.","We're going to continue to work in lockstep with our partners to deliver project that meets our requirements for safety, productivity and profitability. As we look to the fourth quarter and early 2020","Our Energy & Chemicals prospects include several significant reimbursable projects around the world. These include the Formosa Sunshine petrochemicals mega complex in Louisiana, a project in China for INVISTA, and an ethylene oxide plant in Europe for BASF.","Let's turn to slide six. The Mining & Industrial Group reported new awards of $119 million in the third quarter and ending backlog was $6.2 billion. Mining EPC awards for 2019 continue to track our expectations from last year as we continue to work on FEED and feasibility studies for large mining EPC project that we expect to be awarded in 2020 and 2021.","Now turning to slide seven; the Infrastructure & Power Group reported new awards of $2 billion in the third quarter and ending backlog was $7.7 billion. New awards included the addition of the Texas DOTI-635 East project in Dallas as well as the I-26 North Carolina DOT project outside of Asheville.","Segment profit of $1 million reflects our execution on lower margin projects that experienced forecast revisions in the second quarter. Now looking ahead we are pursuing additional road project in Texas and remain confident and the strong prospects from our Fluor Heavy Civil Group.","Let's turn to slide eight. Our diversified services segment reported new awards of $260 million and ending backlog was $2.4 billion. This segment excludes AMECO North America which has been moved to discontinued operations. Restructuring of Stork continues to progress on schedule and we anticipate this business will deliver improved results in 2020.","Turning to slide nine; the other segment includes our two fixed-price government projects; Radford and Warren and our investment in NuScale. As highlighted in our strategic review, we reported $79 million in charges this quarter relating to the Radford and Warren projects.","These charges reflect additional cost growth relative to our initial estimate, engineering changes and unapproved change orders. The charges taken today reflect our current cost complete estimate.","NuScale expenses for the quarter were $14 million, but I do want to point out that Fluor did not provide funding for NuScale in the third quarter. We expect to receive another tranche of funding in the fourth quarter and are actively engaged with additional investors.","In discontinued operations which includes our government and AMECO North America businesses we reported earnings of $40 million or $0.28 per diluted share in the quarter. Government business was successful in winning contract extensions for Savannah River and Idaho National Laboratory. Our plan to divest these businesses are progressing well and we expect those sales to be completed within one year.","And now, I'll turn the call over to Mike to talk through financial results from the quarter and outlook. Mike?","Mike Steuert","Thank you, Carlos and the morning everyone. As you can read about our results for the quarter in our earnings release and 10-Q that we hope to file this morning, I will focus on several key matters.","Please turn to slide 10. Our continuing operations, earnings attributable to Fluor for the third quarter were a net loss of $782 million. Results for the quarter include the following items; a non-cash charge of $546 million related to establishing a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets.","$290 million in non-cash impairment charges related to our Fab Yard in China, our investment in Stork and our joint venture with Sacyr. $44 million in restructuring activities and $79 million in project adjustments on two government projects that Carlos just talked about.","All these items are consistent with what we communicated on a strategic and operational review call last month. As it relates to the adjustment of our deferred tax assets I want to again point out that while we remove these assets from our balance sheet for technical accounting reasons they are still available to Fluor for tax purposes.","This higher than anticipated tax rate this quarter is due to the company being impacted by this valuation allowance and certain foreign charges that could impact tax -- could not be tax benefited.","Corporate G&A for the third quarter was $10 million compared to $61 million a year ago. G&A expense is lowered due to reduce compensation accruals and favorable foreign exchange adjustments. Last month, we announced our plan to reduce overhead by $100 million. That plan is underway and we'll provide update later this year.","Shifting to the balance sheet, please turn to slide 11. Fluor's cash plus marketable securities for the quarter were $1.85 billion slightly below last quarter. Our available domestic cash improved from last quarter and now represents 28% of total cash and marketable securities.","The asset impairments that we took this quarter are all non-cash. In addition a portion of the restructuring charges for this quarter and going forward also non-cash. Cash utilized by operating activities for the quarter total $25 million. We used approximately $70 billion in cash to fund the loss projects in the third quarter and expect to fund roughly $250 million in the fourth quarter.","As announced on September 24, yesterday we declared our new quarterly dividend of $0.10 per share. This dividend reduces our cash usage by $15 million per quarter and aligns payout with other similar dividend paying companies.","We remain focused on rebuilding our balance sheet and are confident that our financial flexibility will be further enhanced as we complete the sale of government and equipment rental businesses. These sales along with monetization, surplus real estate and other non-core investments are expected to generate excess of $1 billion in aggregate proceeds.","And now, if you turn to slide 12, I'll conclude my comments by talking about our outlook for the fourth quarter. Although the company's suspended guidance for 2019, we anticipate margins for the fourth quarter to be 4% to 5% for Energy & Chemicals, approximately 2% for Mining & Industrial, again approximately 2% for Industrial & Power and 4% to 5% for Diversified Services.","I also want to point out that Energy & Chemicals margins in third quarter positively affected by closeouts which resulted in margins higher than that were expected in the fourth quarter. We are currently reviewing our operational plan for 2020 and we expect to issue 2020 guidance for the full year at the end of call in February.","With that operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. I guess the couple of questions. One, as we sit here a month later relative to your strategic outlook call. If you could just comment on your view on the health of the backlog and whether we've properly understand like where the risk is in the backlog and risk of incremental charges going forward?","I guess second, on the asset sale given some of the transactions that have been announced since you announce the decision to sell the government business, sort of where we are in the process and whether you're more optimistic? And then last, Mike, understanding you don't want to give long-term guidance or guidance for 2020 yet. Is there any help you can give us sort of on cash flow, how long the problem projects burn on the cash flow? When we expect cash flow to be positive outside of asset sales and cash from operations I guess? Thanks.","Carlos Hernandez","Good morning, Jamie. I'll take the first two, and I'll ask Mike to take a third one. With respect to the backlog, as you can see this quarter we took couple of charges -- charges on a couple of government projects which we had indicated we expected to do that. With respect to the rest of the portfolio, our estimates have been holding very well and I'm very optimistic that, while we can't guarantee that we won't have charges in the future. We've gotten our arms around the backlog and are very -- feeling very, very confident about where we are there.","With respect to the transactions, it's very early in the process. But I can tell you that there is significant interest with respect to both businesses. We've got \u2013 we've engaged investment bankers for both businesses. We got a list of interested buyers and we'll be progressing that very promptly. We're probably a little bit further ahead on the rental business, but we expect to close both transactions probably no later than mid 2020 and we're very positive about how those are going to progress. Mike?","Mike Steuert","Sure. Jamie, let me talk about cash flow. First, as we look at the charges that we took in the second quarter and some of our loss projects. We did experience modest outflows in the third quarter. We will have some outflows in the fourth quarter and through 2020. Most of those -- the vast majority of those projects will be well along their completion path by the end of 2020. So we expect to address -- see all that. But at the same time, we are working on improving underlying operations and expect to have positive cash flow from the rest of our businesses.","In addition, as you mentioned we're working on asset sales. We're also working on selling a lot of other non-core investments or other assets that will positively impact cash flow and we have some claims and some other assets on the balance sheet that we hope to monetize over the next year as well. But I would not point yet that we can really break it out with the amount of affinity that I'd like to and perhaps we will in February. But I am cautiously optimistic that we'll some -- net of all the other special items, we'll see some positive cash growth throughout the latter half of 2020 and as move into 2021.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful. I'll let someone else to get in.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Mike Steuert","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Carlos, can you step back and talk about the booking environment as you see it. You didn't book much in E&C in the quarter. And I think you mentioned the cancellation in your prepared remarks. But during your strategic review you suggested that Fluor's overall backlog to be flattish in 2019. With the understanding that you've removed government and AMECO from continued operations, have your expectations for backlog changed a bit given the cancellation. Are you seeing any incremental delays on project awards?","Carlos Hernandez","Well, we have seen a little of a delay. We had indicated earlier that Rovuma project was delayed to probably the second \u2013 first or second quarter from the final notice to proceed. But I think the new awards for 2020 as we're looking at now will be fairly consistent with what we said. It's going to be fairly flat to 2019 with the exclusion of \u2013 obviously, with the exclusion of the government and AMECO businesses. But we're pursuing several big reimbursable projects and E&C is pretty optimistic about those. So I can't say that we're seeing a lot, lot of growth, but we're not going to see much deterioration either.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks for that color. So then, when you look back, it seems like you impaired most of the investments that the previous management made over the last several years with the notable exception of NuScale. So, at this point do you see any risk of further impairments? And then, when you setback it seems clear that Fluor needs to improve the way it invest its cash. So how do you take that lesson and move forward? To you do fewer JVs? Do you do something different than integrate the delivery model? What do you do going forward?","Carlos Hernandez","Well, I'll let Mike answer the question as to whether we anticipate future impairments. But you're absolutely right in terms of our investment experience. We're going to be much more cautious in the future with respect to our investments. We pursued a strategy of getting into fabrication and that strategy is a valid strategy, but we haven't had the success at the yard that we expected as early as we did. We are expecting now that the LNG modules will be released to that yard in early to mid 2020. So that yard, we expect will be performing better than it has in the past.","With respect to the Stork investments, we probably paid more than we should have for that, but we're restructuring now and it's going to be performing at a higher level in 2020. So yes, we've made some investments that may have been better made, but we're dealing with them right now. And we're not going to be making investments in the future that don't have a rigorous review in terms of its potential or its expected return. Mike, you want to talk about impairments.","Mike Steuert","Sure. We did take a very close look at impairments and the majority of impairments were regard to the fab yard in China and we had a modest impairment on stork. And as Carlos mentioned our outlook for both of those \u2013 for both fab yard and stork is improving as move to the remainder of this year in 2020. We definitely think our impairments are sufficient for those and I wouldn't expect any further impairments.","As you move forward and generate cash, I don't think you're going to see us making similar investments. Our priorities for cash are to rebuild our cash balance, strengthen our balance sheet, and then of course return cash to shareholders as we get to a healthy balance sheet and a healthy cash position. But that's how we look at currently Andy and we certainly at this stage do not anticipate any further impairments.","Andrew Kaplowitz","All right. Thanks guys.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning, guys.","Mike Steuert","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Fisher","Good morning. The E&C margin in the quarter and the forecast were better than we expected. And I know did cite some closeouts. But is the Q4 rate kind of the starting point for 2020? And how should we now think about the trajectory of the margin in that segment?","Mike Steuert","I think you could at high level say it is a starting point for 2020. But again, we're going to be going through a very detailed review of 2020 as we close out this year. And we will feel much better about providing digital guidance in February. But we are pleased with how the businesses are performing as we exit this year and are going to setting fairly high expectations for performance in next year.","Steven Fisher","Okay. That's helpful. It seems like infrastructure & Power profit dollars will still be pretty immaterial in the fourth quarter, but you are putting some new big projects in there like the I-635. So, until LNG Canada and some of the other big energy projects ramp-up, is this going to be the swing factor segment for overall profitability you think? And how long will it take for that segment to start showing a more normalized margin which I assume should be more like the mid to upper single-digit?","Mike Steuert","It's going to take a while for the loss projects that we took in the second quarter to burn through backlog. But as we exit 2020 moving to 2021, I think you'll start seeing a much more of a return to normalized margins. We\u2019re very pleased with I-635 award. We have a great track record with Texas DOT and we think that's going to be a real big contributor as that moves forward. In addition, the other activities will again be moving out of backlog as we go forward throughout 2020.","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. Let me just add something to that, Steve. We've got now almost 20 projects in the infrastructure business, which is a very healthy number of projects and some of those have been around for while and some of those that are ones that are not delivering the margin right now, but as we work our way through those, I think we should expect improve margins as Mike indicated.","Steven Fisher","Great. And then just lastly, Mike, I wanted to follow-up on the cash flow question that Jamie asked. If you can quantify it, are you thinking that the net burn through the first half of 2020 will be a bit less than you were thinking a few months ago?","Mike Steuert","On a net basis, yes, I've been pleasantly surprised over the last couple months of the cash generating capability of our ongoing business if you take away these loss projects. We certainly have been as an organization throughout focus on cash flow generation. I just see us generating a fair amount of cash from that as well as from collecting cash from other non-core assets and investments that we're really scrubbing our balance sheet.","Steven Fisher","Terrific. Thanks a lot.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes. Hi. Good morning everyone.","Mike Steuert","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","I'm wondering if you could just expand on Rovuma LNG. So, congratulations on the contractor selection. Where we've had issues with them with projects in the past has been either a function of timing overruns, issues getting change orders approved or engineering design issues, and so as it relates to those three pockets of risk if will, can you just talk about how you folks have been able to mitigate those issues within the bid for Rovuma LNG?","Carlos Hernandez","Well, first of all, we'd mentioned in the past changes we've made in our selectivity of pursuit criteria and clearly the Rovuma project met all that criteria. We have two very strong partners in that project; JGC and TechnipFMC have significant experience in the LNG arena. We have engaged in discussions with our customer for a number of months now in derisking the project. We've had high-level conversations with that customer with respect to what's happened in the industry in general as far as the allocation of risk having been disproportionately shifted to the contractor. And so it's been a very, very cooperative process.","There are certain risks in a project that we have not taken. I can't go into detail in those, but there are some risks that's been \u2013 that's remaining with the owner. In terms of schedule, in terms of productivity this is a stick-build project and were going to -- we feel very confident that we have addressed all the risk issues here. So it's going to be a matter of showing you, but I am extremely seemingly positive about this project. And we are \u2013 and so our partners. So I'm looking forward to it.","Jerry Revich","And obviously, we know your background, Carlos, in terms focusing on terms and conditions that we were just trying to build there our comfort level around timing in particulars, so when we seen cost of runs in terms of productivity and labor hours, it's been in part due to a function of type project timing. So, can you just talk about that particular aspect of the contract structure if you won't mind?","Carlos Hernandez","Sure, not at all. Obviously, one of the key issues in these projects that or any project that we have struggled with in the past has been where we've had inadequate schedule. And that is part of our criteria now that we're not going to agree to a schedule that's overly aggressive. And in fact that has actually caused a project for us to be cancelled by the owner because we wouldn't agree on what the owner wanted for its schedule.","In Rovuma the way we have structure that contract is that the risk lies with the party that's best able to manage the risk. For example, the client is responsible for in country risks. We're not going to \u2013 we're not responsible for security, but of course we are responsible for our people's security. And we're not going to mobilizing on to the site until security is in place and it is at an acceptable level. There is a robust force majeure definitions, including all places where the work has been performed not just in country. And we have procured subcontractors, Tier 1 subcontractors with a proven track record and have appropriately allocated risk to them. And as I mentioned earlier the project really meets our pursuit criteria.","Jerry Revich","Okay. I appreciate the color. And then in terms of on the infrastructure project opportunities we've seen a couple of companies stepping away from the larger projects because of inadequate risk terms on multiyear infrastructure projects. Can you just talk about your assessment of the market environment and what your opportunity set looks like? Do you agree with the assessment from a few of your competitors and partners?","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. One of the differences between some of the competitors that have exited the mega infrastructure, P3 or other large infrastructure projects is we do have the capacity and the balance sheet to take on those projects. But we're not going to take on projects for example, where we don't have the right team to execute. We have -- we just recently walked away from an opportunity because we didn't have the right team. I think that there will be plenty of opportunities in infrastructure especially as we complete the existing projects and in the geographies where we have said we're going to execute infrastructure projects where we're going to be able to get work for example in our heavy civil business which is a business that's construction only for smaller projects in the $100 million to $200 million dollar range.","Typically, we have we have a couple of opportunities where we're going to be doing those on a unit rate basis, taking out quantity risk. So I think we're well-positioned in infrastructure, but we're not going to get ahead of our skis and take more work than we can execute effectively.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Dudas","Good morning gentlemen. Carlos, when you're looking at the projects that you're waiting FID on and from the risk standpoint that you renegotiate or rethinking about it for, how do those contracts that are waiting for award, how does that fit in relative to what was done, because those were probably looked on quite a bit in the past. And then what are you telling your sales folks or your operating folks relative to the new level of projects that you're bidding in the next \u2013 now till the next six to nine months. How much differently are those changing? Is that like making you look at different parts of the energy market, different parts of the mining market relative given the risk mitigation you're trying to portray through the organization? Thank you.","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. With respect to that the projects that we're waiting for FID on such as Rovuma. That project, as well as actually the LNG project did meet the existing or the new criteria in terms of contract negotiations. Obviously, those projects being as significant as they are, they received a tremendous amount of scrutiny and we addressed all the issues. We either mitigated them. Negotiated them out or properly price them in. What we're telling our salespeople is what I'm telling our salespeople is, look, we're going to pursue excellence in execution and that starts at the bid, no-bid stage.","We're not going to bid a project that we don't think we can execute effectively. And we're not going to take terms conditions that unduly put risk on us. And we're not going to agree to schedules that we can't meet. And this change and approach to a more risk balanced approach has taken very well within the organization. We now have -- when we reviewed projects, and every significant project comes to review to myself and the corporate management team. We have a list of the criteria and every project proposal or every package checks off whether the criteria is met or not. And that's now standard operating procedure in view of projects. So the message has been delivered and well received and I think it's going to serve as well.","Michael Dudas","I appreciate that Carlos. And just a quick follow up. In Infrastructure & Power that segment you have now, what's the power part of that business?","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. Good question, Jerry. That's basically\u2026","Michael Dudas","That will be Mike.","Carlos Hernandez","I'm sorry Mike. I'm sorry Mike.","Michael Dudas","Okay. Thank you.","Carlos Hernandez","That's basically running off the power projects we have warranty \u2013 we want some warranty issues, but you're right. There's not any substantially new, any new business in power. We do have power services business but that resides in a diversified services segment.","Michael Dudas","Understood. And final thought is back to your comment on the new process. Is that reducing the project funnel that you anticipate to be looking out over the next several months as well?","Carlos Hernandez","It probably will reduce it a little bit, but not in a significant way. We are \u2013 one of the things we also do is we're also chasing. We're going be chasing more mid-cap type of work which we had moved away from. We had done almost not exclusively, but largely after mega projects. And some of that mid-cap work will be reimbursable. So I think overall it's not going to have a huge impact on our backlog.","Michael Dudas","Thank you, Carlos. Thanks Mike. ","Carlos Hernandez","Thanks Mike.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Sangita [ph] for Sean. Thanks for taking the questions. I just want to ask on the favorable resolution that you talked about in the mining segment, if you could quantify that for us maybe?","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. That was a longstanding dispute that we had with a client and have been in arbitration for several years. That was actually the result of what we had really pretty favorable or balanced terms and conditions. And that is in \u2013 I think in the $25 million to $30 million range.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's very helpful. Thanks. And as we think about your long-term free cash potential 2020 and beyond, how should we think about your CapEx for your continuing operations?","Mike Steuert","We're going to have very modest CapEx going forward for continuing operations. Absent the AMECO equipment rental business, most of our CapEx is really going to be to support our IT infrastructure and our office buildings and we just see modest requirements there going forward in terms of investment. So it is not going to be a material part of our cash flow equation.","Unidentified Analyst","So we should -- should we think about it as less than half of what you have now, which is like $200 million-ish?","Mike Steuert","It's much less than half.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thank you. And my last question on the government business that you have up for sale. I understand that process is ongoing and you can't share much. But can you let us share with us how you think? Whether it's going to be one large transaction? Or are you seeing multiple buyers than it could be broken up into pieces?","Mike Steuert","That, to some extent, is going to depend on the nature and value of the offers. But I suspect it's more likely they're not going to be one transaction.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, great. Thanks so much. That's all for me.","Carlos Hernandez","Let me correct something I said. I think I told you 25 to 30 for that resolution. Actually I think it's more in the $20 million range. I was thinking of something else.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That's great. Thank you.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Please go ahead your line is open.","Michael Feniger","Hey guys. Yes. Thanks for fitting me in. Just on the mining side you guys highlighted how you're encouraged about 2019 \u2013 2020, 2021. I'm just curious if you talk about the strikes going on in Latin America. It's been a lot in the press. Are you hearing anything of how that could impact the pipeline? How customer conversations are progressing given that backdrop?","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. Mike at this point, that's not really impacting. We're basically doing FEEDs and feasibility studies. Obviously, we have some projects ongoing as well. But at this point it's not impacting our visibility into the future in an adverse way.","Michael Feniger","Fair enough. And following the strategic review I'm just curious if you guys had any time to reflect that how this business without government services, how we should be thinking about free cash flow conversion going forward, the balance sheet structure going forward and with the proceeds you're going to be getting I mean, why wouldn't we see any notable buyback to like maybe offset the dilution there? I'm just curious how you guys are thinking about that following the strategic review?","Carlos Hernandez","That's a great question. We do see the cash flow generation capability of the business going forward remaining fairly solid even with the sale of government and American Equipment. American Equipment was not a significant cash flow generation capability the way that was managed and way we invested it in new equipment. Government was a solid cash flow generator, but our remaining businesses are as well. So we don't see a significant change in profile. As we look at the proceeds that we're going to receive from the sales and our $1 billion was a conservative estimate. We're all optimistic we can we can do better than that.","In addition, we're optimistic with what we can do with [Indiscernible] some of other assets. Clearly as we improve our cash position. As we reduce our debt to what we think is appropriate level to remain solid investment grade, our next priority is returning cash to shareholders. And if we get to the point that we're comfortable with our balance sheet, comfortable with our cash position and we see some excess proceeds, we will definitely consider share repurchase.","Operator","We\u2019ll l now move on to our next question from Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Unidentified Analyst","Hi. This is Kevin on behalf of Chad. I just had a quick question on the bidding environment for oil and gas. Has the lower risk model that the company adopted changed the conversation with customers? And if so, how does the project funnel changed?","Carlos Hernandez","We've been having Kevin since May 1. We've been having conversations with our major oil and gas customers precisely about this issue of the bidding risk environment. As you know there have been a number of players in the space that have left the oil and gas because of the environment that has existed for several years. Our customers understand that they get it. They are now telling us, look we need Fluor to be a successful company and we got to understand, we got to work together to derisk projects. And we've already seen some of that and some of the projects that we've talked about.","So, we're not you know lump sum is not going to go away, but a balanced lump sum is going to be the model for the future it has to be. We are -- one of things we're doing now on a lot of projects is we're starting out as a reimbursable cost during the design phase and once we have designs substantially complete and the vendor data substantially procured then we're in a very good position to lump sum the balance of the project. And that's something that we've found some -- a lot of receptivity from the clients on.","So, there will be projects we will walk away from, for sure. But as I said earlier, I think that overall we are in a very positive position in our industry because of our ability to execute the large projects, our relationship with our clients and the fact that others are not capable of managing risks as we will be able to do so.","Unidentified Analyst","Got it. Thanks. That was helpful. I'll pass it along.","Operator","And our next question comes from Justin Hauke from Robert W. Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Justin Hauke","Hi. Good morning everyone. I've got another 2020 question, but hopefully this one's a little bit more quantifiable. Just on the corporate and G&A expense, what -- that was pretty stable for several years running 45 million, 50 million a quarter with the restructuring and you're assuming that more normalized comp next year. What level of G&A do you think is kind of the run rate for the business with the divestitures?","Mike Steuert","It'll start out on the $45 million to $50 million range and our expectation is as we implement these cost reduction programs that we announced as well as some other adjustments that are in line with divestitures that it will gradually decrease throughout the year. All the cost reductions will take effect at one fell swoop. But our initial pass through that process has identified a lot of opportunities. They're not all going to reside at the corporate level. A lot of them are going to be reside in the business units. But we do we do expect a gradually reduction of corporate G&A throughout 2020.","Justin Hauke","Okay, great. It's helpful. And then just, what was the size of the Wanhua debooking? Maybe we have that but I didn't think you quantified it?","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. That was about 500 million [ph].","Justin Hauke","Great. Okay. Thank you very much.","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Hernandez for any additional or closing remarks.","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you, operator.

Please go ahead, Mr. Lockwood","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thank you very much, operator. Welcome, everyone, to Fluor's Fourth Quarter and 2011 Year-end Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Steuert, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. ","Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after the market closed. We have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making our prepared remarks this afternoon. ","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information, and there is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of those risk factors in our 10-K, which was filed earlier today. ","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures as well. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are also posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com. ","With that, I'll turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon to everyone, and I appreciate you joining us here today. Today, we'll be reviewing our results for the fourth quarter and the full year of 2011 and discussing our outlook for 2012. ","If you'd turn -- now we'll turn to the financial results and ask you to turn to Slide 3. I want to start by covering some of the highlights for the performance for 2011. I'm pleased to report that Fluor had delivered -- has delivered another year of strong new awards, double-digit backlog growth and earnings per share at the top end of our expectation for 2011. Net earnings for 2011 were $594 million or $3.40 a diluted share, which compares to last year's $357 million or $1.98. Consolidated segment profit for the year was just over $1 billion, which compares with $621 million for 2010. ","As you know, last year's segment profit was impacted by the significant pretax charges on 2 infrastructure projects, as well as the power project. Our results for 2011 reflect a substantial increase in the profit contribution from Industrial & Infrastructure segment, along with very solid performance from all the other 4 business segments. ","Consolidated revenue for the year totaled a record $23.4 billion, which was up 12% over last year, mainly due to strong growth in the mining & metals business line. We also had another strong year for new awards at $26.9 billion, reflecting substantial mining & metals volume, as well as sizable orders within the Oil & Gas segment. Consolidated backlog rose to a new year ending high of $39.5 billion, which represents a 13% increase from a year ago. ","Our full year cash flow generation from operations was significant, which enabled the company to return cash to our shareholders through the repurchase of over 10 million shares in Fluor. I'm also pleased to report that the board recently approved a 28% increase in our quarterly dividend to a new rate of $0.16 per share. ","If you'll turn to Slide 4, I want to comment on the fourth quarter of 2011. Net earnings for the fourth quarter were $153 million or $0.90 per diluted share. This favorable result was mainly driven by a marked improvement in segment profit, which rose to $279 million in the quarter, again driven primarily by strong performance in our Industrial & Infrastructure segment. Net earnings for the quarter also benefited from a lower tax rate, which reflected the favorable resolution of various tax issues and audits. Revenue for the quarter was $6.3 billion, which was 19% higher than last year and again, mainly due to the Industrial & Infrastructure group. ","Fourth quarter new awards were $4.3 billion, including awards of $2.5 billion in Oil & Gas, $947 million in Power and $504 million within the I&I segment. While our new award numbers for the quarter is somewhat below levels experienced over the last 6 quarters, I\u2019d remind everyone of our regular commentary on the inherent lumpiness of quarterly new awards. We expect new awards in the first quarter of 2012 to strengthen. ","If you turn to Slide 5, I'd like to take a moment and address the Greater Gabbard Wind Farm Project. Despite additional weather delays in the quarter, we continued to make good progress, and the project's now 97% complete. We've nearly done everything but the burial of some of the remaining inter-array cables and the completion of the installation of the second half of the third main export cable. At this point, all 140 monopiles, transition pieces, wind turbine generator sets are installed, and many of the units are generating power for the customer. We have just one set of wind turbine blades left to install, and we should complete that task within next week. ","We have completed the installation of the first half of the last export cable, as I mentioned, and expect to be underwater laying the second half of this within days. This had been a tough project, but I feel good about where we stand. While we took a small charge in the fourth quarter as we refined the estimates to complete the remaining tasks, we still expect to complete the project in the first half of 2012. ","Turning to Slide 6. The Oil & Gas segment had new awards of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter, including $1.5 billion project for Syncrude Canada Ltd. to provide project management services for the Mildred Lake project in Fort McMurray. The quarter also included incremental scope on ExxonMobil's West Qurna, a development project in Iraq, and the Oil & Gas backlog rose 6% from a year ago to end 2011 at $15.1 billion. ","We continue to work on numerous front-end programs in Oil & Gas and expect that number -- a number of those projects will proceed to full EPC over the next 12 to 18 months. Our scope will obviously vary depending on clients contracting approach, but we feel very good about this segment and the continued level of FEED activity. ","Now the Industrial & Infrastructure segment posted fourth quarter new awards of $504 million, including incremental releases on mining projects in Africa, Australia, South America, the United States and Canada, quite diverse if I say so. The group also posted awards in our manufacturing and bio technology group, which included a biofuels demonstration plant. ","The mining & metals group business line also continues to work on a number of FEED contracts, and the commodity markets support ongoing capital expansion. We expect 2012 to be another busy year for the mining & metals business line, especially as we get into the second half of the year. Ending backlog for our Industrial & Infrastructure group rose to a segment record of $19.6 billion, representing a 16% increase over 2010. ","Moving to the government segment. The government bookings for the fourth quarter were modest since the timing of releases of the LOGCAP IV task orders was a little out of sync with our quarterly reporting schedule. Despite recent indications from Washington that it's considering altering our -- the U.S.'s mission in Afghanistan by the end of 2013, we don't expect to see any material change in our scope throughout 2012 and 2013. Ending backlog for government was $1.1 billion compared to $751 million a year ago. ","Our Global Services operations and maintenance business booked $140 million in new maintenance contracts and renewal of existing contracts. We expect that when the economic picture improves, it will have a positive effect on these markets and the release of major maintenance capital funding of clients. We look for improvement for Global Services as we go out through 2012 and beyond. The ending backlog for this group was $1.9 billion. ","The Power segment had strong fourth quarter bookings, its best quarter in over 4 years, with awards totaling just under $1 billion at $947 million. The fourth quarter included an award from the Lower Colorado River Authority to build a 540-megawatt gas-fired combined cycle power plant in Texas. And the quarter also included awards from Arlington Valley Solar Energy, a member of the LS Power Group, for the engineering, procurement and construction for its new 125-megawatt solar photovoltaic facility located in Maricopa County, Arizona. ","As evidenced by their success in the last 2 quarters, our Power group's prospect list is improving and will continue to do so. The new pollution control guidelines, currently under court stay, should also create significant additional opportunities as we get into 2012 and beyond. Power segment backlog rose to $1.8 billion, reflecting the strong new awards in the second half of the year. ","With regards to the outlook for our large -- larger markets, we have a robust prospect list in I&I, particularly in mining and in Oil & Gas. Our mining clients continue to invest in major new developments, as well as expansion programs, and there are some really sizable infrastructure projects that could move ahead in the latter part of this year. ","In Oil & Gas, we've seen some large prospects delayed during 2011, but we expect 2012 new award levels to improve. Regionally, the Oil & Gas group's opportunities -- opportunity is broad, including prospects around the globe: Australia, Canada, Middle East, Kazakhstan, Asia, Mexico, South America \u2013 I mean it's really broad and diverse from a geographic perspective. ","In summary, we feel really good about our results in 2011, and the breadth of our market opportunities give us encouragement as we look to 2012 and beyond. ","With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mike Steuert and ask him to review some of the details of our operating performance and the corporate financial metrics, as well as our financial outlook for 2012. So Mike, I'll pass it to you.","D. Michael Steuert","All right. Thank you, David, and good afternoon. The detailed results for each operating segment can be found in our earnings release and in our 10-K which we just filed this afternoon. ","Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. As David mentioned, Fluor's consolidated backlog increased year-over-year to $39.5 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 15% at year-end, with 78% of the total backlog for projects located outside of the United States. We continue to experience robust international markets, with the year at 84% of new awards coming outside the U.S. with a concentration in Australia, the Middle East, Latin America and Canada. ","Moving on to corporate items as shown on Slide 7. G&A expense for the year was $163 million, which compares with $156 million a year ago. The effective tax rate for the year was 30%, and as David mentioned, our tax rate benefited from several items in the fourth quarter, including the favorable resolution of various disputes and audits. ","Shifting on to the balance sheet. Our consolidated cash and marketable securities balance totaled $2.8 billion at year-end, up from $2.6 billion a year ago. During 2011, the company generated $890 million in cash flow from operating activities and repurchased $640 million worth of Fluor shares. We also paid out $88 million in dividends, and as David mentioned, the Board of Directors increased the quarterly dividend from $0.125 per share to $0.16 per share beginning in the first quarter. ","In addition, the company took advantage of the attractive markets and completed a $500 million offering of 10-year unsecured notes to enhance our cash balances in the United States. ","Capital expenditures for the year were $338 million, which compares to $265 million a year ago. This increase was driven by our AMECO business line, which purchases construction equipment to support both Fluor and third-party customers. In summary, Fluor's financial position continues to remain extremely strong. ","Finally, let me conclude by commenting on our guidance for 2012, which is shown on Slide 8. We believe we are well-positioned within our diversified markets to enable the company to continue to grow. But at this time, we are mindful of the continued economic uncertainty at this early stage of the year. With a solid backlog and a promising prospect list, we are maintaining our 2012 earnings per share guidance in the range of $3.40 to $3.80 per share. As previously indicated, this range includes an estimated impact of approximately $0.20 per share for the ongoing funding of R&D expenses in the NuScale Power activities. ","Our 2012 EPS guidance assumes G&A expense in the range of $160 million to $180 million, capital expenditures of approximately $300 million and effective tax rate of 32% to 35%. ","With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","David, as you scoured the globe looking at your prospect list, could you maybe talk a little bit about, maybe you can break it down into Oil & Gas and I&I, the competitive landscape of the certain areas of the world or certain end markets that are more competitive as the competitive aspect eased a bit? And do you anticipate that as more FEED coming to EPC that could help potential booking margins as we move into 2013?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think the competition is still pretty keen in most parts around the world. I think the real positive aspects that I see is that beginning wave of FEED work, and that's usually based on a value proposition, not necessarily on low price. So I'm encouraged with the opportunities that are in front of us. And as you know, we like to do a very good job on those front ends and help them kind of go into EPC, and I think that same practice is available to us. I'm seeing -- if you kind of walk around the globe, the mining group is still looking at their projections of commodity needs out into '13, '14, '15, which says that these capital programs need to be pretty active right now in order to accommodate that. So we've seen some pauses, but we haven't seen any real dramatic change in the growth opportunities for us in mining. Within Oil & Gas, those are really the 2 that you want to talk about. We can talk about the others as well, but in Oil & Gas, it's pretty diverse to be honest with you. We're seeing a lot of upstream projects that are going into the EPC phase. We feel really good about the growth opportunities during '12 in that particular segment. But we're also seeing the return of the refining projects, and in fact, there's 3 specific projects that we're pursuing very, very keenly. And we feel pretty good about winning the front ends on those. And I would say that even though it's very competitive, it's not as competitive as it was, say, a year ago. But it's also not as attractive from a margin percentage perspective as maybe it was in the '08, '09 kind of time frame. So it's good profit dollars for us, and we feel very good in that market. Also, I think we're working on several front-end projects in the petrochemical market. And again, it's good to see both refining and petrochemicals kind of starting to resurge, if you will.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Excellent comments, David. My follow-up question is regard to, there's been a lot of interest in activity or thought process about the United States and the opportunities in energy, given where natural gas feedstocks are. Can you talk about how Fluor is looking at that market? And also, you mentioned Power had a very good year. Do you see some more plant betterment opportunities second half of the year, as opposed to the first half?","David T. Seaton","Yes, I'll hit the Power group first, and then I'll go back. Yes, we see the second half of the year because they've come up with different tweaks and changes to some of the compliance types of projects, so there's a little bit of re-studying that's being done, and we're participating in a fair amount of that. But once the legal challenges are behind us, I do see that the environmental compliance programs are really starting to provide benefit to us. And as you say, it will be kind of back-end loaded, but I think it really bodes well for earnings streams when we get into '13 and beyond. With regard to the U.S. just capital markets in general, I attend several kind of industry groups and forum -- leadership forums around, and I think the overreaching attitude is one that the U.S. is going to remain flat and 2012 is going to look like -- a lot like 2011, and I think I agree with that. However, I think that there's a lot of bright spot when you think of gas pricing right now and the benefits that, that provides for the chemical and petrochemical markets, as well as the fine chemical markets. We're already very active in a couple of instances in scoping efforts and real conceptual studies, but gas pricing at the levels it is right now makes it competitive with the products that are being produced in the Middle East. You've got a lot of petrochemical and fine chemical assets in the United States that have been starved for capital for some time, and that's right up our alley. I mean, I feel very good about our position in that market and delivering what the customer wants at a very cost-effective -- in a very cost-effective manner.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","2 questions on margins. One, David, on the I&I side, the margins you had this quarter, again, were fairly good, I'm assuming, driven by mining. Can you talk structurally if this is sort of the 4.5% range? Is that how we should be thinking about the I&I margins going forward? And also, I guess, I'm just trying to think about profit dollar growth as we get into later stages of the mining projects. And then my second question relates to Oil & Gas margins. I mean, how much of the margin is improving? Is it a function of just burning more revenue to better utilize your people versus just booking higher-margin stuff in the business? Because, I guess, I just -- I look at your backlog today, it's sitting at $15 billion. It's higher than where we were in '06, and into '07. We had much better margins, and I'm assuming what you're going to say about 2012. So I'm just trying to think about what you view is a major catalyst of driving those margins forward? And to your more bullish comments on refining and petrochem, does that change the longer-term margin mix, I guess, more favorably?","David T. Seaton","Jamie, let me -- I want to answer it in general, and then I'll talk specifically about mining and then Oil & Gas. If you look at our mining group and you think about the Oil & Gas group and mining today, Oil & Gas maybe in the '08, '09 time frame. You had a pretty significant suite of projects that were in differing phases of execution. So the earnings streams weren't dependent on one project in the normal curve of heavy engineering content in the beginning and a lower content of construction hours in the back end. So what you've got is you've got a better balance within mining than we've seen in the past, which I think supports margin that's consistent with what you're seeing right now. I don't see it improving dramatically, but I also don't see that the typical drop-off of just having one big mining project like we had, if you go back in history a decade. So that kind of is the underpinning, I guess, what I would say, to pretty solid earnings within that segment. Within Oil & Gas, the same dynamic, I think, is reemerging where we're seeing a lot more activity in FEED work, we see a lot more projects moving into EPC, which provides us that leverage that does provide for margin improvement within Oil & Gas. So I think that what we're seeing is just we're coming through that cycle. And I see improvement as we go through '12 and into '13. There's some big projects out there that we feel really comfortable about that are going to start to churn as we get into 2012.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then David, last quarter, you did talk about the ability for you in total to grow backlog in, I think, in 2012 relative to 2011. Is that still your -- is that still how we should be thinking about things and are the Oil & Gas awards more second half-weighted versus first?","David T. Seaton","I think what I said before was that, again, the lumpiness word, that quarter-over-quarter, we may see some drop in backlog, but by and large, it's improving, I think, the quality of earnings in backlog. So we are seeing improvement in that. I do believe that durring 2012, we'll see growth in our backlog. But as you see the mix, you're going to see probably more front end, which on a per dollar -- per hour basis, is pretty attractive, bottom line margin, but it doesn't drive the EPC values in backlog. At the same time, you're going to see a ramp up in the revenue burn from the mining sector. So all in all, we'll see some marginal increase, but I think what you're going to see is an improvement in the quality of the margin in the backlog.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz with Barclays Capital.","Alan Fleming - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Alan Fleming standing in for Andy this evening. I wanted to ask you a little bit about the government revenue. I think you've talked about most of the other segments relatively in depth. But the government revenue seems to be bouncing around in the kind of the $800 million to $900 million range. Wondering if you could just give us some color and how we should think about modeling this business, specifically has Portsmouth kind of fully ramped up? And how should we think about that going into 2012?","David T. Seaton","Well, let me give you a long answer. It's a book-to-burn. I mean, it's a quick book-to-burn-type business. So backlog in government is somewhat meaningless in comparison to say, mining, Oil & Gas, Power, any of the other groups. So the fact that it bounces around really doesn't concern us. It's what's kind of in that -- those task order releases and the like and the renewals like for Savannah River and the like. We've got a good strong earnings stream there, and when you think about the budgeting process that's going on, we don't -- we really don't anticipate any significant change in the number of people working in Afghanistan, on LOGCAP or anything else in the near term. In fact, if you look at Iraq as a model, people like us increased our headcount in earnings during the period after somebody set a date for departure. So we really don't see any change in the base earnings of government throughout 2012 and '13.","Alan Fleming - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then if I could follow up on 2 specific projects in I&I. First is Greater Gabbard, seems like some better news this quarter on the project, 97% done. Is it safe to say you're kind of through the woods on that project? And then on the new Minas Conga Project, can you give us an update there? Are you guys -- any updated thoughts on when you could potentially resume work?","David T. Seaton","Sure. On Greater Gabbard, we're almost done, and as I said, we've only got one set of blades left to set, which really completes the use of some of the real heavy expensive marine assets, so that really makes us feel confident. And as I said in my earlier remarks, we should be done within weeks. With regard to the export cable, it's actually the third export cable which is required if they're absolutely turning in 100% in a high wind circumstance. We've got the second half of the third one yet to do. And again, that's with -- they're on the water hopefully within this week based on weather. The only issue with the blade is, wind is the limiting factor because obviously, those blades are built to pick up wind, and it gets kind of interesting when you're trying to hang those things in high wind. But I feel like we're getting close to the end. A major expense from a capital cost perspective is behind us. We feel very positive about the quality of the work that we've performed, and we're pleased that our customer is enjoying the benefit of the power we're producing and fulfilling our obligations under that contract. So I feel really good about where we fit, where we see ourselves on Gabbard, and it's in line with what we've been signaling and talking about for probably the last 4 quarters. With regard to Conga, obviously, there's some labor unrest. We kind of had to take a breath and help the customer with the resubmittal of some of their permits, that is ongoing. And we feel that sometime during the middle of the year, we'll be back engaged, assuming that the permitting process goes as is currently planned.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I just had a couple of questions. Number 1, we've seen DOE gets funding for helping out with the R&D expenses for SMRs. So I would love to get an update from you on where you stand in terms of NuScale potentially getting some funding there and what the time frame could be if it is successful in terms of you folks getting some of that money. That's question #1. And then question #2, if you look from the brief glance I've had through your 10-K, you did mention a breakdown for us. Some of the benefits you had in I&I from second wind, et cetera, but that's for the full year. Could you talk about whether there was anything specific in the fourth quarter that we should count on or whether this was normal growth of the business?","David T. Seaton","I'll take the first and then I'll ask Mike to take the second half of that question. With regard to the DOE and the FOA that we're going after, we're encouraged by what appears to be an acceleration by the government to get this funding in place for the technologies that are seen to be the most feasible. We feel very confident in being a participant in that. And we're encouraged, again, by what the DOE is trying to do. Now whether that translates into action is yet to be seen, but we feel confident that we'll know something sometime during this year. And we believe that we'll be part of the process and part of the R&D of the next wave of technologies. So Mike, I'll let you answer the other question.","D. Michael Steuert","Right. In terms of the fourth quarter, there really wasn't anything worth noting that was specific or that you can really point to in terms of special items within I&I. It was just another good quarter and some more solid margins in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to follow up on NuScale. Can you just give us an update on where you stand with trying to sell down your stake in that?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think what we're trying to do is focus on the technology development to support the application process. We're not eager to sell our position down unless someone's eager to come in at the level that we expect from a return perspective. We feel very comfortable with where we are right now, and we're focused on FOA and design certification activities.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, because I thought you were targeting, say, midyear to try and take that stake down a little bit. And I noticed that the impact is $0.20 rather than a range, so I didn't know if you're just taking the midpoint or if you think the top end isn't likely anymore.","David T. Seaton","We looked at the budgeting process and kind of what we think it'll take to get the FOA, and that's kind of how we got to a specific number. We thought that by giving a range, we kind of didn't give you what you wanted, so we decided to dig a little deeper, and that's what we think it'll cost to get to the next phase.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then you mentioned that Q1 awards are expected to strengthen. Can you just elaborate on what segments are driving that? And is it based on what you've already booked?","David T. Seaton","Some of what's happened over the last 4 weeks -- but I think there's a fair amount of positive projects that have moved quarter-over-quarter that are at the point where they will be released by the customer, a couple on them ones that we know we already have, but there's political situations that are driving the delay in the announcement. But we do feel good about first quarter new awards.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Any particular segment commentary related to that?","David T. Seaton","I think Oil & Gas is clearly one of those areas.","Operator",".","We'll take our next question from Scott Levine with J.P. Morgan.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So can I ask about the U.S.? We've seen the Power business strengthen here in the last couple of quarters with awards a bit, and I think you highlighted potential for some large infrastructure projects, not sure if you said where. But we have seen data improve a little bit here recently, folks getting more optimistic on the Highway Bill. Are you feeling a little bit better about the U.S. potentially or not really and with things -- with an election year that we're not likely to see much improvement?","David T. Seaton","I fall down on both sides of that discussion. I mean, I want to be optimistic, and there are certainly signs that things are improving. But with an election year, it's not too hard to be pessimistic as well. We do see a lot of front-end study work going on. We do see some procurements in the infrastructure space beginning to gain momentum. I think with regard to infrastructure, I would suggest that, that's more of a back end of the year kind of prospect. And I'm cautiously optimistic that the U.S. is going to get their act together. I mean, look at Power as an example, they're just finally getting to the point where permits are being released. But in some cases, there's renewable energy projects that make absolute sense and fit the rhetoric of the United States, and then you end up with lawsuits around property rights. So there's a schizophrenic situation going on relative to some of the aspects of Power right now. But I am guardedly optimistic about the U.S. And as I've said in previous, if the U.S. starts spending at all, it's upside for us. So I'm really hopeful that we've got better news from a resurgence in capital spend in the United States.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And maybe as a follow-on and related as well, I mean, do you see the improvement that you've seen the last couple of quarters here in Power to be sustainable? And does that bode well for growth prospects in '13? I think you said last quarter that Power's in February [ph] expected to have revenue decline in '12?","David T. Seaton","I think we're going to see some lumpiness in Power because of some of the things that move quarter-to-quarter. My belief is that before we really start to see growth in Power, it's more of a end of this year, early next year, which obviously bodes well for us from an earnings perspective, as we go into '13 and '14. So again, the diversity of our market and geography focus really helps us moderate cycles over the total business.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joe Ritchie with Goldman Sachs.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","So I guess my first question is really around your commentary on backlog staying flat. It sounds like, if I were to summarize, the FEED activity is going to be strong this year, but you are increasing your burn rate on the mining side. So perhaps, David, you can comment on your confidence on that backlog level staying flat based on what you're seeing on your pipeline today.","David T. Seaton","I'm very confident it will stay flat and grow. I mean, I think you're going to see increase as we get into the back end of the year. There's some significant projects where the decisions are in the third and fourth quarter. Now I'd caution that just like any other year, you can find things in the fourth quarter that, because of an approval here or a change there, it pushes into the next year. But I see us growing backlog marginally. But again, I think you're going to see an improvement in the quality of the earnings coming from that backlog as we go towards the last half of this year and into '13.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful commentary. And just a clarification for the projects that you think could hit potentially in the second half of the year. Are you guys already working on those projects in either a feasibility standpoint or on FEED work for those projects?","David T. Seaton","Some of them, yes.","Joseph Ritchie - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. I guess one last question. One of your competitors had a recent acquisition announcement earlier this week. Has your view on M&A changed at all? Your cash balances are still -- you still remain very strong. Just love to hear your updated thoughts there.","David T. Seaton","That's an interesting question. Our focus on acquisition hasn't changed. It's niche in nature, and it's one where it fills a hole or improves a skill set. If you're talking about the URS acquisition, I think that Halliburton and KBR are in a better position to answer the question of that particular acquisition. We're an engineer, procure, construct and maintenance company, we're going to maintain that focus and grow in those capital markets. And if acquisition gives us an entry to a market within that scope or gives us a different trajectory on skill set, then we'll look at it. One of the issues that we've mentioned in previous discussions is, because of our diversity and size, it has to be niche in nature because some of the bigger ones, it might fit a niche that we need, but there may be redundancy. And I'm not interested in paying $1 for $0.80 of value, if you know what I mean, because being able to sell off pieces and parts of a service company are very difficult. So I think you'll see us be very prudent. We're going to look at smaller niche acquisitions, again, that help us move into some regions where we're not as big and as capable as we want to be or where it strengthens a technology offering or a market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Will Gabrielski with Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","On the Conga project, I'm just curious whether or not that had any impact on your guidance, if it was a negative offset, so maybe something that got better. But given that you booked it in Q3 and now you're not expecting maybe to ramp up until back half, did that, in any way, impact the guidance at all?","David T. Seaton","Mike, you want to cover that? My quick answer is, not really.","D. Michael Steuert","That's exactly right, David. It really didn't impact our guidance. But there are so many pluses and minuses in a quarter, and that were just one of them.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then the guidance, is there any guidance you can give us within that guidance on what level of buyback we should be assuming as part of that guidance?","David T. Seaton","You want guidance within guidance?","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Yes, sir.","David T. Seaton","No, sorry.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","That's fine. It sounds like you're -- or maybe I'm misreading this, but a little more confident on the mining margin or I&I margin going forward, as opposed to it maybe trending down a little bit and maybe holding these levels. Is there something that's giving you more confidence in what that margin can look like through maybe 2013 at this point?","David T. Seaton","Well, as I said, I think it's the mix of projects and the layering effect of having multiple programs going on at the same time, which I believe kind of provides a little more stability longer term. So I mean, whether it's up or down a little bit, I feel pretty good about kind of where we are.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. I was just wondering if something had changed from last quarter. And then lastly, on the services business. And I guess, the commercial and industrial data seems pretty positive, and I'm just wondering, still running well below peak levels and understandably so, but what the trajectory could look like in that business over the next year or 2 in the sense you're getting from your end markets right now?","David T. Seaton","Well, as I said, I think we're seeing the large capital maintenance budgets being funded, and in some cases, they're getting pretty large. It could end up being mid-cap projects, which, again, is something that we do quite well. But I see that market improving, and that will be, I believe, the first part of the improvement in the United States. But I think our maintenance organization has done a really good job of shifting overseas and working very favorably in places like Qatar, the Philippines. So they've been able to grow outside of the United States and not be as dependent on that major shutdown turnaround kinds of scopes. And at the same time, they refocused on facility maintenance, which has more of a stable earnings flow over a longer period of time. So I think they really did a good job of kind of changing their model to meet the market without giving up that muscle that you need to do those major maintenance capital programs and shutdown turnarounds. So I think you're going to see improvement in that market as we get into the back end of the year.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And if you'll give me one last short one on West Qurna. Do you think the pace of awards can now stay maybe at a healthier level through 2012? Or do you think it will still be lumpy quarter-to-quarter?","David T. Seaton","I think it's going be real lumpy.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Just a little bit, to my path [ph], just to get a sense on I&I awards. Am I correct just to think about the pace of awards? As sort of you talked about the pause in mining awards. So does that mean that in absolute terms, mining and I&I awards have sort of peaked, and we're just going to hit the steady rate for a while? Is that the right way of looking at it?","David T. Seaton","I'm not sure I would categorize it as peaked. I mean, there's some very large programs out there that we're pursuing, and in fact are already active on, that as I said, will have some significant impact from a new award perspective on the back half of the year, assuming that the projects continue and assuming that there's no upset relative to permitting or some of the issues we saw on Conga. I think those guys in our mining group have done a really good job of diversifying orebody and geography where they work. And I see -- I'm encouraged to see that, that's probably a more sustainable business over the next few years than the typical mining cycles that we saw maybe a decade ago.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","But I guess I'm just trying to understand your comments when you sort of said something about a pause, and I'm just trying to understand the context of that pause.","David T. Seaton","I was specifically speaking about Conga, not the whole market.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","And just to follow up, in terms of your capital redeployment, the buyback in the quarter was not a lot. How are you guys thinking about the buyback in particular as the stock price is finally going up?","David T. Seaton","Mike, I'll ask you to answer that.","D. Michael Steuert","Yes, Andrew, it is partially stock-price-driven. It's also driven by our free cash flow generation. And as we continue to generate free cash flow, I think it's reasonable to expect we'll have a modest buyback program throughout this year.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","Okay. But if the stock price keeps going up, obviously, it sounds like it will be -- you will slow it down?","D. Michael Steuert","That's correct.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rob Norfleet with BB&T Capital Markets.","Robert F. Norfleet - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Just a couple of questions. One, going back to Power on the margin side. I mean, clearly, Q4 margins were adversely impacted by lower revenues and higher fixed cost absorption. How should we then look at the margin trajectory as we move into 2012? Clearly, the backlog has grown, but should we kind of view this as a low watermark for margins in Q4, and maybe towards the second half of the year in '12 be able to get back up to this double-digit levels?","David T. Seaton","I don't know if I would signal back up to double-digit levels in the near term. I think that we'll see improvement as we get towards the back end of the year and we get into the projects that we've just been awarded. But more importantly, we're confident that we're going to win a little bit more, and that market will change a little bit as, as I said, we get towards the last half of the year. I think the margin improvement is going to move more towards '13 than '12. Is it a low watermark? I wouldn't comment. But I'd caution that when you look at the Power numbers, the way we're reporting them, that will contain the NuScale expense. So you've got ongoing operations in Power but you also have NuScale report -- our piece of NuScale reporting through that segment.","Robert F. Norfleet - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And somebody here asked the question about the DOE funding program for the R&D, for SMRs. If you do receive funding from that, will that be an offset to your R&D spend now? Or how will that be in terms of reported as a line item?","David T. Seaton","It won't impact our funding for 2012.","Robert F. Norfleet - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And last question I have, David, what kind of opportunities do you see in government as it relates to Internet today? Clearly, the budget is up in 2012 in terms of rebids and new bids, I mean, Y-12 and Pantex, we know was out, in terms of being rebid, but what other opportunities do you see in the market?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think there's obviously that. There's the potential renewal or rebid of Savannah River in the near term. We're still growing at Portsmouth. So in the DOE world and the NNSA world, the mission's obviously changing, and I think that we're well positioned to be a participant in that. And the support, frankly, that will take place relative to the new technologies and how they're deployed, approved, deployed around the globe. I think I mentioned the DOD business. It's obviously solid, as I said, through this year, next year, and there's a fair amount of base operating support contracts that are being bid. And as you saw, Jacksonville is under protest. We feel good that the protest will go to our favor. So there's a fair amount of a shift into the base operating support mission around the DOE, and I think you'll see the military deploy in some different locations. And we're positioned to be a good supplier to the military. So I think it's a good solid business that will continue to have marginal growth as we go over the next few years.","Operator","Our next question comes from Avi Fisher with BMO Capital Markets.","Avram Fisher - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","On the Power side, your backlog is up to about 100% year-over-year. Could you talk a little bit about the revenue burn on that backlog? I presume revenue is not going to be up 100% next year.","David T. Seaton","No. These are the beginning stages of the projects. I mean, it will obviously ramp up as we go through 2012, but it won't be 100%.","Avram Fisher - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Yes. Are these 2 to 3-year programs typically?","David T. Seaton","These are probably nominally 24-to 30-month kind of programs.","Avram Fisher - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And I'm wondering. Generally, if you could expand on some of the things you've talked about already which is in the U.S., can you talk a little bit about the size of the opportunity and quantify it for the petro -- the U.S. petrochemical spend and the U.S. emission spend?","David T. Seaton","Well, I mean, the emission spend, I think, is going to be significant once the rules are known and the rules don't change. So it'd be hard to size that market until the regulations are known. But it's significant, and that's as far as I'd really like to go there.","Avram Fisher - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","And when does it start to get significant? Do we have to wait for the regulations to really be finalized?","David T. Seaton","Yes, I mean, you've got -- I mean, if you're a power company, you're trying to figure out what are the rules of the game. They're ready, willing and able to deal with. If you look at the coal plant situation relative to those emissions guides, they're ready to fix, close or sell. I mean, they know what they've got to do, but they're leery of committing that capital with the belief that things have changed so much over the last 2 to 3 years. Let's wait until it's solid then we'll pull the trigger. So I think in that case, there's going to be a lot of preparation work done and studies done, which as I said, we're participating in. But as far as pulling that trigger on what that's going to be, I think we're going to have to wait on regulations. On kind of the petrochemical side, I would lead you to comments that have been made by Dow, whereas 5 years ago, they've made the comment that they were going to basically cease manufacturing in the United States, to where now, they're looking at maybe 1 or 2 ethylene crackers, which, depending on the size of cracker and kind of what else goes with it, could be $1 billion program. And we're in that market and are active as we speak with some of the customers that are looking at significant spend in that petrochemical space in the United States.","Avram Fisher - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","One quick final question. Your guidance for G&A is down $10 million. It's not a huge number, but are you deferring any spending plans at all? Or is there any programs that you're deferring? Or it's just...","D. Michael Steuert","No, it's really just cost reduction efforts.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I guess first question just a clarification of an earlier question. My understanding was that the guidance did not include any share buyback. I don't know if that was clear before. Mike, has that changed the buyback content in the guidance that you've given?","D. Michael Steuert","No, it hasn't. We normally don't include any significant amount of share buyback in the guidance. And like I said, we'll probably look at that but not this year.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. And David for you, just, I guess, the LNG market has been a pretty active market, clearly a lot of capital being -- headed in that direction. I guess, I just want to hear your assessment of Fluor's position in that market. How would you rate yourself in terms of ability, capabilities and market share? And do you think on a go-forward basis, investors should expect more activity from you even though you clearly have had some activity there? Do you expect that to be kind of up, down or about the same as we look forward?","David T. Seaton","I think directionally, it's going to be up. I mean, we have -- I mean, there's other companies that have done much better in that market than we have, and we're taking actions to improve our position. We know we got the skill sets. It's a matter of making sure we got the right partnership structures with companies in order to have that value proposition accepted by our customers. But I do see us improving our position as we go through '12, and we're aggressively going after a couple of projects in that market.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's really your go-to-market strategy that's your key focus point here. It's not like you need to maybe partner with anybody else to go to market. You just feel like the way you it, your internal execution is really the focus point for you right now?","David T. Seaton","That's part of it but I'd like to think that partnering is something that helps us project ourselves better around the globe in certain places. I mean, when you think about the cryogenic side of that particular market, there are others that are better at it than us, and we're going to align with those folks to take advantage of that market.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Just taking a step back, I mean, you've answered a couple of questions on the margin. Power looks like you're being held back a little bit by the NuScale investment, as you had said before. I&I could be flattish. Oil & Gas, you showed some positive expansion there. But overall in 2012, when you roll things up, do you expect that you'll see margin expansion in '12?","David T. Seaton","I think that now you're also asking for guidance within the guidance. I think that we're going to see some improvement in our delivery, but I think the question's going to be is the significant amount of CFM that flows on things like mining and things like Kearl, that from a margin percentage standpoint will depress margin percentage, but in fact, real dollar improvement is what we're focused on, and I think we'll see some of that as we go through '12.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Yes. And just back on Greater Gabbard. So it's -- you're nearing completion, but I think there has been some noise made about, I guess, issues with the transition pieces. Just where do things stand as far as kind of the legal standpoint of, I guess, them saying that, I guess, Fluor is responsible for some of the costs associated with issues with the transition pieces?","David T. Seaton","We're extremely confident in our position relative to the technical aspects of the whole situation. I find it interesting in some of the findings that are coming up and the fact that when the experts go and look at these particular things, they come up with an opinion that's 180 degrees different than our customer's opinion. So it's going to -- we're going to finish the job. They're going to enjoy power from that -- those facilities. They're going to operate like they were designed, and they're going to produce the power that's expected, and they're going to operate over the life that is expected. So I think the unfortunate piece in this is that we're going to have to wait for a legal proceeding to determine the end facts. But from a technical perspective and from whether these things work as designed, we're very confident.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Just David, one more question relative to the margins. And I realize it depends on the project type and the mix, but if you look at on a same project basis as best you can, is pricing getting better?","David T. Seaton","I just -- I feel like the market is very competitive across the board, but we're doing quite well in that competition. I believe that the margin dollars that we're garnering fit within our norms, and I feel good about growing profitably over the next several years. The markets are there, our execution platform is as strong as it's ever been, we're focused on efficiency and cost, and I think we're going to be much more competitive as we go through the next few years without jeopardizing the margin dollar production. So I feel like we've kind of turned a corner in a couple of different ways that are going to improve our position as we go through '12 and '13.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And maybe just one other question, and maybe, I don't know, for Mike. And it's very early, but there's some tax proposals out today and some mention of increased rates on foreign-generated income. Have you thought about that? Any implications there?","David T. Seaton","I look at that like I look at the permitting process for Power. It's interesting the rhetoric you hear, but you hear a lot of talk and not a lot of action. So we're kind of going to run our business the way we run our business, and we'll deal with the outcome of laws that are passed and changes in that. I mean, the rhetoric with today was, yes, they're going to have a tax income overseas, but they're going to lower the corporate rate. Well, I'll wait and see that, too.","Operator","Our next question comes from Min Tang-Varner from Morningstar.","Min Tang-Varner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I'm just curious because this year, finally, your I&I business is actually overtaking your Oil & Gas business being the biggest segment contributing to your earnings. So I'm curious inside the I&I business, how much is actually mining contributing versus other infrastructure projects and whether the changing in composition between mining versus other projects is actually having some longer-term, I know you're annoyed about this, margin impact on the segment?","David T. Seaton","I'm not annoyed. I just had a great time with Jamie and the others talking about margin and guidance within the guidance. Within I&I, the only segment -- the only piece of that, that I think is maybe not clicking on all cylinders is the Manufacturing and Life Sciences piece, but that's primarily because for the lack of capital spend in places like the U.S., Ireland, Puerto Rico, Singapore in that particular market, which is a historic market for us. So when that market does return, I think that will also provide a good growth potential for us. mining is obviously probably -- it is the largest piece of I&I, but it doesn't overshadow our infrastructure business. There are several large projects that are ongoing, and we always talk about the Greater Gabbard project, but there's a very positive infrastructure project with the San Francisco Bay Bridge, the light rail in Denver. There's a lot of programs that are going very well in that market that provide great earnings streams for us. So mining is larger, but I wouldn't say demonstratively so. Relative to your comment about eclipsing Oil & Gas, you can imagine the healthy competition that takes place within our company because of that reality. And I see our Oil & Gas guys chomping at the bit to regain their position, which, I hope, both continue to grow dramatically as we go through the next few years.","Min Tang-Varner - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Yes. But which actually leads to my second question. I know that back in 2007 to 2009, your Oil & Gas business were on fire, and when oil prices declined and a lot of capital projects got shelved, you actually did \u2013 see the business declined in the segment. So I'm just curious when you commented that you're expecting the EPC contract will roll in within the next 12 to 18 months. Are we expecting in the 2013 to '14 time frame, you would actually regain that over $10 billion or $10 billion to $13 billion of the revenue line from the Oil & Gas business? Or are we thinking more of a steady growth going forward?","David T. Seaton","I think it's going to be a steady growth. I mean, if you'd look back to the time frame you're talking about, we were very successful in the refining segment as an example. There were 7 megaprojects in that particular market, and we won 6 of them. One ended up -- And only one of them ended up kind of being shelved after FEED, and that was the Kuwait refinery. So I think one of the issues -- one of the benefits of that period of time is you think about the earnings that we enjoyed during '08 and '09 and into '10, and we're not finished with some of those projects yet. It enabled us to kind of weather the economic storm much better than most companies in our segment or in general, which speaks to that diversity. Now we've seen a significant uptick in mining, which again, keeps that trajectory headed to the north from an overall corporation perspective. So I'm signaling that we're seeing improvements and a steady increase in our Oil & Gas business. But when they regain that revenue burn, I really wouldn't say, but it's going to be a steady growth as we go through this year and next year.","Operator","We'll take our last question from Robert Connors with Stifel Nicolaus.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Dropping the Oil & Gas prospect list, there's been some recent press reports that rather large upstream expansion projects that Fluor had been involved in on just the initial phases now starting to gather steam on their expansion phases, especially within places like central Asia. I was just wondering if you're seeing those same dynamics and if clients are coming back to the drawing boards on these expansions.","David T. Seaton","They absolutely are, and we're helping some of them with their scoping efforts right now.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then the Oil & Gas headcount also grew at a double-digit clip for the first time in about 3 years. I was just wondering if it was more front-end or back-end loaded through the year and if the costs for these hirings were material and also, how you see headcount progressing either at a faster or slower rate as you go through 2012 and '13.","David T. Seaton","There's no material cost impact relative to those employees, and it's across the board. I think we've really perfected that dispersed execution model to where you're seeing increases in Asia, central Asia, Australia, to support that dispersed execution, but providing some stability across the rest of the system, North America, Europe and otherwise. So I think you're going to see a continued increase in headcount in that market that follows these projects as they're awarded. But I'm really encouraged from 2 perspectives. One, the level of talent that we're able to attract and retain because of our tools systems and development processes; and I'm very comfortable about our ability to deploy these resources anywhere in the world. So I think we've got a pretty good model about how we deploy our people.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then just for housekeeping since this was the first quarter. The debt's been on the book as -- you guys gave a consolidated interest expense\/income, but can you give a breakdown on what the expense was and what the income on the cash was during the quarter?","D. Michael Steuert","We don't but you can -- expense is pretty straightforward at 3 3\/8% at $500 million. That's essentially our debt.","Operator",".","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Seaton, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David T. Seaton","Okay, thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for participating this afternoon. Jamie, I'm sure I'll hear from you later, and I already apologize for using your name in the margin question. But just to wrap up, despite one of the worst economic landscapes we've seen in decades, Fluor's continued to deliver very strong results during 2011. ","We nearly matched 2010's record new award levels. We grew backlog and delivered growth in both earnings and revenues. We strengthened our balance sheet, and re-returned cash to our shareholders. I believe that Fluor is well positioned for growth in 2012 and beyond as those market conditions continue to strengthen. Despite continued economic volatility, the capital spending trends of our key customers remain strong and in fact, growing in some cases. ","As you may have heard, Fluor celebrates its 100th anniversary this year. And I want to thank you and everyone involved for the vital part you play in our success. Not many companies can say that they're celebrating 100 years, and we're very proud of our heritage, but we're more focused on the next 100 years and continuing to grow our company and deliver earnings growth to our shareholders. ","Our strategy to diversify, as I said earlier in the comments, both geographically and by end market, began many years ago, and we're reaping the benefits of that now. Our international business is robust. As I said, it represents approximately 80% of our backlog, and that is a testament to our diversity. But as I also said, the U.S. is starting to see some positive signs, and that's complete upside for us as we go through 2012. ","We've built a century of achievement on the foundation of being an excellent provider to our customers. And as expert builders, we know how important a solid foundation is to allow us to continue to grow. And I believe that our company is extremely strong, and our future is extremely bright. ","We greatly appreciate your interest and support of our company, as well as the confidence that you have in Fluor. I hope everyone has a great rest of their day, and I look forward to speaking with each of you when the opportunity arises. Have a good day.","Operator",".","That concludes today's conference.

Please go ahead, Mr. Lockwood.","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thanks very much, operator. Welcome, everyone, to Fluor's second quarter 2012 conference call. With us today on the call are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after the market closed. We have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making our prepared remarks today.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2 of the presentation. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information, and there is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of those risk factors in the company's Form 10-K filed on February 22, 2012 and in our 10-Q, which was filed earlier today.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today. Today, we'll be reviewing our results for the second quarter and discussing the trends we see for the second half of the year.","Now I'd like to start by covering some of the highlights of our second quarter performance and ask that you maybe -- please turn to Slide 3.","Net earnings for the quarter were $161 million or $0.95 per diluted share. Our consolidated segment profit for the quarter was just over $287 million, which compares favorably with $280 million of segment profit in the second quarter 2011.","I'm pleased to report that results for the quarter included double-digit profit growth in all segments except for Power, which continues to experience a weak market demand and includes approximately $15 million in expense associated with NuScale.","Our consolidated revenues for the quarter were $7.1 billion, an increase of 18% over $6 billion reported a year ago. New awards were strong with $7.3 billion in new contract awards during the quarter. Segment awards included $5 billion in Oil & Gas and $1.1 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure and almost $800 million in Government. Our consolidated backlog rose to a record $43 billion.","Turning to Slide 4. At $5 billion, the Oil & Gas segment had a sizable new award -- awards for the quarter, which included additional scope and incremental releases for a major oil sands expansion in Canada. Our ending backlog for Oil & Gas is now at $19.5 billion, which represents 16% increase over last quarter and a 30% increase over a year ago. The Oil & Gas group is gaining some momentum. We're encouraged by the recent growth in new awards and backlog.","Looking forward, not only do we see a large number of prospects internationally, but our opportunity set in North America is substantial and should progress into EPC awards as we get into '13, which is what we've discussed, I think, for the last 2 quarters. We expect natural gas prices in the United States will remain well within the attractive investment levels, which will drive significant investment in petrochemical and gas-to-liquids projects, many of which we're already involved in. Considering our strategic relationships with Dow and BASF and a host of other key clients, we -- they are considering those major capital expenditures. We're very enthusiastic about this market.","Earlier this month, we announced that we have formed a joint venture with Sao Paolo-based Construcap to pursue engineering, procurement and construction management projects in Brazil. Construcap has been active in Brazil for nearly 70 years and is one of Brazil's largest construction companies serving the industrial, commercial and heavy civil markets. The joint venture will link Construcap's long-term presence in Brazil with Fluor's project execution leadership. This model, I must say, is very similar to the approach that we took in Mexico some 15 years ago, and you've seen our extremely satisfactory performance with that long-term joint venture that we call Grupo -- with Grupo ICA that we call ICA Fluor.","Moving to the Industrial & Infrastructure segment, which posted second quarter awards of $1.1 billion, including additional scope on an iron ore project in West Africa and an award for a new auto sheet facility for Ma'aden and Alcoa in Saudi Arabia. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $19.5 billion, which is about $2 billion lower than last year as a result of the significantly higher revenue burn in the mining and metals business line. With regard to infrastructure business line, demand for transportation project is increasing with the number of prospects in the bidding phases that we expect decisions on in the next 3 to 4 quarters. And we're pleased to report that the I-95 express lanes project reached financial close earlier this week, so we will be adding this project to our backlog in the third quarter.","With regard to Greater Gabbard, the project is substantially complete. We are now focused on the arbitration proceedings, which are ongoing. There has been no change in our position, which is discussed in more detail in our 10-Q. We hope for a swift decision from the arbitration panel.","Now turning to Slide 5, the Government segment's bookings for the quarter were $769 million, which compares to $1.1 billion last year when we received advanced funding on the LOGCAP IV contract. Our expectation is the task order revenue under LOGCAP IV will remain consistent throughout at least 2013. Ending backlog for the Government segment was $505 million.","Global Services. They booked $279 million in new awards, including renewals of existing operations and maintenance contracts. And we believe that when the U.S. economy picture strengthens, it will have a very positive effect on our O&M markets. Ending backlog for the Global Services segment was $1.9 million -- billion.","The Power segment had $118 million in new awards and an ending backlog of $1.7 billion. We're beginning to see the pickup in a number of opportunities for new gas-fired project -- power project generation in North America, which we see as very promising. While the market for new power generation continues to struggle, we again report that Dominion Virginia Power has selected Fluor to design and build a new 1,350-megawatt combined-cycle facility at the Brunswick County Power Station. We expect to book the initial phase of this project into backlog in the third quarter.","Consistent with our guidance for 2012 power, the Power segment result included the costs associated with our ongoing research and development activities as it relates to NuScale. NuScale submitted its application for FOA funding in May, and we expect to hear the outcome of the selection process within the next few months.","Overall, we continue to see substantial market opportunities globally and are particularly encouraged by the growing prospect list in the United States relating to the availability of low-cost shale gas.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance as well as our corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, David. Good morning, everyone. Good afternoon, everyone, excuse me. Detailed second quarter results for each operating segment can be found in the earnings release and in the 10-Q. To follow my comments, please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation.","As David mentioned, Fluor's consolidated backlog was $43 billion, which is up about $500 million over last quarter. The percentage of fixed-price contracts in our overall backlog was 12% at quarter end. This number could increase modestly as we begin to book more power and infrastructure work, which are predominantly fixed price.","Our backlog continues to be driven by international markets. At quarter end, only 18% of our backlog was for projects in the United States, but we do expect that our U.S. backlog will grow as we book more power and infrastructure work and once the expected petrochemical investment cycle commences.","Moving to corporate items on Slide 7, G&A expense for the quarter was $31 million, which is comparable to the same period last year. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 33%, which was at the higher end of our expectations due to an increase in state tax expense. For the full year, we continue to expect the rate to be in the low 30s.","Shifting to the balance sheet, the consolidated cash and marketable securities balance totaled $2.5 billion at quarter end, which is down about $100 million from last quarter. Cash provided by operating activities was $129 million during the quarter. This positive result was driven by earnings sources, partially offset by growth in project working capital, which, excluding advanced billings, grew in line with revenue. A decline in advanced billings balances drove a cash usage in the quarter.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $66 million, which compares with $102 million a year ago. Most of our CapEx is directed towards the equipment business line and our Global Services segment. Through 6 months, our CapEx is trending below last year.","During the quarter, we repurchased 2.2 million shares for $106 million and paid $27 million in quarterly dividends.","I would like to conclude my remarks by providing an update on our guidance for 2012, which is on Slide 8. Based on strong year-to-date performance, the company is raising the lower end of its 2012 EPS guidance to a range of $3.50 to $3.80 per diluted share from its previous guidance of $3.40 to $3.80 per share. Guidance for the year assumes that G&A expense will be in the range of $165 million to $175 million.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Andy Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, so looking at backlog going forward, I know you're going to tell me it's lumpy. But the confidence in the Oil & Gas backlog rising over time from here, obviously, you had a great quarter. And then maybe you can talk about the oil sands in particular. Obviously, you have one large project that's been going on for a while, but you also have a couple of FEEDs out there that maybe you can convert at some point in the next 6 to 12 months. So maybe you can talk about those.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we are seeing a significant FEED activity, which I mentioned in the previous quarter as well as maybe a quarter before. So we're very active on that, and we -- it gives us good sight into what I believe will be a very robust new award story for 2013 for Oil & Gas when the FEEDs kind of translate into EPCs. So I think we're kind of at the beginning of, like I said last time, of a pretty good cycle for Oil & Gas. With respect to the oil sands, we are continuing to work on several programs up there. And I think, just like this quarter, there are really big slugs of work that come in as backlog, and that's what I think is going to provide a fair amount of the lumpiness that you mentioned. But we continue to noodle on how we look at our new award intake and make sure that we're being very prudent and only taking it in when we have the real sanction from our customers.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. So the other side and looking at mining, obviously there's been a bit of noise here lately over projects moving to the right, some of the prospects that you have. Your burn rate was obviously very good in the quarter. So maybe you could talk about your burn rate going forward, if there's any potential impact to that. And then just the prospects in line, do you still see them out there? And how do you look at backlog in I&I moving forward?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it'll continue to grow. I do believe that we've had several projects kind of move to the right or have been slowed, Conga being one that's been slowed and, obviously, the comments that you heard from BHP, neither of which actions impact our outlook in this year. Obviously, it would impact next year if they didn't come back. But I still stand by what I've said around just the overall market and when the improvement in commodity pricing is expected. When you think about the late '13-early '14 time frame, and these programs have to be there in order to satisfy those demand equations or somebody else will get them working. In the case of the 2 that I mentioned, we're continuing to support Conga on a much more modest basis as we determine the future of that program, but that doesn't impact at all the burn, if you will, that we're anticipating for the rest of this year. And in the case of BHP's comments, we continue to support that program. And even though there's a cash flow concern, I think, by all mining companies, it really doesn't -- we've planned for it, if you will, in what we've done relative to our burn and as reflected in the improvement in our guidance.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Two questions. One, David, I thought the one interesting thing about the quarter is you're finally at that inflection point where you're seeing Oil & Gas and the I&I backlog, they're finally at similar levels, right? So I guess as we look out over the next sort of 6 to 12 months, do you think we're at that inflection point where the Oil & Gas awards are strong enough to start outpacing the I&I business? Because that obviously has implications for profitability and margins longer term, whereas the mix has been negative. And then I guess my second question relates to margins, I guess, both on Oil & Gas and I&I. I would assume with Oil & Gas, just the backlog that you have, we should be getting to a point where the utilization starts to improve. So what are the 2 or 3 things you think we need to see before we hit a 4% on the Oil & Gas margin side? And I guess with regards to Industrial & Infrastructure, we -- you mentioned plus or minus 4% a couple of quarters ago. We've been below 4% the past 2 quarters. Is 4% now out of the range for the I&I segment? And if you want to pawn off the margin question to Biggs, you can do that, too, because he doesn't get the free pass anymore.","David T. Seaton","Exactly. And I will ask Biggs to answer the margin question.","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, Jamie.","David T. Seaton","But I will address and I'll kind to talk about mining in this and the transportation piece of the infrastructure as well. I'm not sure I'd put the same time frame, Jamie, that you put on Oil & Gas, but I think we're at a point where, as we get into next year -- now you got to understand, we're taking in services on the FEED, which really aren't big from a revenue or backlog perspective, but they're very good from a profitability standpoint, on a margin percentage basis. And I'll stop on that relative to the margin question. The EPC values are what we're going to see tick up as we get into next year. And I think that you will see Oil & Gas outpace mining as we get into next year. There are some very large programs, but I think there's also some modest projects out there that we're already working on that are in $300 million to $400 million range as well, which I think are really good signals relative to the longer-term growth cycle of E&C beyond '13, into '14 and '15, frankly. And obviously, that's when a lot of the earnings will drop in. So I think that's a very good sign. I think on mining, even though things have kind of pushed to the right, as I said, there are some major programs out there that we're still working on that still make good economic sense for our customers, and it's a matter of timing for them. So I think where I've used the term lumpy to describe E&C in the past, I think I'm going to start using that to describe the mining piece. But the other piece of I&I that I think is growing, and we've made this comment before, if you go back almost 5 quarters, there's been very little bidding activity in the transportation space. In fact, we've got 2 bids, 1 bid that's already gone in and I think 3 more that go in by the end of the year that are quite sizable. So when you combine that with the Oil & Gas piece -- I mean, sorry, with the mining piece, I think I&I in that segment has continued growth, but modest because of the amount of burn that you're going to see from a revenue perspective in the out quarters. So it's going to be a put and a take with regard to I&I, but the real, I think, growth is going to be in our E&C sector. So Biggs, I'll let -- if you wouldn't mind addressing the margin question.","Biggs C. Porter","I mean, Sure, I'll approach on both -- the first question on both Oil & Gas and I&I. On -- the first thing I would say is that we're focused on profit dollars rather than margin rates. So I just want to stipulate that up front. The -- on Oil & Gas, the awards in second quarter do have a fair amount of customer-furnished material content. And as David said, the EPC will pick up over time, and that's going to carry a higher margin rate going forward. But over the next couple of quarters, then, margin rates on Oil & Gas will be a little lower than that 4% target that we talked about earlier for the longer term. But once again, we want margin expansion, and that's the most important thing irrespective of whether the near-term rate reflects that CFM. We're achieving that. Segment profit in Oil & Gas is up 22% year-over-year. So clearly, a success on that front. And the home office hours are going up, so that's a good sign for the longer term as well. On I&I, yes, Mike said plus or minus 4%, I think, the last call. First quarter or second quarter run rate is 3.6%, 3.7%. It's going to vary over time based upon the mix of mining content relative to infrastructure content and when the milestones are achieved on infrastructure, which enable the higher profit rate recognitions. Based upon what we see right now, it will probably stay under that 4% number for the rest of this year. But once again, as the infrastructure jobs come on and materially hit the milestones, then we expect those rates to improve over time.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Scott Levine with JPMorgan.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","So with regard to -- it sounds like on the Oil & Gas side in the U.S. in particular, it's the petrochem and gas liquids that are the engines driving growth. Can you provide a little bit more color and specifics on timing? And help us understand, particularly on the gas-to-liquids side, timing there relative to chemicals and relative size of the projects that you potentially see moving forward in that area.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think first, we're seeing some of the smaller programs that will go into EPC as we get through the rest of this year. And those are quite good programs for us. The gas-to-liquids programs are of such size as well as the ethylene cracker programs that we're working on are of a size to where there's going to be a fair amount of time spent on the FEED, and they're going to be of a size to where a little extra scrutiny from our customers' boards will be applied. And some of those are multibillion-dollar programs, and there are several of them, so we're really, really encouraged by the ability to get in on most of these programs so early, and we have a really good batting average of moving them from the FEED into the EPC scopes. But I think those programs going into backlog from an EPC basis are probably mid to late next year. But I think there's a significant amount of the small- and middle-sized that are going to help that growth story within our E&C group.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","And maybe as a follow-up on LNG, I don't think you heard -- you mentioned LNG. I was wondering your thoughts on that market not just in the U.S. but also globally. You're on the Santos, but update on prospects throughout the world and maybe particular thoughts on the U.S. and other new markets, maybe Africa as well.","David T. Seaton","Relative to LNG, on Santos, we're not actually on the LNG plant, we're on the coal-seam methane extraction piece in the transmission. But with respect to LNG, we've been very active over the last couple of quarters in preparing and actually qualifying to bid on several of the programs in the Asia Pacific region, and we feel like we're very well positioned to participate in several of those. So, I mean, that's kind of a change from our past, and I'm quite happy that we've kind of turned the corner relative to LNG and currently have some traction. And I think that the near-term opportunities in LNG are going to be in the Asia Pacific region with a little bit of study work done here in the States. And I feel confident the ones that are here in the States, we'll have a shot at being a participant there. So that is a little bit of a change, I think, from our past where we haven't been part of that liquefaction club. I think we've made moves, partnering moves, to where we're kind of changing the game there.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Mike Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","David, back to mining. The CEOs in the mining industry are concerned about certainly government regulation and issues politically in a lot of these countries that are operating the mines and also with the level of capital cost creep or increase that they're seeing and given the competition for talent like yourselves and vendors, et cetera. Do you agree with that? And is there things you as Fluor can do to help moderate that increase to allow some of these projects' rate of returns to allow for these programs to go ahead?","David T. Seaton","That's a great question, Michael. The -- on the first part, the -- governmental activism is nothing new, but I think given the size of some of these programs and the delay and the cash flow concerns of these companies, it's just been in the press more than what we've seen in past cycles. I can't point to a mining program we've been involved in, in the last 10 years where we haven't had some sort of governmental challenge relative to permitting or some sort of civil unrest in some of these places around the globe. So those 2 elements aren't anything new. I just think that because the projects have gotten so big, many of the customers are using that in their explanation of what they're doing from a capital perspective. So again, I'd say that this isn't anything that we didn't expect or anticipate, but I think it's a little more in the press right now and, obviously, on the thoughts -- in the thoughts of many people. I think the other aspect to your question is, I think we have started -- and one of the reasons why I think we've got such a position in -- with many of the mining companies in a pretty competitive landscape is because we're really being innovative in trying to drive different solutions to drive down cost. And every project we look at it being competitive. But at the end of the day, one of the things that we're seeing is our ability to partner with our customers to kind of drive out the wish lists that are inherent in every capital program that we get into, which drives a fair amount of the escalation in costs that we see. So I'm pretty pleased with where we stand with the dialogue with our mining companies and finding solutions to hold down capital costs and deal with the timing element of some of these programs such that we don't see the huge boom that we saw in our Oil & Gas segment a couple of years back where you saw the significant escalation in commodity pricing, the cost of engineered equipment as well as the cost of craft labor. So even though it's a little troublesome to see the delays, it's not -- it's certainly not something that we didn't anticipate.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Well, I know one client in Toronto is relying on you on that with a major project.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from George O'Leary with Tudor, Pickering.","George O'Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Given kind of recent events that we've seen in the E&C space, I think M&A is on everybody's mind. Just wanted to get a better picture for how you guys are thinking about M&A, what sectors or end markets interest you and maybe what geographies as well are interesting?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we've been very clear that our appetite for acquisition is niche in nature. And we've also been very clear that -- and the areas of fabrication and construction are important to us. In some places, it's a matter of us growing what we already have. And in other places, it's about seeking partners and developing our own capability in certain regions. I think our announcement in Brazil is an example of where we feel like partnering is the best way to gain that construction capability. When I think about the Gulf Coast, I mean, that's home for us, and we've got quite a capability with regard to direct-hire construction in that market. And that's obviously a place where we're going to grow that capability to service the customers' needs. But I think I restate kind of our approach relative to adding skill sets that are necessary for our offering to our customers, and we'll see what the market -- how the market treats other types of acquisitions.","George O'Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","And then one more question. Just can we get an update on SMR and NuScale and how that's all proceeding? And...","David T. Seaton","Yes, thanks for that question. We are -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we submitted our application for FOA about 4 weeks ago, and we're very happy about the reception we've gotten. We held a Industry Day last week in Oregon. It was very well attended not only by potential customers but also by potential partners. And we continue to have a dialogue with manufacturing-type partners that we hope will come in and be a partner in how we monetize this operation. As I've said, I believe that the small modular reactor is a huge piece of the future generating capacity. It fits into several markets that we already have a good foot in, both -- they're all from the standpoint of the U.S. Government's use of this type of technology. I think there's a bigger market outside of the United States, I think, which fits very nicely into our footprint. And we'll be able to deploy these units from an engineering, procurement and construction perspective. But then I think there's also a third segment of that market where there's energy-intensive industrial uses that will change their cost basis once this technology is proven out. I still am as bullish on the market, and I'm more encouraged about our future prospects from bringing in additional talents and skills to share in the R&D responsibility deploying this technology.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Good to see the award on Brunswick County. I guess I'm just wondering how you feel about the risk profile of that project. And then, more broadly, you mentioned about increasing fixed-price mix generally as the transportation and power picks up. So how are you thinking about how much risk to put into the backlog over the next couple of years?","David T. Seaton","That's a great question. I think with regard to Brunswick, we're not concerned about that risk profile at all. We'll take in a limited notice to proceed in the third quarter and then the major piece of that as we get into next year. And it's in our sweet spot. I mean, it's -- direct-hire construction in Virginia. We worked for Dominion and have had great success with them as a customer. And it fits very nicely within the model that their power group has. With regard to lump sum as a component, if you go back in our history, we've been as high as 40%, 45% fixed price. I'm not signaling that that's where we're going, but I think it speaks to the capacity of the organization to grow prudently and profitably above the percentage that -- where we stand today. Looking at the power market, I mean, obviously, those are going to be \"multiple hundred million dollar\" kinds of programs, as well as the infrastructure projects. And in those 2 cases, I'm very comfortable with those units' ability to deliver the expected profits on those programs. So I look at that percentage as a band, and our comfort in doing more lump sum is going to be specifically as it relates to the type of project, to the location of the project and the customers that we choose to do fixed-price projects with.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then are there any notable government programs that you're bidding on in the next few quarters that could replace the LOGCAP work when Afghanistan winds down? And then I guess just general thoughts around government strategy.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think there are several programs that we're bidding on in the services space: base services, base management, base operations and maintenance programs around the world. There's a couple of DOE bids that are ongoing with the normal partnering types of approach. We said in the prepared remarks that we don't see any marked change through '13. And in fact, if history repeats itself, when you think about the earnings trajectory, if you will, of Iraq, that will bode into '14 as well. But beyond that, I wouldn't really want to comment.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Two things. First of all, in terms of SG&A, the forecast you've given us -- implies a pretty substantial ramp in the second half of the year. And maybe you'd just touch on what's going on there.","Biggs C. Porter","Sure. I think we're just being a little conservative with respect to the historical trends, which do have some ramp-up in the fourth quarter. So beyond that, there's no real story to present in terms of what we expect.  That may ultimately prove to be conservative, but as I said, that's the normal trend.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And then just back to NuScale for a second. Once the government decision's made, I mean, should we assume that you're either going to continue -- that you'll stop funding it or half of it's going to provided by the government?","David T. Seaton","No, I think that it will provide a very large piece of the funding source, but so will potential partners that we will bring into that. I don't -- it won't drop to 0, but there -- and there would be -- once we're awarded FOA, there could be a ramp-up in the short term but then, obviously, drop as the funding is provided not only, as I said, by the FOA, but also by the partners relative to the manufacturing side of the equation.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And that's decision is still due this quarter? Or is it most likely now fourth quarter? I just saw that in -- reading the comments there, yes.","David T. Seaton","DOE and NRC basically said that they wanted to make a decision in September. We heard that they may want to accelerate that. But as far as from a planning perspective, we're still focused on sometime in September to hear on FOA.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And David, one last question, if I could. Your comments relative to the chemicals industry and GTL projects in this -- hopefully coming in second half of 2013, does that apply to the gas to liquids as well?","David T. Seaton","Absolutely.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Will Gabrielski with Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Did you comment on what FX was in the quarter? Impact to backlog, if you could?","Biggs C. Porter","In terms of the impact on backlog, there's very little impact on earnings, also very little. So not a big driver either way for us.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And did you make any adjustments to your existing Ma'aden work in the quarter, negative or positive?","David T. Seaton","No, but we added the automotive sheet plant. But the other work, there was no change.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. Maybe -- it's a big Oil & Gas number, I'm guessing, and it all came from -- or it sounds like you're just pinpointing the one project up in Canada. Can you give any more color geographically on what you booked in the quarter, upstream versus downstream, et cetera?","David T. Seaton","Now we're seeing some steady work start on refining. I think petrochemicals are still driving the growth in FEED work, which includes GTL in that particular market. Upstream is still the Middle East and Central Asia with a little bit of uptick in Australia.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And all of that equals $5 billion on top of your existing Canadian work in the quarter?","David T. Seaton","I think our -- it was $5 billion in the quarter.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Right. No, no, I was just wondering what else beyond the Canadian oil sands job contributed meaningfully to that number.","David T. Seaton","I mean, I think a significant piece is the -- is mostly the Canada project.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. So it's just that much bigger than maybe we were thinking about coming into the quarter?","David T. Seaton","Right.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. Sorry for the confusion there.","David T. Seaton","[Indiscernible].","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","And then in terms of the work you'll be doing hopefully in the U.S. on the chemical petchem cycle, how is that going to compare maybe margin-wise to rest of world? And will you -- I guess as a target, will you be self-performing more work there? And will that have a positive margin benefit?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think the answer to the latter question is absolutely. That's a keen focus of mine. I mean, I started my career in -- on the construction site, and I have a passion for that. And recapturing that preeminence is something that's important for me. And in fact, that's part of our margin growth story, because in some cases, those are pass-throughs from a revenue standpoint, and we don't enjoy the profitability, somebody else does. And our current strategy is to capture as much of that as prudent and dictated by the execution plan.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. But that's mostly U.S. where the direct-hire construction makes the most sense, right, not internationally? Or are you...","David T. Seaton","No, I think there's places around the globe where we're quite comfortable and have experience in direct-hire construction in the Oil & Gas space, and we're looking for those opportunities. I mean, there are some that we're already focused on, like the Santos project, where we're doing some direct hire. And obviously, building that capability in Australia, given the markets, will be beneficial over the longer term.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And last thing on Santos. If you can just give a quick update on how the project's going. Obviously, there was a lot of news during the quarter from the customer about the cost increases, and it definitely seems like they're accelerating some upstream work. I'm just wondering if you're exposed to that and if you're benefiting at all.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think there's -- we're -- well, I think we're executing per the plan, and we're very -- I tell you, Santos has been a very good customer from a -- just a working-relationship standpoint. They're very talented, they know what they want. And we work very well with customers that have a robust project management capability. And we expect to see upside to that because of the relationship we're building.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","First on the I&I segment. Just curious with the infrastructure. So you have one in the bag already, you got several that you're pursuing. Historically, these have been a higher margin than the mining business. I'm just curious, as far as kind of lead times in the ramp-up and the expectation of the projects you are bringing in house, when should we anticipate those are going to meaningfully contribute to the margin profile of the I&I segment? Is that a late 2013 type of dynamic, assuming you win your share of the projects you're pursuing?","David T. Seaton","Yes. That's a good -- you stated a good time frame.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay, fair enough. And in Brazil, so you have this new consortium. Could you just talk about some of the opportunities there? Is there anything in the near term we should be looking for? And maybe the types of projects that you'll be pursuing there?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it's primarily Oil & Gas and primarily Petrobras, obviously, that's the big target. We are starting on some smaller programs. We're not going to get out of our swim lanes, so to speak, and make sure that we do the right things. I think what you'll see in the near term is a fair amount of engineering and procurement services types of programs. And with Construcap, we will grow into an ability to do some of the larger projects from an EPC basis. But for the rest of this year and then early into next year, we're going to take a very measured approach so that we've got a sustainable relationship with Construcap.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","And just finally on NuScale. Just in light of the FOA funding, I assume you have a good chance of receiving that. You talked about bringing some partners on board, but does the funding itself change your view as far as the ownership structure? I know you wanted to, I guess, reduce to maybe become a minority owner, but I guess with the funding in place, does it change your view on that?","David T. Seaton","No. No, not at all. I think the thing that I think is going to help is once we're successful with FOA, that's -- it's not the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, but it's a move towards one, which I think makes NuScale, as an investment for others, much more attractive.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is really in regards to the scope expansions you've seen. A lot of your peers that have reported have also indicated scope expansions. Could you sort of provide a bit of color really on why we are seeing a general, broad-based scope expansion sort of phase? And just putting it in perspective because, we saw something similar in the previous up cycle, so would like to get a bit of color on why we are seeing this scope expansions in general right now and whether they're going to continue. Because if you really look at your quarter in terms of awards, it was very strong even with no large super-bookings.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it's not necessarily additional scope, it's the phasing of the project. So, I mean, this was kind of anticipated. There's puts and takes on the values of those, but this addition was not necessarily escalation, if that was your question. It was more of the sequencing of how the customer is sanctioning the project, which matches up with our conservative new award intake philosophy.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. So you could potentially, -- when you look out, other than the large development that are yet to happen, do you see other similar scope expansions as a possibility?","David T. Seaton","Oh, I think there's some, yes. And then I think there's, in some cases, phase 2s that we're already focused on that we would bring into backlog as we are sanctioned on those in the out years. And those are some pretty large programs as well.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then the second question is in regards to the Power side. When we go back to the early 2000s, when we had the IPP boom, flows down as much as $3.5 billion in annual bookings on the Power side, and I think, given the Oil & Gas cycle, a lot of people tend to forget that. So as we go into the potentially a fairly large build-out and switch-out from coal to natural gas, I would love to get a perspective of where you could see bookings trends going and whether we could replicate the past.","David T. Seaton","Oh, I think we can replicate the past. The challenge is going to be more on the regulatory realities than anything else. We're -- we've already done the front ends and are -- continue to do some of the front ends for several of the major generators relative to their coal fleet and what has to be done if in fact the regulations are solid. I think I've said in previous conversations that this -- I mean, certain regulators don't like the answers, so they put new permits in place, but they don't describe exactly how you get them. And I think that's where a lot of our customers are right now, is -- I was at an event with one of the Power CEOs, and his comment to the audience was, \"We're ready to spend $20 billion to deal with our coal fleet if we only had surety of regulation.\" So we're very well positioned with most of those customers and, in fact, are working with some on the early works around that coal equation and what happens. I think the replacement, in my mind, is primarily on the gas side. And as you mentioned, we're very well positioned and have the resume to be very successful there. I think one of the interesting things that's going on right now is when you think about -- I mean, it's 150 degrees today in Dallas, okay? A little bit of an exaggeration, but it feels like 150. But what we didn't have last winter was a cold enough winter to get those reserve margins to a point where there -- the public sees a need for change. I think with this summer and some of the challenges and conservation activities that are going on aren't going to be enough to keep rolling brownouts to take place as we get through the end of August. So I think public opinion is going to change when air conditioners aren't running, and I think we're close to seeing that. So I think there are some -- a couple of things converging that are going to cause a significant uptick in gas-fired power, and I think we will be very active in that space.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. That's always good to hear. Last question is really in regards to India. Clearly, you've been probably also following the news recently on the big blackout there. Is it too early to call -- think about the potential opportunities arising out of that for Fluor? Could it lead to perhaps more accelerated build-out of infrastructure on the Power side in particular?","David T. Seaton","It's a great question. I think with the Reliance work that we've taken in, we've added to what I think is already a robust capability in India. We've been -- we've had a significant presence there from an engineering perspective for almost 2 decades, and we're getting comfortable with the EPC market there. And I think there's opportunity for us in that power sector. But again, I think there's a lot more clarity required on exactly what the Indian producers will do before I get too excited about that being a significant piece of our business in the near term.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I couldn't help but notice that the margins in the Global Services business were a little bit higher this quarter. I was just wondering kind of what's driving that. Was there anything onetime? Or was that maybe an indication of just demand for engineering talent and equipment that maybe the demand has risen to the point where you're able to charge a little bit more?","Biggs C. Porter","Really, each of the businesses in Global Services performed well in the quarter, so there's no one individual driver. And there aren't a whole bunch of or any singular, unique events that stand out. There was a sale of equipment in one instance to a customer that had a gain associated with it, but that's still relatively immaterial. So nothing singular to point out. They're performing well, and obviously we're happy with that.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And you would expect -- is this margin level that we saw in the quarter...","Biggs C. Porter","I don't think I want to, business-by-business, give line-item guidance for margins for the rest of the year. We're happy, as I said, with how it performed in the quarter. We've given our full guidance for the year, which projects 2 more good quarters, and I think we probably just need to leave it at that. Nice try, though.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. And David, on the infrastructure and specific to the transportation side, it sounds like -- obviously, your tone, to me at least, sounds a little bit improved. Is this just something that's been incubating for a while with the way the projects have been queuing up for you? Or are we seeing real benefits from the fact that we now have a 2-year transportation bill? And if not, what's your outlook from here? And how supportive that bill will be for the next couple of years?","David T. Seaton","I think it's a -- it's kind of half and half. I think we've had a fair amount of just the gestation period of developing some of these programs going as well as the ongoing debate within the various states and the federal government about where the money is coming from. I think the infrastructure bill will be helpful, particularly around the TIPYA [ph] type of support that some of these programs require. But I think most of what we've seen is just a timing issue on bid slates. Obviously, there are some very large programs out there that we're going to participate in, and we're bidding right now, and I feel confident that we'll show some success as we get towards the end of this year and early next year.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just on Greater Gabbard. Just you kind of mentioned that you're hopeful for a swift resolution there. Is that an indication that you actually are seeing real progress? Or is that really just what you're kind of hoping for right now?","David T. Seaton","Well, we're in the middle of the arbitration right now, which, frankly speaking, is ahead of what I thought it would be. I mean, you're at the tail end of Wimbledon and you're in the -- and it's being held in London. You're the middle of the Olympics, and it's almost vacation season. I lost a bet with my counselor that we would actually get into the arbitration as early as we did. So I think we're very pleased with the speed of the proceedings, and we still feel very confident in our position.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Robert Connors with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","When you look at these large petrochemical crackers, are the billable man-hours within them comparable to what you did on some of your large North American refinery projects in the past?","David T. Seaton","No -- well, yes and no. I think we will probably have more detailed engineering content in those than we saw in -- what I would be -- say is comparable would be the petrochemical complexes in both China and the Middle East but approaching the kind of content that you see in a refinery project.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then your FEED-to-EPC conversion rate is pretty darn good when it comes to downstream. Do you expect that same sort of conversion rate on a couple of these large upstream FEEDs that you're working on? And is there any update on that $30 billion FEED number that you've given in the past?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think the $30 billion FEED number is still a good number, and we're active on a fair amount of those projects. I think that relative to our hit rate, we -- assuming that we're performing well for our customer, I think our hit rate's very well. And so far, we don't see any signs that we're not performing for our customer. I think that the value proposition that we have is largely supported by the talents of our teams, and we feel very good about our ability to staff multiple major programs around the globe, including the $30 billion worth of work in the Gulf Coast. I think the other point I'd make is in this period of time where mining has really grown, it's allowed us to significantly grow our bandwidth from a management talent perspective. So I feel very good about our ability to continue to grow and do multiple programs even more so than you saw in the refining sector in the last cycle.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then if I could squeeze one more just regarding some of the scope expansions. Do those tend to have a faster book-and-burn profile because a lot of your resources are already on site? And does that have any material impact on margin levels?","David T. Seaton","No, I would say not. I mean, as I mentioned in a previous question, we kind of knew they were coming and kind of planned for them. So, I mean, they're already planned in our revenue and profitability burn in the out quarters.","Operator","And that does conclude our question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back to you, Mr. Seaton, for any additional or closing remarks.","David T. Seaton","Thank you very much, operator. And again, I'd like to thank everybody for participating in our call today. As I think you've heard, we feel very good about where we are as a company with the performance we've had in the first half of 2012. I think we began the year with a fair amount of economic and market uncertainty, and I think we will all agree that broad sentiment in that fact has not improved much. But despite continuing macro headwinds, we're very positive about our progress in growing our company as it relates to our diversity as well as our global footprint and experience. As I've said in the past, I greatly appreciate your interest in our company, and we look forward to continued growth as we go through this year and next. So with that, I'll end the call and wish everyone a good day.","Operator","And again, that does conclude today's conference.

Today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. A replay of today's conference call will be available approximately 8:30 p.m. Eastern Time today, accessible on Fluor's website at investor.fluor.com. The web replay will be available for 30 days. Additionally, a telephone replay will also be available through 7:30 p.m. Eastern Time on February 28, 2019, at the following telephone number, 888-203-1112, using a passcode of 9818033. And at this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the conference over to Jason Landkamer, Director of Investor Relations.","Jason Landkamer","Thank you, and welcome to Fluor's Fourth Quarter 2018 Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Stanski, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Earnings announcement was released this afternoon after market closed. We have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making prepared remarks. Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our safe harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-K filed earlier today. During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts to the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now I'll turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David Seaton","Thanks, Jason. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I understand that most of you probably have a better view out your window than we have, so I hope you're enjoying South Florida. I'd like to start by discussing what we are seeing in the markets that we serve and what we expect to deliver to shareholders in 2019.","If you'll turn to Slide 3, we can discuss a few milestones from 2018. We ended 2018 with a robust $40 billion backlog with new awards more than doubling to just under $28 billion. Fluor was able to capture the upturn in the commodities market with a number of significant mining and Energy & Chemical awards, including chemical and refining work in the United States, iron ore expansion in Australia and copper projects in Latin America. Our most significant award of 2018 and one of the largest in Fluor's history was the $8.4 billion LNG Canada project we booked in the fourth quarter. This award represents our largest project to fully utilize the investments in data analytics and our comprehensive integrated solutions model. We expect revenues contributions from this project to be relatively modest in 2019 as we begin engineering. Revenue will start to accelerate next year as we start to release the module designs to our fabrication yards. I had a review of that project yesterday in Calgary. ","Turning to Slide 4, our infrastructure group continues to focus on and win projects that align with our core expertise of large rail, bridge and highway programs. This includes the Gordie Howe International Bridge, the LA People Mover and the Boston Green Line Rail Extension project. We also successfully opened the Tappan Zee bridge replacement project to traffic late last year. 2018 was a banner year for our Government group. We completed our power restoration work in Puerto Rico and also received contract extensions from the Department of Energy on the decontamination and decommissioning work at Portsmouth and our management and operating contract for the strategic petroleum reserve. And finally, our Diversified Services group had a solid year with Stork winning new technical support and operations and maintenance contracts for clients that include Shell, Ecopetrol and Chrysador.","Turn to Slide 5, please. I want to talk about 2019, and some of the key things we expect to see. As we discussed during our Investor Day a few months ago, we have seen a significant shift in contracting structure with clients seeking to execute EPC projects under a fixed price or hybrid pricing structure. Fluor has responded by developing a project governance and integrated solutions offering to appropriately manage Fluor's risk profile while meeting the capital efficiency demands of our clients and limiting project issues. Additionally, we're beginning to being increasingly selective in pursuing projects we can execute profitability with a high degree of certainty. Stated another way, our growth strategy is not predicated on pursuing new awards outside of that risk profile. We have reason to be optimistic about the year ahead and beyond. With the current strength of global economy, operators are moving forward with higher, long-term projects, which play directly into Fluor's strengths. We have a robust slate of prospects that we feel we are in a good position to win over the course of this and next year. ","In Energy & Chemicals, we are attracting some exciting opportunities. And in fact, 2019 is off to a great start in our first quarter booking of -- one was a new chemical plant complex in Louisiana. We anticipate additional petrochemical and derivative work projects as well as refining and LNG opportunities throughout the year. We're building off of the LNG Canada award and are tracking two more LNG prospects that could reach FID over the next 12 months. In mining, we have great visibility into what we're calling the double curve of this market cycle. The first curve started in 2016 with fee awards, converting to sizable mining awards in 2018. This drove our mining backlog to just over $7 billion at year-end. We are currently working on four copper project FEED and feasibility studies that will drive second wave EPC awards in 2020.","In Infrastructure, we're encouraged by the government's focus on infrastructure spending and are well positioned to bid and win work as it arises. And we expect to build off of our $6 billion infrastructure portfolio with several large prospects in 2019. These include the I-635 project here in Dallas, which we hope to win this year, as well as our recent selection as the preferred partner to design and build Phase I of the Red and Purple Line modernization program for the Chicago Transit Authority. In addition, these large projects or backlog will be further enhanced by smaller road and bridge projects being pursued by Fluor Heavy Civil, the Heavy Civil Initiative here in the State of Texas. For Government, we are well-positioned for multiyear DOE contracts, including participation in the DOE National Laboratory Complex and significant ongoing support of various Departmental of Defense needs.","We continue to work on LOGCAP IV contract and expect to share more about our pursuit on LOGCAP V contract later this year. We're also looking at the timing of opportunities with the Army Corps of Engineers and the DOE high-level liquid waste programs. Finally, I want to point to our government activities and receipt of payments were not impacted by the government shutdown.","Our Diversified Services group continues to do a solid job of serving their clients. Past few years have been a period of consolidation and cost competitiveness and redefining our role in the marketplace. In 2019, we are focusing on where and how we grow. We are expanding our footprint beyond Energy & Chemicals segment and focusing on higher-margin businesses. ","Before I hand the call over to Bruce to discuss the financial results and guidance for the year, I want to comment on our safety initiative. 2018 was again a strong year regarding our safety performance. Our employees work more than 300 million hours with an incident rate 2\/3 lower than the industry average. We also made great progress on access to further improve our safety culture, and this includes our new Safer Together initiative, which embraces our commitment to a caring and preventative workplace through worker and leadership engagement.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Bruce. Bruce?","Bruce Stanski","Thank you, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our full year 2018 results on Slide 6. Revenue for the year was $19.2 billion compared to $19.5 billion a year ago. With new awards just under $28 billion, our book-to-bill ratio is 1.4, is the highest we delivered since the early 1990s. Corporate G&A expense for 2018 was $148 million, down from $192 million a year ago. Expenses for the year were favorably impacted by foreign exchange gains and reduced compensation expenses. 2018 net earnings attributed to Fluor were $225 million or $1.59 per diluted share. This includes $79 million or $0.56 per diluted share for the establishment of a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets. Excluding this noncash item, adjusted earnings attributed to Fluor for 2018 were $304 million or $2.15 per diluted share. Consolidated segment profit for the year was $602 million.","Now I'd like to ask you to turn to Slide 7, if you would, for fourth quarter results. Revenue for the fourth quarter was $4.8 billion, with new awards of $10.1 billion, our book-to-bill ratio was above 2 for the second consecutive quarter. Earnings for the fourth quarter were $50 million or $0.36 per diluted share. Excluding the $58 million or $0.41 per diluted share and noncash tax charges related to the valuation allowance, which I just mentioned, adjusted earnings attributed to Fluor were $108 million or $0.77 per diluted share. It's important to point out that our earnings for the fourth quarter also include a benefit of $0.36 related to favorable foreign exchange fluctuations and reduced compensation expenses, and a $0.40 charge related to a gas-fired power project and a downstream project, both now online, and an offshore project.","Shifting to the balance sheet on Slide 8. Cash plus marketable securities for the quarter was $2 billion compared to $2.1 billion a year ago. Our available domestic cash balance improved over 40% in 2018, and represents about 27% of our total cash.","For the full year, we paid $119 million in dividends, and we also took advantage of market conditions and repurchased $50 million of stock in the fourth quarter. I'll conclude my remarks by commenting on our new guidance for 2019, which is on Slide 9. We are establishing a 2019 earnings guidance range of $2.50 to $3 per diluted share. This range assumes double-digit revenue growth over 2018, primarily driven by our mining work. G&A expenses of approximately $190 million to $210 million, NuScale expenses of $40 million, a tax rate of 25% to 30% and excludes any potential foreign exchange gains or losses. While we don't give quarterly guidance, we do expect earnings will sequentially improve each quarter and will be approximately 50% greater in the second half of 2019 than in the first half. This ramping up of earnings will continue throughout 2020. We do have good visibility on projects and backlog today that will deliver significant contributions in 2020 and beyond.","Moving to Slide 10, we anticipate average full year margins in the Energy & Chemicals group to be approximately 6%; Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure and Power to be approximately 2%; Government to be 3% to 4% and Diversified Services, which does include power services to be 4% to 5%. Our Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power group margins reflect a significant ramp up in mining revenue and client furnished material. Excluding the clients furnished materials, mining revenue margins would be comparable to that of our Energy & Chemicals group. ","For 2019, NuScale has moved into the Government group. The anticipated margins, I just mentioned, exclude the NuScale expenses. While we have a strong backlog in place, given the young nature of this backlog and how we now account for EPC projects, we won't see the immediate margin impact of the engineering work in newer, large awards like LNG Canada. However, we expect these projects will deliver higher-average margins throughout the entire duration of the project, which is what drives the sequential increase in our quarterly results. With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Moving first to Jamie Cook at Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","So I guess, my question is, David, if you could provide color on the charges on the offshore project in terms of, is that the FCFO, percent complete? How big? When it is expected to be done? And I guess, my second question is with regards to the guidance. I think you said back half of the year, earnings should be 50% greater than the first half. Just what your assumptions on that, is it predicated on winning additional work? Is it just ramp of existing projects? And what's embedded in the '19 numbers in terms of rev rec?","David Seaton","Well, the quick answer to your second question is, we're not really expecting any new awards to drive that. It's, I mean, just a normal flow that we expect. There's no big project in there that does it. I mean, as Bruce said, I mean, we feel really good about where the backlog is and how good visibility and probably the next three years, frankly, in terms of what that growth story is. I'll let Bruce answer that. But let me get to the first question. Project's about halfway done. It's not a significant issue. We are in negotiations with the customer and I'd really leave -- rather leave it to that at the moment.","Bruce Stanski","And Jamie, back to your question again relative to the profiling, and this is consistent with what we talked about at our Investor Day and how the revenue recognition standard is elongating the earning streams of program and flattening over the life of the program, generating much more earnings later on in its life cycle than early on, something we talked about before. Relative to rev rec, when we started with rev rec a year ago, we put $339 million in retained earnings. We burned off $103 million, that's in our K, you could see, in 2018. And we have $237 million more to go. The burn rate on that ramps down pretty significantly. So to burn off that $237 million, it's going to take over four years to do that, four plus years. So we are in a mode here as we predict earnings going forward is, rev rec is not considered in that for us because it's part of our normal recognition of revenue on projects now. So -- but that will give you an idea how to profile over that 4.5 years.","Operator","Moving next to Andy Kaplowitz at Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz","David, so you mentioned that you're tracking two large LNG projects. Are you a candidate for both LNG projects in Mozambique? And then you said that there were -- at the Analyst Day late last year, you said there were $40 billion of prospects for '19. You mentioned the petchem award in Q1. Have you seen any slippage in any of those prospects? And if you don't win a big LNG project in 2019, can you still grow backlog?","David Seaton","The quick answer to the last piece of that is, yes, we can grow backlog without an LNG plant in the count. It's going to be difficult, I think, to get FID in '19 on one of them. Marginally more positive in terms of FID in '19. But again, those things are going to push significant earnings, just like LNG Canada is, into 2020 and '21 and '22. We don't finish LNG Canada until that kind of time frame. So we feel good about the base workload that we got in our backlog. And I do believe it's going to grow. And I think the real next big growth spurt is going to be 2020 because it's going to have several mining projects in there, and it's going to have hopefully at least one of the LNG plants in there. We are not in -- considered on both of the Mozambique projects. But we feel good about the one we're in. I'm looking at a list of projects that -- and I'll just talk about E&C quickly. And they kind of -- we kind of look at it in different groupings of leads, prospects, things that are in preparation and then proposals that are pending. Just in prospects which -- or things that we have decided to chase, preparation and the pending column, there's about 45 projects that we're pursuing that are significant in terms of fee that leads to EPC awards in the out-years. But there's also a pretty healthy number of them that are EPC or EPFC to be awarded during 2019. In mining, I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're starting the FEED or the prefeasibility on 4 additional copper plants around the globe. ","So you guys know that business as well as anybody, and what that means in terms of new award values and the earnings schedule on those. You've heard me signal in the past, we think we can see the end of the tunnel and it's not -- the life is not the train. I truly believe when I look at the -- and it's not just oil and gas and mining. I mean, when you look at the infrastructure spend that's coming and the proposals and prospects that we're looking at, the Government group has done a tremendous job of adding to their portfolio and are continuing to expand their service offering. Stork is, we're starting to see the wins in terms of that integrated solution and why Stork means so much. I'm getting to where we're a little more enthusiastic about what the future has to hold. And with rev rec, I think it actually gives us better visibility into what those earning streams are going to be. And I feel really good about where we are. And I think, as -- '19 is a bit of a flat year only because of the first two quarters, but I'm telling you, 2020, 2021 and beyond, the machine starting to work, and I can tell you from the investments we've made in tools and systems, the governance changes we've made, I think we're locked and loaded. And I'm beginning to be very bullish about what's in front of us, in terms of being able to capture them but, more importantly, the changes we made that allows us to deliver the profitability at the end of the day.","Andrew Kaplowitz","David, that's very helpful. Let me ask me you about MII&P in the context of the margin. I just -- I kind of don't understand the 2% guidance in the sense that, we know it excludes NuScale, but if I think about history, mining projects, I thought, were sort of 3% to 4% margin. Infrastructure maybe high single-digits. I know you mentioned CFM. Is the passive just higher in this cycle because, I guess, the concern is that the infrastructure project margins are lower for something this cycle? Maybe you could sort of reconcile that for us?","David Seaton","I'll start, and then Bruce can give more color. I think part of it is the timing of the mix, because on the -- on a lot of those infrastructure projects that I mentioned in the prepared remarks, those are all just starting, right? So you're not going to get the kind of profitability in those early stages than you will as the project matures. Bruce?","Bruce Stanski","Yes, Andy. And if we take a look at just the fourth quarter here for MIIP, just the way that the project adjustment that we took, we're about 2.2% operating margin there. So kind of in line with our guidance going forward, but very much like in my prepared remarks, is that if we remove that CFM, all that material at the customer that goes through our books, the margins we get on our value-added services are very consistent with what we get in Energy & Chemicals. So it's just the nature of how we book and burn off that backlog with that customer furnished material.","Operator","We will go next to Tahira Afzal at KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal","So David, just wanted to get a sense. I know it's very early on LNG Canada, and you provided a great sort of framework of how we should watch and think about the project. But you said, you were just on site. Any updates that you came across would be helpful?","David Seaton","Well, I wasn't on site. I was actually in our office in Calgary. The team is progressing, the engineering. Early signs are positive in terms of long lead equipment that we're out in the market with. We believe given the labor market there, we are out ahead of that. We've got good relationships in the province with First Nations and otherwise. The way we're doing the project, there's sufficient labor there to do the pieces that will be done in Canada. Based on all the scrutiny, because of the size of this project and the involvement of everybody, including myself in that -- in those reviews, I think we're in a really good place to be very successful there and have a very happy client in delivering this particular LNG plant on time.","Tahira Afzal","Got it. Okay, David. And then, David, in line with what you've been saying, the first flash of updates from major oil and gas companies on CapEx outlooks and really the FIDs we've even seen over the last month, 1.5 months have been very positive. When do you think we get to a point where you can really start to push that pricing, the competitive dynamic stuff to notably improve for yourself?","David Seaton","You always ask for that question, Tahira, or at least one of you do. I think, I'll answer it the way I have always answered it. This business is a dogfight every single day. There's somebody that don't win one project that decides that the next project is absolutely critical and strategic, whatever words you'd like to use to describe it, and people are still in the mode right now of some pretty predatory behaviors. And we've been very lucky in part of this because of our challenges in being more disciplined and making sure that we're making decisions that fit Fluor's needs. What I can tell you is relative to margin, is we are continuing to work on our cost structure, our supply chain and our project delivery in terms of efficiency. And I look for improvements in margin to come from there. But you're not going to see that until we get towards the end of some of these projects just because of the nature of how they burn and the risk associated with them. So I know that our credibility has been shaken a little bit, but I know we've made improvements, and I feel pretty good about where we're headed in being able to deliver what I just said. So I think -- and as I said, I think you start looking at 2020, 2021, 2022 because of just how long and how large a lot of these projects are. I think we're going to see significant improvement in terms of margin and in terms of what that EPS outlook is going to be for those out-years.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Wittmann at Baird.","Andrew Wittmann","I guess, maybe these questions are for Bruce. I just wanted to make sure that everyone understood the quarter as well as we could, and part of that, I think, would be to decoupling the $72 million of total project charges. I was looking at this on a pretax basis and these have been numbers I calculated for the charges in the quarter, and wanted to see if you could verify these? On the refinery, it looks like the refinery took about $20 million charge, $40 million charge on the offshore project and a $12 million pretax charge on the power plant if you finish that one up. Are those correct?","Bruce Stanski","They're correct. The charges were $0.40 for the quarter.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay, yes. As we translate those to EPS, we should just use about, what, 25% tax rate or something like that to translate those to the $0.40?","Bruce Stanski","Yes. You can use an average tax rate because we're adjusting for tax later on our roll forward here. Our tax rate for -- on the quarter was in the tune of about 62%, but 50% to 60% because of these unusual tax charges.","Andrew Wittmann","Right. The valuation allowances, makes sense.","Bruce Stanski","25% is a good number to use.","Andrew Wittmann","Yes. Okay. And then just, I guess, maybe a similar question here to understand a little bit what was going on in the corporate segment. It looks like the FX was a pretty significant benefit to the quarter here, given that, I think, you'd already talked and probably baked in what your bonus pool was going to look like heading into this quarter? So can you just quantify what the FX tailwind was, maybe either on a pretax or an EPS basis specifically, not includes what's the compensation or the corporate cost?","Bruce Stanski","Actually for about $40 million, we're about $40 million under our run rate, about half of that pretty equally was with our foreign exchange and the other half was the reduced incentive comp payments that we're making.","Andrew Wittmann","Got it, okay. Very helpful. And then, I guess, I just -- looking at, you always have in your 10-K the burn rates that you expect and this year you have about 40% of your total backlog is expected to burn in '19. I guess, the question here is, and posted in the guidance there's obviously always some level of in-year, for-the-year book and burn. I guess, I wanted to understand how you guys are thinking about that amount that you need this year in a historical context just given that that's a component of your overall revenue growth that you're expecting this year.","Bruce Stanski","I guess, burn rates, you're looking at the 10-K for 2018. As we look forward, these larger programs that we have, particularly like LNG Canada, have a much longer tail on them. So the duration of the projects, instead of 4, 5 years are 8 years or longer. So the burn rate will slow down as we go into '18 because of the nature of these large, large awards. So we're not guiding right now on exactly what burn rate is going to be. But I think that will help a lot, which is kind of -- if you kind of increase the time duration by 2 or 3 years, that should help you.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Dudas at Vertical Research.","Michael Dudas","David, really following up on Tahira and Andy's questions relative to current year 2019 booking levels and expectations, it sounds like, you obviously are coming in with a record backlog. Do you feel comfortable that you can be more selective relative to what you're choosing and what -- maybe share a little bit about the difference in win rates you're seeing because of that selectivity and relative to what you're providing to the client relative to your integrated solutions and the changes you've made from that standpoint? And do we need to see a big backlog pickup this year? It sounds like 2020 could be the real big delta for Fluor's future earnings power going forward.","David Seaton","Yes. I think I'll answer the last part first. I think it's really 2020 and the first part of '21 when we see another significant jump. The '19 -- I mean, 2019, I'm not going to give you the number, but it's pretty robust in terms of our average year intake. I mean, clearly LNG Canada was a significant number. But even without that, we are -- we still started with -- the number still started with a two, and I wouldn't expect anything less as we go through '19. Now relative to selectivity, I think as I've talked in previous quarters and I can guarantee there's nobody more happy than I that 2018 is behind us. But there's learnings that come from the last two years. And I think those learnings have already been applied, as we booked work in '18 and even going back into '17 because I would remind you that the issues we had were booked 3 and 4 years ago. So we have become more selective. And in that process, given I think the integrated solutions approach, we've been able to go to some of these customers and help them shape the opportunity to derisk the opportunity for both sides of the equation there in some of the projects that we're winning.","So yes, we've become more selective. I wouldn't say that win rate has -- it hasn't dropped or increased during this period of time, but I think what we've been able to do is really get back into the mode of being that consultant -- or the consultative sale with a customer and coming up with a right answer as opposed to maybe what the three bids and a cloud of dust would suggest. But I also go back and say, I've never seen the market allow us to raise prices. I would rather come up with a better mousetrap, a more efficient execution, a more sure delivery in terms of cost and schedule, and take that money to my bottom line from sticking to my netting as opposed to really looking for the customer for more. I believe that when you look at the size of the projects that these customers are doing and it doesn't matter the industry, they're looking for somebody that can deliver the asset and that is becoming a pretty small subset of competitors. And I do believe we're one of that subset that can deliver these assets. Over time, we will be the go-to company, and that's where we're headed. And that's when I think we continue to improve our efficiency and competitiveness, and at the same time drop more money to the bottom line.","Michael Dudas","To take that one step further, as you're setting up for this pretty big ramp in activity and project opportunities and earnings power, the future of Fluor, how do you feel today relative to your asset utilization, your people, your tools? Is there appetite or requirements for acquisitions? And how you're thinking through that in the landscape where we've seen a lot of other companies shakeout in different levels?","David Seaton","I think one of -- and we showed you some of this in the Investor Day. I feel really good about the investments that we've made in terms of tools and systems, and the discipline and governance around how we bid projects, how we start projects, how we go to the various phases and what those requirements are going to be. So I feel really, really good about that. I also feel really good about the talent that's coming up. I've spent a lot of time over the last, I don't know, probably 12 months all over the world with our people. There is an excited young, capable group of folks that we're going to be relying on that they're really talented folks, but they've also got a mix of scars on their backs, which I think differentiates us from maybe the competition because we're actually putting these people in the field and they're seeing what they're designing. And those next designs are much more efficient and effective in terms of how we execute those projects. From a people standpoint, we look at attrition rates, we look at new hires, we look at college programs. And all of those indicators are in the green, so to speak. So I think our ability to attract the best talent in the industry and apply those talent, grow that next wave of talent, still is pretty robust. I feel really confident that we can continue to grow the organization organically from a resource standpoint, but notwithstanding that, there's going to be tangential things that we're doing in new markets where we may require a shot in the arm in terms of some of the specialty resources and we'll look at that when those things arise. But I think the depth and breadth of the organization, frankly, is as healthy as I've ever seen it.","Operator","We'll go next to Chad Dillard at Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard","So if you back out the LNG Canada award in the E&C, the resulting book-to-bill suggests like a pretty big slowdown around like a 0.2x book-to-bill, which is understandable just given the fears of slowing global growth at the end of the fourth quarter. I was just curious whether you've started to see customers come back to the market since then. And do you think you can get your book-to-bill above 1x in early '19 for that segment?","Bruce Stanski","Well, the second half of the year is going to be where we see the book-to-bill start increasing. Chad, I appreciate your question, especially taking out the Canada LNG. Canada LNG consumed a lot of resources and it was a target prospect for us. And so we could have used those resources to chase 5 or 6 or 8 other jobs, instead we're using to chase this job because it matched our integrated solutions strategy well and it was a significant award and we were very successful at it. So we don't back that out to say what's our book-to-bill because we spent the energy, resources to win that job. Same thing going forward into this year, into 2019. While there might not be any jobs quite that size, we do have a lot of large prospects on the books. And David talked about the mining prospects that will come -- we expect to come to fruition in 2020, but those efforts will be spent on those large jobs as well as the refining, the commodities jobs, the infrastructure jobs that we're chasing going on. So long answer to your simple question, but we'll see that book-to-bill in the second half of 2019 up to where you're asking, over 1.0.","Chad Dillard","That's helpful. And then just switching over to Diversified Services. I think, David, in your prepared remarks, you talked about planning to expand the footprint beyond just Energy and Chemicals. What sorts of new markets are you targeting? How big of an investment in personnel capabilities will be needed to actually get there?","David Seaton","Well, I think you've got to kind of start with the fact that when -- after we bought it is when the markets kind of dropped, and it gave us an opportunity to optimize what we already had in terms of the markets that we served. And it wasn't just oil and gas, but that's the one that probably hurt us the most in terms of growth. But when you look at the future, clearly the industrial piece of our business is key from owners like Procter & Gamble and Novo Nordisk, and those types of industries are certainly targets. Further into the fine chemicals market, if you look at where Stork and most of our oil and gas projects in that segment were, they were kind of refining to gas processing, the pipeline maintenance, offshore fabric kinds of things. But going further down into the petrochemical side is a key market. It's going to be regional, just like you would expect. I mean, the Gulf Coast is going to be a big place. Some places in South America are going to be a big place. Europe is still a big -- huge market for us. But then finally, we've only dabbled in years gone by in the mining business. Well, who better to stay there and maintain those facilities that we're building right now than us. So big focus on how do we leverage those relationships and those -- basically, the folks that we have in those countries, why wouldn't we take advantage of that? So that's just a little color on kind of how we're looking at Diversified Services, because it's not just Stork. ","If you look at the mining business, our AMECO business has always been very successful when the mining guys were spending capital. Same thing for petrochemicals or refining around the direct-hire components of those projects that we're doing. And clearly, TRS, our temporary staffing business, allows us to kind of flatten the peaks, if you will. And when those big markets are blown and gone, like I see them coming, you'll see that business respond as well. So it's almost like when the EPC side of the business is improving, it raises the water level for those guys too. So I feel pretty good about their growth prospects, again, as we get towards finishing these projects. So it is a longer-term play than the typical EPC burn on a project, I guess.","Operator","And we'll go next to Goldman Sachs and Jerry Revich.","Jerry Revich","David, you mentioned growing financials in hybrid type structures and greater risk on the E&C contract. Can you just expand on that? So what sort of projects that have historically been cost-plus? Are you seeing customers opting for that type of approach? And as you look at your prospect opportunity list, hopefully, you get an LNG project in 2020, which will likely also be fixed price. And so what's your level of appetite to undertake more fixed-price work, considering the backlog is now 47% fixed price?","David Seaton","Yes, I mean, we said that we're comfortable in that kind of range and maybe a little bit more. What we're seeing is some change in behaviors of some of the key customers around the globe where they believe the market is needy, and they're taking advantage of that and trying to pass the risk on to the contracting community. This goes back to the question that was asked earlier about discipline in bidding. And so far so good. But you've got some traditional international oil companies that are moving more towards a fixed-price basis on some of the front-end stuff, whether it's FEED or the like. So I'm hearing some feedback. Was that a question?","Jerry Revich","No, please go ahead.","David Seaton","I was just hearing some feedback. I apologize. But we're just trying to make sure that we're sticking to our knitting and what we can provide, regardless of what the approach is. I also mentioned that we've been successful because of the relationships and because, frankly, they're interested in the new approaches that we've perfected. We're able to kind of move some of the procurement to where it's more of a hybrid than say an LSTK, which I think fits into our need. So some projects are fixed in terms of the services, engineering and procurement services. Some of them are EP. And because it's in a questionable place around labor, we're kind of taking the attack that, that's not fixed price. In some cases, we're fixing the unit, but not the number of units. So I think we're really looking more towards the hybrid based on our ability to help the clients see what the best implementation strategy is as opposed to just, as I said earlier, three bids and a cloud of dust. So it's going to be a mixed bag. But as I said earlier, I'm really confident that the changes that we've made over the last few years in terms of governance and tools and systems is going to provide a more sure outcome for Fluor and limit, I can't say eliminate, but limit the issues that we've experienced over the last few years.","Jerry Revich","And in terms of the projects that you folks are actively monitoring at the executive office that are close to over budget or shown red flags, can you just talk about -- just help us build comfort with what that list looks like as we think about the 6% E&C margin estimate for 2019? Just help us build comfort around they not being additional charges? Maybe within that context, can you just remind us the size of the offshore project, just so we can get our arms around what's the -- how sizeable...","David Seaton","I'm going to answer it in a different way. We do about 1,000 to 1,200 projects a year. 89% of those are operating at as-sold margin or better. There's only 3% of those projects, and this is dollar-wise, are performing below profit. So I think the vast majority of our projects, I would argue, in easier term are greenlighted. There's maybe 5% or 6% in the yellow. And the rest are red. And we've already talked about the red ones.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And in terms of the size of the offshore project and the completion date -- start -- completion date, can you comment on that?","David Seaton","As I said, we're about halfway done, but I'm not going to get any further into the project than that, sorry.","Operator","We'll move next to Anna Kaminskaya at Bank of America.","Anna Kaminskaya","Maybe I can start with a bigger picture question. If I look at the commentary from you or other EPC companies, flow names and everybody sounds pretty upbeat about backlog growth for the next year. But then if you look at the outlook from just energy companies for 2019, they are much more conservative and we do not see much growth in their outlook. So I guess, from your perspective, what's the disconnect? Are companies just being conservative and guiding for 2019 outlook? Is it just specific initiatives of the market where you play? I mean, how do we get comfort that your positive upbeat outlook for 2019 connects with the outlook from the energy companies?","David Seaton","That's a great question. The first piece of that is part of our bullishness comes from the fact that we are more diverse than most in our industry. So we're not just relying on the energy companies to provide us with growth opportunities. That would be point number one. Point number two, I think that the energy companies are a little bit gun-shy in terms of announcing projects simply because of what's gone on in the last little while and the volatility that you see in the markets. In my conversations with those energy guys or at least on the oil and gas side, they haven't changed their outlook in terms of what oil price will be in the long term. So that really is not going to change their decision-making process, in terms of whether the project is a high-value project are not. I think how it fits into their portfolio and in what cadence or sequence that it goes in is really why you're seeing some of them being a little bit circumspect in terms of that outlook. But I point to the growth we've seen in our infrastructure business. I look at the growth that we've seen again in the manufacturing sector, which includes the customers that I mentioned on Diversified Services in terms of people like Procter & Gamble and Novo Nordisk and a lot of other -- of the \"industrial\" companies. So we just look a little bit different in the marketplace and the diversity provides maybe a little bit more of a positive on the way we look at things, because we're not beholding to one industry to drive the boat. Now I don't want you to think that oil and gas isn't important to us and mining is not important to us. It clearly is. But being able to say that we've got $6 billion to $8 billion worth of backlog in infrastructure is a big statement in terms of that overall Fluor look. And I'm very pleased with how the company has responded to that diversity piece of our strategy.","Anna Kaminskaya","That's helpful. And maybe next question is more for Bruce. How should we think about free cash flow for 2019? I kind of look at your previous cycles, your free cash flow conversion is somewhere between 125% to like close to 200% because you were getting some of the working capital coming in? Can we get to those levels for the next year? What can your balance sheet and free cash flow look like next year, with especially Canada LNG kicking in?","Bruce Stanski","And that's a good question, and I'm glad you asked because obviously we -- when we look at free cash flow, we generally look at net earnings minus dividends and then any kind of capital expenditures that we have, other expenses. As we look into 2019, we are starting up on a number of large projects and investing in joint ventures that are running those projects as well. So we will see cash. And if you look at our capital priorities, our first is supporting our business. We'll be using a fair amount of our free cash to start up those programs as we go forward in the first half of 2019. So as far as exactly what -- where we're going to be on cash, we'll see as the year progresses. But I expect to be a little less than the numbers you're quoting for the very reasons I stated. We need it for these projects for starting. And that's been our objective the whole time. Then once the projects start generating revenue and we're in the field with it, the cash spinoff of those will be very, very large.","Anna Kaminskaya","But should we think that at least 100% conversion and you can go north of that? Or just given how, I guess, disappointing 2018 was with some of the project charges, so just trying to get a baseline for the free cash flow next year.","Bruce Stanski","I think if you're talking about 1.0, I think that's reasonable, but maybe even a little less. Again, it's more important for us to use that cash to start up those large jobs that are really going to generate cash in 2020 and beyond.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. Mr. Seaton, I'll turn things back over to you for any additional remarks.","David Seaton","Thank you very much, and thank you for participating in the call today. 2019 is going to be an exciting year for us. And as our businesses grow and we, I think, at least message an optimism that we can capitalize on the investments that we've made in our business as well as the future profitability. We do believe we have the best people in the industry, and I think that's going to prove itself. I'm really, as I said in the Q&A, excited about the people we have leading these big programs and the future group of people coming up. And that gives me a lot of confidence as we start into this cycle and look at not only '19, but '20, '21, '22 and beyond. So we really appreciate your support of Fluor and look forward to seeing all of you soon.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, once again, that does conclude today's conference. And again, I'd like to thank everyone for joining us today."],"9181":["Fluor (NYSE:FLR) Q1 2012 Earnings Call May  3, 2012  5:30 PM ET","Executives","Kenneth H.

Please go ahead, Mr. Lockwood.","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thank you, operator. Welcome, everyone, to Fluor's First Quarter 2012 Earnings Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; Mike Steuert, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer; and Biggs Porter, who as you all know, will be assuming the Chief Financial Officer role upon Mike's retirement.","Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after the market closed, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information, and there is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of those risk factors in the company's Form 10-K, which was released on February 22, 2012, and in our 10-Q, which was filed earlier today.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are also posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon to everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today, we'd like to review our results for the first quarter and discuss the trends we're seeing for the remainder of this year. But before I get started, I want to acknowledge Mike Steuert's contribution during his 11 years with our company. His presence on our leadership team has been a calm influence during some of the most economic -- turbulent economic times in probably in the last 50 years. Mike's legacy will include leaving Fluor with a robust balance sheet, strong cash reserves and an impeccable credit rate. We appreciate all that Mike has done for us as Fluor's CFO, and we wish him all the best in his retirement. ","As Ken said, Biggs Porter is also with us today. Biggs was most recently the CFO of Tenet Healthcare, and during his career, has held senior management positions with Raytheon, TXU and Northrop Grumman, to name a few. I believe Biggs has a deep of understanding of the demands of leading a global finance organization in today's uncertain marketplace, and his diverse industry experience and leadership style will help the company continue to create shareholder value. Biggs, I wonder if you'd like to say a few words before we get too deep into the information.","Biggs Porter","Thanks, David. I'll be brief. I'm very happy to be here and excited about being with the company. It has such a great history and prospects. David, Mike and our controller, Gary Smalley, and the rest of the team did great work with me to get me up to full speed. And of course, I'm looking forward to meeting Fluor's analyst and shareholder community.","David T. Seaton","Thank you, Biggs. Now let's turn to our financial results, and I want to start by covering some of the highlights of our first quarter performance, and I ask you to please turn to Slide 3. Net earnings for the quarter were $155 million or $0.91 per diluted share, which compares with $140 million and $0.78 per diluted share a year ago. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was just over $253 million, which compares to $249 million in the first quarter of 2011. Consolidated revenues for the quarter were $6.3 billion, an increase of 24% over the $5.1 billion reported a year ago. ","Now I'm particularly pleased to report that the results for the quarter included double-digit growth in both revenue and profit for our Oil & Gas segments, Industrial & Infrastructure segment, as well as our Global Services segment. 2012 new awards got off to a very strong start with $8.4 billion in contracts awarded during the first quarter. Segment awards included $3.9 billion in Oil & Gas, $3.7 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure. Our consolidated backlog rose to a new company record of $42.5 billion, a 14% increase over a year ago. ","And now please turn to Slide #4. At $3.9 billion, the Oil & Gas segment had a very strong new awards production for the quarter, including the TCO award in Kazakhstan, an award for Reliance Industries in India, Pemex in Mexico and incremental scopes on oil sands and offshore projects in Canada. Ending backlog for Oil & Gas rose $1.7 billion over last quarter and 24% over a year ago to end the quarter at $16.8 billion. ","During the quarter, we announced an alliance agreement with Dow Chemical, provide EPC and construction management support for their global capital projects program. In addition, BASF, another key [ph] client, expanded their existing partnership agreement with Fluor to include not only Asia and Europe, but also North America. I believe these agreements validate our leadership in the petrochemical industry and demonstrate the kind of partnerships that we have with many of our customers as they continue to expand globally as well as domestically. ","We continue to work on numerous front-end programs in Oil & Gas. We feel very good about this continuing level of FEED activity as it represents a tremendous aggregate total installed cost and sizable EPC opportunities for Fluor. ","The Industrial & Infrastructure segment also posted strong first quarter new awards at $3.7 billion, including an iron ore project in Western Australia, a copper mine expansion in Peru and 2 copper projects in the United States. ","The Mining & Metals business line is working on a number of feasibility and FEED contracts, and commodity markets continues to support the substantial ongoing capital investments of our customers. 2012 is shaping up again to be another busy year. Backlog for Industrial & Infrastructure rose to $21.4 billion, which is an 8% increase over last year. ","With regard to infrastructure business line, I want to provide you with a quick update on our Greater Gabbard project. The project is essentially done, all 140 wind turbine generators installed and energized and all cabling laid. All cables are connected with the exception of one which is in process. With mainly punch list items remain, we should be substantially complete as we expected and communicated before as we end the second quarter. There have been a few media reports in the past regarding counterclaims by our customer; we believe their claims, which allege defects, are completely without merit. ","Turning to Slide 5. The Government segment bookings in the quarter were $389 million compared to $882 million a year ago, which booked the initial award of Portsmouth. We continue to see a consistent level of task order volume under the LOGCAP IV contract in Afghanistan at least through 2013, and we recently announced a new task order awards for the U.S. Army in Africa. ","We are pleased to report that the protest of our win for the Jacksonville Naval Air Station contract was favorably resolved during the quarter. We're now actively engaged in transitioning onto this site. Ending backlog for the Government segment was $695 million. ","Global Services segment booked $249 million in new awards, including renewals for existing operations and maintenance contracts. We expect when the U.S. economy picture strengthens, it will have a positive effect on our O&M markets. Ending backlog for the Global Services segment was $1.9 billion. ","Now the Power segment had $93 million in new awards and an ending backlog of $1.8 billion. We're beginning to see a visible pickup in the number of opportunities for gas-fired power generation, which is encouraging. We're also anxiously awaiting clarity on the proposed but stalled pollution control guidelines. Consistent with our guidance for 2012, our Power segment results include the costs associated with the ongoing research and development investments in NuScale. NuScale is actively engaged in preparing its application for a Department of Energy funding through the FOA process announced in January. ","Now when you look at our end markets overall, we really see opportunities across the portfolio including Oil & Gas, petrochemicals, mining, transportation, power and government. International capital programs continue to rule the day but a strengthening U.S. economy would certainly be a plus. ","Now I'd like to turn it over, the last time, to Mike Steuert, Fluor's CFO and ask him to provide some of the details of the operating performance and our corporate financial metrics. Mike?","D. Michael Steuert","Thanks, David, and David keeps telling me to quit smiling. I've been doing that all day long. Anyway, I know it may be hard to believe, but I will miss these calls, and I will miss the regular interface with the investor community. But I am confident that you'll be in good hands with Biggs going forward. ","Our detailed results for each operating segment can be found in the earnings release and in the 10-Q. Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. As David mentioned, Fluor's consolidated backlog was up $3 billion over the last quarter to a record $42.5 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 13% at quarter end, with 79% of the backlog for projects located outside of the United States. ","Moving on to corporate items on Slide 7. G&A expenses for the quarter was $38 million, up from $34 million a year ago. The increase was a net result of quite a number of factors, none of which was individually significant.  The tax rate for the quarter was 26%. We expect the tax rate for the full year to be in the 31% to 33% range. ","Moving on to the balance sheet. Consolidated cash from our securities ended the quarter with $2.7 billion, which is down about $100 million from year end. Cash utilized by operating activities was $47 million during the quarter, which was mainly due to the timing of payments in the U.S. Army for ongoing LOGCAP work. This quarter end, we have received approximately $200 million in LOGCAP payments. ","In addition, during the quarter, we repurchased $27 million of Fluor shares and paid $21 million in dividends. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $54 million, which compares with $56 million a year ago. ","In summary, Fluor's financial position remains extremely strong. ","Finally, let me conclude my remarks by talking about our guidance for 2012, which is shown on Slide 8. First quarter financial results including solid earnings, strong new awards and record backlog point to the company's growth expectations for 2012. At this early stage of the year, we are reaffirming our 2012 guidance in the range of $3.40 to $3.80 per share.  Our 2012 guidance assumes G&A expense will be in the range of $160 million to $180 million, and that capital expenditures are expected to be approximately $250 million to $280 million. ","Now with that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll go first to Andy Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mike, congratulations. David, maybe you can talk about going forward, prospects in Oil & Gas. I mean, I hate to be greedy after a very good quarter but can you still grow backlog from here? I mean, we always want more. So are the prospects pretty evenly distributed globally? How should we think about Oil & Gas backlog going forward?","David T. Seaton","Well one thing, we're absolutely aligned on growing backlog. I think as we've said in the past, it's going to be lumpy. But we really had a really good quarter this quarter, and I do believe as we end the year, we have the opportunity to continue to grow backlog. The prospects are across-the-board and it's not just Oil & Gas. There\u2019s still a lot of headroom in a lot of different markets. But specifically to your question about Oil & Gas, I think it's pretty diverse, frankly. It's geographically diverse. And it's both in upstream as well as downstream but I do believe you're going to start to see a significant amount of petrochemicals come back in through that backlog. As we said, we've got 2 really good relationships with 2 of the premier people in that petrochemical market. So we feel like we're in a pretty good position for the uptick that I think is going to take place over the next 5 years in the United States. But I think the story is, is our global footprint and our ability to satisfy a pretty wide-ranging list of Oil & Gas customers just about any place on the planet.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","That's helpful. And then obviously, we're getting lots of investor questions on mining CapEx and how that might have affect Fluor going forward. I mean, you've, I'm sure, read or heard from -- about from Rio and BHP in their comments lately about mining CapEx. You -- how does that factor into your thinking going forward, about what you see out there? I mean, obviously, we know there's a lot out there. But what do you think the chances are that some of these big prospects that you're doing FEEDs on sort of get pushed to the right a bit?","David T. Seaton","I think I still look at the commodity markets and the growth projections that are out there pretty much globally into the '14, '15 timeframe. And in order for our customers to hit those marks, they have to be spending today. Of the projects that we have in our sights, we really don't see any of them significantly moving to the right. We feel pretty good about -- we feel very good about the backlog that we have and the prospects that will be awarded as we go through the next, say, 3 to 4 quarters. So although I've heard the same things you've heard, the actions of our customers on the ones that we're focused on, the projects that we're focused on, we see relatively little volatility in those programs.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Mike, I think it would only be appropriate for your last call if I ask you about I&I margins at 3.7%. We've been spoiled by 4%-plus. Anything in the quarter here? I know you're over-absorbing in mining, so mining margins should be pretty good so what do you think?","D. Michael Steuert","Well, they're going to stay healthy, Andy. I mean, they have bounced around. They will bounce around a little bit, plus or minus 4% as we go through 2012. I think we had solid margins this quarter, and I expect to see healthy margins through the rest of this year. I mean as David said though, the market remains very robust.","Operator","We'll go next to Jamie Cook from Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Anyway, just 2 questions. One, again, the awards were very healthy on the mining side even with some of the more cautious comments out there. I thought the awards in mining would sort to be back-end loaded. So can you talk about was there any pull-forward in awards relative to what you thought or were you just being conservative before? On the Oil & Gas side, the profit dollars over the past couple of quarters have been consistent, but the margins have showed 3 quarters of modest improvement. So how do we think about that in the back half of the year? And then my last question, Mike, I am surprised we didn't see more of a share repurchase in the program just given how your stock has been trading recently, the concerns on mining and just the prospects you have out there. So if you can just address that.","David T. Seaton","Mike, why don't you handle the last one, and I'll take the mining and Oil & Gas questions.","D. Michael Steuert","Okay. Well, Jamie, one of the things we've said over the past years is we've kind of gated our share repurchases to our free cash flow generation. And as we said, we used about $100 million of free cash flow in the quarter, about $50 million from operations and some for share repurchase and dividends. And that was just a reflection of the fact that we are building working capital as the company grows throughout the year. If the stock --clearly, as the stock price stays where it is, which I think is tremendously undervalued given our prospects, I think the company is to going to very seriously look at share repurchases as they move through 2012 going forward.","David T. Seaton","I'll talk about mining first. Jamie, we never really communicated where we were going to be in the first quarter, and we did signal that it was back-end loaded, and I still agree with that sentiment. We're pretty much on target, and I'll use that lumpiness word again as we talk about mining and as we talk about Oil & Gas because I think this year, it is going to be probably more lumpy than it's been in past years. I do believe, as I've said that in both mining and in Oil & Gas, it is back-end loaded. So even with the good quarter we had, we think we've got some bigger quarters to come, assuming that things stay on cycle. Within Oil & Gas, we're right on target. I think as we talked about during the end of last -- well middle of last year, end of last year that we thought we were at an inflection point in earnings and Oil & Gas, and I look to see that to continue to improve as we go through this year.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So margins will improve in the back half of the year?","David T. Seaton","I'm not going to answer that question. You had your shot at Mike on margins. And I'm not going to give you another shot at it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","David, how is your utilization rates at your offices? How do you feel about the amount of professionals that you have on staff, given the growth in backlog and your pretty good expectations for continued growth into the future? And do you start to see some of the excess capacity in the marketplace start to get put away and maybe we'll see a little bit more quicker joint ventures or alliance agreements like you've kind of talk about with Dow and BASF as you move forward 2012?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'll answer that backwards. I think the agreements that were -- that I mentioned aren't because of a tightening in the marketplace. I think it's a testament to the performance on projects that we've executed for those 2 companies over the last several years. I think we've got a very good understanding of how to get the best bang for the buck, and I think that these agreements were a testament to that. So I think that our performance on many programs around the globe for these folks are really starting to pay dividends in how we interact with our customers. The first part, I guess, of your question was -- I forgot.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Regarding your employees, your...","David T. Seaton","Sorry. We feel very good about that. I think we've proven that we're the employer of choice in our marketplace, and with the tools and systems that we have and the on-boarding process and the educational opportunities, we'll continue to be that. We are not seeing any pinch points, as we speak right now, relative to the professional employees we need, regardless of the region. I think as we've talked before, the only place that I really see some difficulty in the future is in the craft employee range, where we need to really turn up the heat on the training and identification training of resources on the craft side in several places around the world, specifically Australia and I think specifically in the United States as we start to get towards the EPC of many of these petrochemical programs. We feel really good about where we sit relative to our ability to attract and retain the level of professional resource that we need to do; a growing backlog of projects as we go through the next 2 years.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","So in terms of question, if I look at your EPS guidance and if I look what you guys did in this quarter in terms of EPS, sort of implies that you're relatively flat EPS throughout the year, particularly the low end of the guidance was all the puts and takes. Yet your backlog growth in the quarter was very good, and you are implying that the backlog growth throughout the year could actually get better. So what exactly are you guys saying about the burn rate of the backlog or are you just being conservative?","D. Michael Steuert","Well, Andrew, as you look at our revenue over the last 4 quarters, the burn rate has gone up, and I think that will continue to go up as we move through 2012 with our healthy backlog. There are obviously some things happening in the year. Power is not going to be as strong as it was last year, but we do see some continuous, obviously, some improving strength in Oil & Gas and Industrial & Infrastructure, especially and Global Services continues to grow very nicely. So on balance, our guidance reflected all that and also reflected our planned investments in NuScale throughout the year. And taking that all together, I do think we're going to see overall strength as we go through the year. And we gave a range of guidance, I know you guys are at the top -- consensus is still in the top of the range and we'll just see how the year turns out. But right now, I think everything looks very positive for us. I mean, I'm not going to really narrow the range or do anything else right now, but I just think that we had a really solid first quarter and we look forward for that to continue.","Andrew Obin - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division","We'll always try. Let me ask you a question in terms of the payments from the government. Are you guys seeing generally a trend, in particular, there's $200 million delay? Are you seeing a trend that the government is extending base payable to the contractors?","D. Michael Steuert","No. What's was happening is the government is being pretty finicky in what's required to get payment, and we're just taking our time and making sure all our invoices are correct and every i is dotted and every t is crossed and it takes us time to get invoices submitted. Once invoices are submitted, they're paying rather quickly. It's not that they're extending our payment terms. It's all the work that has to go into and getting ready to be paid.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is in regards to Dow Chemicals. We've had several of your sales also highlight a very strong relationship with Dow. So could you talk a bit about what sets Fluor apart from some of your peers when it comes to Dow Chemicals? And as you see your opportunities in North America, what really singles you out?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it's -- it goes back to the history of what we've done. I think when you think about the ethylene chain, we're not part of that ethylene club for a reason. It gives us the ability to kind of take an objective view of technologies and how they are deployed, which I think it has proven over time to be a very successful area. I think we're extremely strong on the front-end FEED type of work and deliver a completed FEED package that I think is second to none in that industry. And what that translates into is surety of completion both in terms of cost and schedule. I think the global nature of our reach is also part of our customers look at wanting to be in more of a closer relationship with us so that regardless of where they have a capital asset opportunity, they've got an ability to come to us to help deploy that. When you look at what we've done for Dow over the years in Kuwait, in Argentina, in the United States, it's a long-term relationship where you tend to have people that understand exactly how to start a program, and you don't start from square one when you're pulling these teams together and these scopes together. I just think it's a -- like I said, it's a testament to our history, but clearly, customers value our diversity of geography, our strength in technology deployment, our I think, unending supply of talent and our ability to deploy that talent anywhere in the globe.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","That was very helpful. My second question, and I had to throw one in, of course, on NuScale. I was at a recent conference on SMRs in South Carolina, and the NRC representative highlighted your design as being one of the 2 key designs they're focusing on. And the sense I got was that their licensing process to date is very much on track. I just wanted to get an update to the extent you can give that and really maybe provide some color on whether if things are on track if that is helping you, or let's say, to elicit [ph] more partners?","David T. Seaton","I think so. I think we're absolutely on track or NuScale is on track to submit their application for FOA this month. We are expecting an accelerated review and award of the FOA, which could be as early as September, which is in line with what our anticipated schedule was going to be. And I think once FOA is awarded to NuScale, there will be lots of investors clamoring. We've had lots of discussion with many, many potential investors, but I think they're being prudent, waiting to see who actually does get the FOA. But I feel very confident that once that takes place, we'll -- they'll be off to the races.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","So you had a nice project win in Canada with oil sands. I'm just curious, it seems like a lot of projects could start getting up off the ground maybe in phased deployments. I was just curious how you see that progressing through 2012 and '13 and kind of had to move the needle within the Oil & Gas section as well.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it's going to be consistent as we go through the year, and yes, it will move the needle. I think it bodes better as we get into '13 and beyond because I think as you said, the oil price, still above $100 in some of these projects getting to a point where it's time to pull the trigger is certainly going to add that opportunity for us. And I think just like I mentioned in petrochemicals, I think we're extremely well positioned in Canada to perform a lot of that activity. I think our experience there, again, is seen very positively by our customers and being able to go from FEEDs to EPCs is a logical move. And we feel pretty confident about where we stand. And that market continues to be a major contributor to Oil & Gas' earnings as we go through the next 2 or 3 years.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners Inc.","Okay, great. And separately, can you just give us an update on Conga? It sounds like that's kind of a wait-and-see mode. Is that having a material impact on the outlook on '12? Maybe just give us a feel for what's going on there.","David T. Seaton","No, no material impact on '12. They're still going through their process and revalidating those permits, and we'll just continue to support the customer as we go through the -- probably through the summer in dealing with that. But no indications that, that's going to change, necessarily. Those projects are challenged, they're large, the government involvement tends to delay things, and this isn't really any different than a lot of other mining projects that we do around the globe. This one just happened in the middle as opposed to in the beginning and delayed it, so even a negative outcome on Conga does not materially impact Fluor in '12.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Will Gabrielski with Lazard.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Can you give us a little more detail on the Oil & Gas projects that you announced by name? Are you booking full scope on TCO at this point? I mean, is this stage really set? Can you just walk through them maybe and give us a little more color?","David T. Seaton","I think TCO is just the first increment. There'll be increments as we go through the next few years. It's a very, very large project. And like I said, this is just the first tranche. On Reliance, we have the responsibility for the EPCM services, as well as some of the procurement on both the gasifier and on the petrochemical facility. And in that particular case, we don't see any additional awards on that scope. There are other projects that we're pursuing with Reliance, and that's a good -- we're also a good start with that relationship, and I feel very, very good about that. On the oil sands, there's going to be several increments as we go through '12 and '13 on several of those programs, including Syncrude and some of the other programs. So I think we've got good visibility into the next 4 to 6 quarters and there'll be significant amounts of those programs that follow.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Is that the same for the Pemex, was that the Hidalgo Refinery or...","David T. Seaton","That was the FEED. So yes, I apologize. There is EPC values as we get into next year.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then in mining, you noted that you wanted something in Australia in the iron ore side. Any color on the customer? Was that your normal customer? Was that outside of your normal work?","David T. Seaton","No color.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","No color?","David T. Seaton","Sorry.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","That's fine. And was there any adjustment from...","David T. Seaton","No color, but you're pretty perceptive.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Was there any adjustment made for Ma'aden in the quarter?","David T. Seaton","No.","D. Michael Steuert","No.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Or is there any planned adjustment, based on some of what the trade press was talking about in terms of scope change?","David T. Seaton","Modestly, so potentially, I think that what we're seeing is performance issues on the part of some of the contractors that have been selected. And if in fact, they can't rectify their performance, there may be scope coming back to Fluor.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then on the mix of work you're booking in Oil & Gas right now, a fair amount of PMC and FEED work and the dollars are certainly big. I guess, can you start feeling more comfortable that margins can -- not just trough and sort of sit here, but you get more comfortable that the second half maybe just fixed cost absorption or something starts driving a better than high 3s margin?","David T. Seaton","I wouldn't venture to give a number there. I would say that we are seeing utilization pick up, and obviously, there's a leveraging component to that. As I said a minute ago, I think as you go back over the last 6 quarters, we kind of saw the trough, and my expectation is that you're going to see improving margins as we go through this year and into next.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then last question if you'll allow me on the buyback. Can you talk about matching cash flow to your repurchases, but you did do a pretty big bond deal last year, and I thought that was dedicated or targeted towards repurchases because you didn't want to repatriate cash to execute your repurchase program. So I'm just wondering what's holding you back on that.","D. Michael Steuert","Well, we did do a big bond deal, but we also did larger purchases last year that pretty much matched $600 million repurchase with a $500 million bond deal. I don't think you're going to see us do another bond deal this year. But like I said, if stock stays undervalued, I wouldn't be surprised to see us increase our purchases.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then maybe Mike, on your way out, you could tell me what the fair value is so I can adjust my target.","D. Michael Steuert","I'd certainly like to see it above all your targets.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Scott Levine with JPMorgan.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","Mike, congratulations and we look forward to working with you. And I was hoping you might be able to provide some color regarding the margin trends you're seeing on the [indiscernible] margins on new work you're booking here in the quarter and maybe compare that to what's in your backlog and their respective segments and what you were booking a year ago. Are you seeing any meaningful change in the yield profit characteristics or mix of terms, cost plus versus fixed price, what have you?","David T. Seaton","You guys are all the same, and you're looking for guidance within guidance, and you're looking for us to mark a number. And we're not going to take the bait. I think the message that I think I\u2019d deliver is we are seeing improvement in some of the markets. The predatory pricing that we saw 6 quarters ago has ceased and cooler heads are prevailing and the cooler heads and our clients that are prevailing is based on the fact that they're disappointed in the performance of some of those predatory pricing results. So I think we stayed true to our metrics, we stayed true to our risk reward expectations, and I believe that improving margins is something that we'll see as we go through the end of this year and next year.","Scott J. Levine - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division","That's encouraging to hear. My follow-up question, so we saw that one of the other Australian LNG projects experienced an increase in CapEx projection, I think earlier today, maybe yesterday. And I was wondering if you can comment on your thoughts on exposure. I think you've indicated that you converted the Gladstone contract cost plus, but maybe some additional color or thoughts on the labor situation in Australia and how comfortable you are in executing against that?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we've been pretty close to the estimates as we converted so we feel pretty good about our ability to perform on that upstream side. I really can't comment on the LNG projects that are experiencing increases. But I will say that the construction market is tight in Australia and it will do nothing but get tighter. So some sort of an inflation calculation in these projects I think is prudent. The outcome is yet obviously to be seen, but we feel good about the projects that we're doing and the estimates that we're working too right now.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Fisher, UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the topic of the major infrastructure projects like the Tappan Zee Bridge where you're shortlisted, did any one of those shortlisted teams get a competitive advantage or is it really going to be about price? And then can you talk about what kind of timing expectations you have for some of those projects?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think the timing is -- who knows on -- just using Tappan Zee as an example. They really haven't centered on how they're going to actually pay for it. So until there's a funding source, there probably won't be an award. I think we feel very good about our competitive position because of our experience with our partner, American Bridge, on the San Francisco Bay Bridge. And I think when you look at the execution of the Bay Bridge, it's going extremely well. So I think we've got a good opportunity to repeat that with a trusted partner. As we feel like we can be competitive both in terms of our execution approach as well as the cost. But there's a lot of infrastructure programs that are due to be bid as we go through this year, there's 3 here in Texas, and Texas is about the only place that has the funding source identified for these programs. There's a couple outside of the United States that we're pursuing, as well as some of the other ones in the Midwest and Northeast.","D. Michael Steuert","And Washington, D.C.","David T. Seaton","And as well as the Capital Beltway program in D.C. But obviously, Tappan Zee Bridge is a marquee project. We like doing those. It's a very large program, and there's very few companies and\/or consortiums that can actually do that work and do that very well, and we feel like we're one of the best to do that.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Sounds good. And then the 10-Q mentioned a benefit in Global Services from Afghanistan. So can you just clarify the role of Global Services there and maybe what visibility you have to continue to benefit the segment there?","D. Michael Steuert","What we do Afghanistan in Global Services through our equipment business, which just supplied one of our competitors, and that business has been going very well for us. It has been a very healthy profit contributor to our [indiscernible] business, which is part of Global Services.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","And is that expected to continue on or has that kind of reached peak or is it going to...","D. Michael Steuert","I would certainly expect it to continue at least until the end of 2014 as -- because I think we expect ourselves as well as our competition to stay in Afghanistan to -- into 2014 when the troops leave, or at least when they've sort of drawn down somewhat.","David T. Seaton","There was also an agreement signed that extends that -- some sort of commitment of the U.S. government to Afghanistan in the 2024, so I think there's opportunity beyond '14.","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Rygiel with FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Two quick questions. First, is your forecast for a negative $0.20 impact from NuScale for 2012 still intact?","David T. Seaton","Yes.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And secondly, what's the probability that Fluor pursues a similar project to Greater Gabbard now that it's over, over the next 1 to 2 years?","David T. Seaton","Well, we're involved in several consortiums right now, and I'll answer it this way. We've learned an extremely expensive lesson, and we would like to deploy those lessons on one that is contracted differently. We will not take on another one under the terms of which we took Greater Gabbard.","Operator","We'll go next from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Dave, just in terms of the uptick in bookings that you indicated we should see through the year and beyond, it seems as if, I mean, relative to the cycles we've seen in the past, it's a lot more -- not only is it a lot more diverse, but there's a lot more in terms of just incremental work with projects that you're already on as opposed to individual discrete projects. One is, is that fair or just my perception? And what does that mean for margins especially out in the years beyond? I mean, as you spread out, can you leverage that as well?","David T. Seaton","I think so. I think you've got a couple of very, very large programs that are going to be phased, and that's what you've seen, and I think that's a good observation. I do think though that there's a lot of new customers in there, but the projects, unfortunately, aren't the bazillion dollar project that we've seen in some of the cases lately. So when you look at that midlevel project, the $200 million to $500 million project, there's a lot of those in that $8 billion for the quarter, so -- but to get overshadowed because of the big ones. So when you think about diversity of market, diversity of geography, we're able to put in new customers at differing margin positions. So I think as a portfolio, as I've said, I see the markets improving for us and logically, our ability to deliver higher margin to our shareholders of possibility. But again, I'm going to keep using the word lumpiness when we talk about new awards because one of these programs can be 1\/3 of the new award expectation. And if it moves from one quarter to the next or based on a planned award date, you could see some highs and lows even as it relates to the $8 billion that we put on the board this quarter.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And as it relates to specifically to the Power market, you mentioned the gas opportunity. Could you give us a little more color on the size of that over the next couple of years potentially for Fluor?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think there's 2 pieces in Power that, in the near term, will start to gain benefit. One is gas, like you say, and depending on the size of the plant, you're looking at between $600 million and $800 million kind of projects, and we're working on numerous front ends right now on gas-fired power plants. With gas at $2, obviously, gas is, at least, being talked about as baseload power generating capacity and it's easier to permit. I think that we're well positioned on many of those to make those into EPC programs and start to grow our Power group again. The other piece of that is on the environmental compliance side, which is a large part of our Power offering. And we're working with several of the Power producers to look at those regulations and how they impact the generating capacity from coal. Many of our customers are ready to spend money based on the front ends that we've done and others have done to upgrade coal production, to change oversights from coal to some other fuel as well as shut down some of these facilities, all of which fall into our capability. The challenge is, as I mentioned in my prepared statements, we can't get a regulatory environment that has any surety to it that would allow customers to pull that trigger on capital expenditures. That's a huge input into their business model and they need surety. I think the point I would make is that affordable power is the only thing that is going to help overall economic development. Everybody on this call likes to go into their house and flip their light switch and the lights come on; pretty simple. If you look at where some of these regulations are headed, that may not be the case in the future unless you have good regulatory surety and you allow these companies to do what they do best and that's provide that affordable power.","Operator","Our next question comes from Robert Connors with Stifel Nicolaus.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Congratulations again, Mike. And I have another margin question for you before you depart, but I swear it's not around guidance. But if I look at your U.S. pretax margins, you've been secularly up for about a decade versus your foreign pretax margins, which have been sort of secularly down. I'm just wondering if you capture or Fluor captures more scope on North America projects versus on the international side that, that would explain that and if that still the case for some of these petchem projects coming up?","D. Michael Steuert","I really don't think you can split it by North American versus international or non-U.S. Our business is so diverse and each businesses different in terms of this global marketplace in the U.S. and the rest of the world. So there's no real simple answer to that question in terms of margins. Obviously, we go through cycles and all our businesses have entirely different margin profiles.","David T. Seaton","We've also had a margin drag on Gabbard that may be impacting some of the numbers that you're looking at.","D. Michael Steuert","And we have very healthy margins in Global Services and predominantly U.S., we have very healthy margins in some of our DOE work in the U.S. as well. So it varies, but it also have a corporate expenses here, and a lot of other things, so it's really hard to come down to the bottom line question or answer there.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then looking back at some of the contracts won by those predatory Southeast Asian EMCs, would you agree that they tended to be mostly greenfield-type projects where the LSTK model is more applicable...","David T. Seaton","Yes.","Robert F. Norfleet - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Whereas Fluor's reimbursable model is probably better suited to Brownfield expansion and phase projects that you're currently booking because they're more complex with more issues because the client wants as little downtime as possible?","David T. Seaton","I think that's a fair analogy, but I would also say that we can be very effective on greenfield process units too. I think that your categorization is correct if you go back over the last couple of years. When you look at -- just look at Sadara, as an example. There's a big program where the utilities and off-sites, which is the heartbeat of the plant. That's a reimbursable contract with somebody like Fluor where many of the process units are bid out on an LSTK basis.","Robert F. Norfleet - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then just one more. Can you talk about just potential and possibly timeline regarding your ICA Fluor JV providing some offshore fabrication services for some of the Gulf of Mexico prospects that you have as they move from FEED into EPC?","David T. Seaton","They've actually done quite well over the last few years in the tonnages that they've shipped. I can't remember the exact tonnages. But I do know that they've got active bids right now on a lot of tonnage in support of the Gulf of Mexico, primarily for Pemex. But obviously, that translates into other opportunities for other producers than Pemex.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll hear next from Avi Fisher with BMO Capital Markets.","Avram Fisher - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Have you guys ever -- I don't think you've ever disclosed pass-through costs, So I just wondered, 2 quick questions, wonder if you'd ever considered disclosing your pass-through costs, or at least giving us an indication of how much they are in the I&I segment?","David T. Seaton","No.","Avram Fisher - BMO Capital Markets U.S.","Okay. The reason I'm asking is if I just kind of let my model run off based on sort of average rates lately, your revenues just start to exponentially grow, and I just kind of wonder at what point do you start bumping up against capacity in your segments? At what point do we have just too much of a good thing?","David T. Seaton","I don't think we bump up against it. Any -- when I look at the aspirations that I set for the company, I don't see any limiting factor from a capacity perspective. We're able to, as I said, I think we're the employer of choice in our segment and that's a global -- from a global perspective. We've got a very extensive process and tools that allow us to move from designing in Houston to designing in Manila and the designer sitting down at the same protocols, templates and systems, which is not consistent with many of our competitors. So I think our stability of execution model and that diversity is playing well for us. I think when you look at this -- the downturn, so to speak, 2 years ago, 3 years ago in Oil & Gas, we were able to actually strengthen our organization by putting some of those people on -- in different markets around the globe. But it also allowed us to grow that next generation of leader and manager and technical expert. So I don't see us hitting a capacity issue in any form or fashion as we go through the next 2 to 3 years. In fact, I believe that we're going to be able to outpace our competition in that regard.","Operator","And we'll move on now to Randy Bhatia with Capital One.","Randy Bhatia - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Most everything I have has been answered, but I do have a couple of minor ones. If you could -- I don't know if you guys have ever specifically said. I know you have a pretty bullish outlook in the Oil & Gas segment, and particularly in upstream. Can you comment specifically on how you feel Fluor is positioned with regard to North American liquefaction? There\u2019s a lot of news on that. We got a lot of inquiries on that.","David T. Seaton","I think we're well positioned. I think there's a couple of sides of that. Clearly, there are large programs and we have absolute experience and capability in doing those megaprojects. The only piece that we've not been as active as others is on the cryogenic piece, but that's only one piece of that -- of those programs. I think we've also been very active in the re-gasification market around the globe and a lot of the transportation types of assets to both ship and receive gas products is part of our ability. When you think of pipelines, we have a robust capability in the design and construction of pipelines around the globe. that is translatable to North American market. So when you look at the whole gas play, we have the ability from the wellhead -- the wellhead up, we don't do any down-hole stuff, but the gas compression, transportation, the processing, all of the facilities that sit around the liquefaction plant, as you know or may have read, we're teamed with JGC on the pursuit of at least one right now, base load LNG plant, so I think we're pretty well positioned to participate in that market in a very large way.","Randy Bhatia - Capital One Southcoast, Inc., Research Division","Great. And just the other one, circling back on the Greater Gabbard project. Can you give us any kind of like kind of likely outcomes, scenarios and timelines with regard to the legal dispute that you guys talked about in the Q? I know, I mean I heard your prepared remarks, but I mean, what is the legitimate expectation for how long that could play out and could it be material in terms of defense charges or even longer-term earnings charges?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think the -- we're in the process right now that will end up in some sort of an arbitration. There's currently planned for some time this year. Who knows where that's going to go because of the legal wranglings that take place? But I think as I said, we feel very confident on the quality of the asset that we produced for the customer. The customer is enjoying the benefit of the power being produced. Many of the defects that they claim, we have refuted in both word and in technical deed and we feel good about where we stand. But we wanted to finish the project, which we will, except for punch list items and maybe some normal warranty issues, we'll be all but complete as we end the second quarter, which is the plan that we put in place some time ago. Even with the weather issues that we experienced in the first quarter and have already experienced in the second quarter, we're still on track, and we feel very good about the asset that we're leaving behind from a legacy standpoint, and the customer will enjoy revenues -- profitable revenues off of the generating capacity we provided them.","Operator","And we'll hear next from Joe Ritchie of Goldman Sachs.","Gregory Elek - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Greg Elek in for Joe. Just had a couple of quick questions here, and most of my questions have been answered. Just number one on the Power side. I know that NuScale is running in around $0.20 kind of headwind here. Do you believe that there is a possibility of that business kind of being profitable in 2012?","D. Michael Steuert","No.","Gregory Elek - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And in addition to the just adjustment on the tax rate, I just want to make sure that's mainly due to kind of the $0.10 benefit this quarter versus any sort of mix?","D. Michael Steuert","That was really out of an item out of South Africa that impacted the tax rates favorably in the quarter. I'm not sure I\u2019d calculate the benefit that high, but where our normal tax rate is. We had a couple of things in the quarter, and the way I kind of view it is the favorable tax rate pretty much offset the unfavorable and unexpected in terms of what we got on indices. Where we took -- I think we disclosed the 13 -- roughly $13 million charge there. Those 2 were pushed and I think the bottom line is we came very close to your consensus.","Gregory Elek - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Great. I got it. And I just one last question, a little bit more kind of bigger picture here. I know that shale gas and your opportunity is kind of a big theme right now, and clearly, you're very well positioned around petrochem, LNG, natural gas firepower. It would be great if you could give us a better sense in terms of timing of which opportunity is kind of for each one of those opportunities for yourselves and where you kind of potentially see the biggest points in ramp whether that's 13, '14, versus today?","David T. Seaton","I believe first out of the basket would be petrochemicals. I think that you've seen a huge shift in the belief that it is a long-term profitable opportunity for our customers in that market with sub-$4 gas. So we're very active right now on the front-end FEEDs on both greenfield or new ethylene cracker complexes, but just as heavily involved in the revamp nature of a lot of the assets that have been starved for capital over the last decade. So I think that's the first mover. I think the gas-fired power is again, it's held up in the regulatory mire that we find ourselves in. And then I think liquefaction is probably last on that list except for maybe one of the programs that it's kind of maybe a little bit ahead of the others. But I would put them in that sequence of benefit for us.","Operator","And with that being our final question, I will hand the conference back over to Mr. David Seaton for any additional or closing remarks.","David T. Seaton","Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for participating this afternoon. We really appreciate the interest you have in our company. As you've gathered from our comments today, we're very pleased with our performance in the first quarter, which included a significantly strong new award quarter. We have a very strong prospect list for the balance of the year, but again, I'll keep reminding everyone of the inherent lumpiness quarter-over-quarter on the new awards. I want to take one last opportunity again to thank Mike for his outstanding leadership over the past 11 years. And again, welcome, Biggs, to the Fluor team. I'm very pleased to have had such a strong successor to Mike, and we look forward to getting an opportunity to introduce Biggs to all of you in the near future. Again, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company, and as well as the confidence that you show in Fluor. And I wish all of you a good day.

And it was that loyalty that drove me to accept the position for the Executive Chairman, and also because I felt that I could team with Carlos to successfully address our issues. In my previous tenure as a CEO, I hope that I earned a reputation for strong execution and transparent communications. So it\u2019s with that in mind that I began this discussion.","If you would, please turn to Slide 3. On the 1st of May, the Board of Directors appointed me as Executive Chairman and Carlos as Chief Executive Officer. They then commissioned us to effect a complete review of the business. The first and major part of our review was to meet and talk with the business group leaders regarding their project teams, clients, suppliers and subcontractors, to allow us to assess all of the risk projects in our backlog.","The second part of our assignment was to evaluate and modify as necessary our bidding and execution strategies to ensure that going forward we can have a high quality and reliably profitable backlog. Next, we assessed the organization, its leadership and its governance to make sure that we had the right team and structure in place.","Several major investments that you\u2019re aware of have been made in the last few years. Our next task was to take a critical look at the performance of these investments and recommend any necessary actions. Now given recent project losses, we also engaged in a review of our balance sheet, our cash flow and liquidity.","The last part of our review was regarding our current portfolio of businesses. We have begun our analysis in each of the business lines and its position and performance within our corporation. This will result in a recommendation to our Board of Directors of what we believe to be the optimal mix of markets and services that should comprise Fluor Corporation. As you can see, this was a comprehensive assignment. And for the last three months, we have been relentless in looking into every aspect of what I\u2019ve just outlined.","One of our first actions was to bring back Mike Steuert, our CFO. Mike, as many of you know, previously served as our CFO from 2001 until 2012, and rejoined Fluor in June. We also engaged Lazard as a strategic advisor. These two critical moves have given us significant leverage in assessing our situation and options. Our review included a strategic session in June with our entire Board, in which we discussed our initial findings and outlined the initiatives that we are pursuing.","Recognizing that today we have a lot to accomplish on this call, let me start by outlining the order of our presentation. First of all, I will begin with a summary of actions taken by Fluor\u2019s Board of Directors. Then I will turn the call over to Carlos to brief you regarding the status of our finding and actions today in this strategic review. Lastly, you\u2019ll hear from Mike Steuert, our Chief Financial Officer, as he provides a financial update and his initial priorities.","Carlos and I have met with many of you in our buy and sell side community, as well as clients and employees. We\u2019ve listened to what our stakeholders are saying and we\u2019re using this feedback as a guide for the changes that we are making inside our company. The issues we are discussing today are serious, but I am convinced that they are solvable.","I also recognize that our markets have changed and I have personally observed the clients today have transferred significant risk and liabilities to contractors, and this has impacted our entire sector. But very importantly, I also believe that Fluor does not have to accept these risks, and we are working with our clients to better balance these in future contracts. We can also achieve project success when all of our employees have a commercial mindset, they have a strong understanding of the contractual requirements and employ our strategic vision, which is an unwavering commitment to safety, costs competitive innovation and excellence and execution.","But before we get to the quarterly results, I want to update the investment community about recent actions by the Fluor Board of Directors. If you would, I\u2019ll ask you to please turn to Slide 4.","Our Board absolutely recognizes the gravity of this announcement and has taken steps to improve our visibility into the contracting process, including the risks that we\u2019re assuming in new projects, as well as how we are approaching and executing our existing risk projects. At yesterday\u2019s Board meeting, the Board formed a risk committee led by Jim Hackett. This committee\u2019s role is to assist the Board in fulfilling its risk oversight responsibilities. It will oversee and review with management, the risk framework and regularly monitor compliance. We believe this committee will enhance the Board that exercise of its duties and keeping with our mandate of good corporate governance.","And lastly, while we have a very strong Board, the challenges and market conditions that Fluor is facing today require that we initiate a process to bring on individuals who have additional capital project and industry expertise. We will not be increasing the size of the Board, but expect to announce at least two new members by the end of September.","While these initial efforts are a start in the right direction, they\u2019re only a portion of the changes that we intend to make. We expect to include, conclude our strategic review within the next eight weeks and to explain our path forward in detail during a webcast on September 24 at 8:00 AM Eastern Time. I encourage all of you to put that date and time on your calendar.","And with that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Carlos to talk more about our operations, progress on changing our strategy and what he\u2019s been doing to meet the Board\u2019s expectations. Carlos?","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you, Alan. Let me start by sharing with you the actions we\u2019ve taken during my first quarter as CEO, and provide you some details on our path forward. To begin, I\u2019ve made a number of changes to improve the effectiveness of Fluor\u2019s executive team. Please turn to Slide 5, please.","In addition to bringing Mike back as CFO, I appointed Mark Fields as the President of our Energy & Chemicals segment. Mark has nearly 40 years of experience including extensive mega-project execution and upstream, refining, mining, chemicals and petrochemicals. Also, we have separated infrastructure into a standalone business segment to increase transparency with Terry Towle as Group President reporting directly to me. Terry has been operationally responsible for 11 infrastructure projects over the last 10 years.","Finally, we have moved risk management under long time Fluor executive Garry Flowers and expanded his authority to enhance reporting and accountability of this group. Garry is particularly well suited for this role as he has provided support and has been instrumental in developing resolution strategies on a number of challenging projects during his career. As Alan mentioned, we have a heightened focused on our risk profile. We have increased transparency and accountability throughout the organization. Please turn to Slide 6.","It has become apparent to me that there a few significant and common issues in many of our challenged projects. In May, we immediately implemented a more rigorous framework to our pursuit process. We have already enacted changes in our bid, no bid process so that our future backlog will be comprised of high quality projects, where the contract structure and execution approach that will generate improved risk adjusted margins. To that end we have set the following pursuit criteria for new projects.","For Energy & Chemicals, we will only pursue fixed-price work, where there is a limited bid slate and we have identified a quantifiable advantage over other bidders, or where it is a sole-sourced negotiated lump sum agreement. We will only bid on projects where Fluor executed the FEED package or otherwise was allowed to perform sufficient diligence.","In Infrastructure, we will focus our efforts in North America and continue to extend our presence in states, where we have an established track record and strong DOT relationships. These include Texas, Arizona, California, Virginia and North Carolina. In the Government segment, we will no longer pursue lump sum projects. For lump sum projects, the terms and conditions must have an appropriate allocation of risk between client and contractor. And in ALL cases, risk projects will be subject to an initial bid, no bid approval followed by later final approval by the Fluor executive team. This increased focused on selectivity will change the profile of our prospect pipeline because it is important that we drive our company into a backlog and execution platform that can deliver consistent results.","Although the trend in our industry is to pivot away from lump sum work, we still believe that Fluor has the talent and expertise to win and execute these projects albeit on a more selective basis, but it\u2019s simply. We\u2019re focusing on profitability and cash generation, will not bid on large scale lump sum projects that don\u2019t meet our criteria. But there are lump sum projects that do meet our new standards. If we are successful, for example, on being awarded the Rovuma LNG project, I can assure you that this project has gone through increased scrutiny by Fluor and adheres to our newly revised risk management approach.","With regard to our current backlog, one thing that has become exceedingly clear to me is that we must take a more disciplined approach to risk assessment on our projects. We have identified our challenges and outlined what needs to be done. Additionally, we\u2019re making changes to how we approach engineering and project management to ensure our projects are staying in sequence with work not commencing until the appropriate reviews are complete.","During the second quarter, the company met with a number of our clients, subcontractors and suppliers in an attempt to resolve a number of matters. These include ongoing disputes, ending change orders, schedule extensions, closeout items, unpaid receivables and our position on outstanding claims.","As a result of these discussions, client settlements and revised estimates to complete projects, the company evaluated its position on a number of projects, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $714 million. These charges impact a broad range of projects including certain projects that remain profitable. Furthermore, our margins will be lower than normal based on the timing of awards in our proposed \u2013 in our prospect pipeline and the impact of projects discussed today.","Now if you would please turn to Slide 8. In Energy & Chemicals, results for the quarter include an additional project adjustment of $186 million relating to an offshore project. You have heard us talk about the offshore project over the last two quarters, and the challenges we have faced as a result of significant growth from a FEED package from others.","As a result of the revised and approved design guidelines, we determined in the quarter that we will not be able to meet the completion deadline as indicated in our contract. While we continue to engage our clients in regards to execution strategy, we must recognize the cost associated with missing the initial project completion date and other identified expenses. Results also include additional charges totaling $87 million, resulting from schedule driven cost growth and client and subcontractor negotiations on two fixed price downstream projects as well as scope reductions on a large upstream project.","On a positive note, we want every reimbursable EPFC contract for a refinery expansion project in the United Kingdom. We were also awarded the FEED package for INEOS\u2019 new processing plant in the United Kingdom, which is a part of their broader strategic investment in the region. We are excited to be part of these projects. Regarding our LNG Canada project, we\u2019re on track with the overall project schedule and budget. In the second quarter we completed the last 30% module reviews and continued site preparation and construction of the Cedar Valley Lodge Worker Accommodation Center.","During the third quarter, we will be progressing engineering, continuing site preparation and commencing construction of the material offloading facility. We remain on schedule to release module design packages to our fabrication yard in Q1 of 2020. Well this project has taken into backlog at the end of 2018 we have completed additional reviews and can confirm that LNG Canada conforms to the revised risk criteria we announced today.","We\u2019re also moving forward with the Formosa Sunshine project in Louisiana. Our team is working on the FEED components for several parts of this mega facility, and continuing to put together proposals for other pieces of the plant. We expect to see in the second half of 2019 a reimbursable EPC award for the utilities, offsite, infrastructures and logistics portion of this project. We\u2019re able to leverage experience we have in this area to more effectively forecast labor and equipment costs.","And finally, in E&C you have heard us talk about two large Methanol projects, that we expected to win in 2019. Unfortunately, one of these projects South Louisiana Methanol was indefinitely delayed by the client this quarter. This was disappointing to us and obviously affects our new awards outlook for E&C this year. We expect that the Lake Charles Methanol project will move forward early next year.","Now if you would turn to Slide 9 please. In the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment results for the quarter include project adjustments of $109 million on three gas-fired power projects and $55 million on several infrastructure projects, including the Purple Line in Maryland.","With regard to the power projects, we have final agreements with our clients where both sides are absolved from future liability other than standard warranty coverage. Thus we are pleased to say, that these projects are finally behind us with no remaining material exposure to gas-fired power in our backlog. You may have seen some news articles about the MTA Purple Line project in Maryland, and some challenges our joint venture has faced to keep this project progressing on schedule due to illegal and right away delays. We have revised our project forecast based on increases to our cost forecast and changes to the timeline.","We announced this quarter award of a $1.7 billion I-635 LBJ East Infrastructure project here in Dallas. This project is the largest example of our strong relationship, latest example of our strong relationship with TXDOT. We recently won a $263 million project with North Carolina Department of Transportation on Interstate 26 near Asheville. We expect to book both awards in the third quarter. In mining, we\u2019re starting to see the FEED and feasibility work we have been completing over the last year, come to fruition. In the second quarter, we booked over 300 million of work in copper mining projects alone.","Now if you would turn to Slide 10. In the Government group, results for the quarter include a charge of $233 million for a government project on which the company serves as a subcontractor to a commercial client, but this commercial client who is providing EPC services for several new structures on an existing site. The charge we\u2019re taking on a project is substantially driven by late engineering changes, cost growth and project change orders that have been rejected. As a sub contractor on this project, we continue to work with the prime contractor to resolve these matters. The project is expected to complete at the end of 2020.","In the second quarter we won a nine-month extension to the LOGCAP IV contract in Afghanistan. We recently announced our 14 month extension of our M&O contract at the Savannah River site in South Carolina and will book our portion of this award in the third quarter. Also later this year, we expect to hear about both the Tank Closure Contract and the Central Plateau Contract at the Hanford site for the DOE.","Now if you would please turn to Slide 11. In Diversified Services, our store structuring that we announced last quarter is well underway and going very well. Our restructuring will be substantially complete by the end of the year. This quarter, a Stork-led consortium was awarded a four year framework agreement for plant turn around services for Ecopetrol on two refineries in Colombia.","Now turning to our equipment rental company AMECO. We\u2019re exiting our operations in Mexico and in selected international countries. Exiting these low to negative margin map markets will result in a restructuring charge of approximately $120 million, with $37 million recognized this quarter. We expect to receive cash of approximately $90 million as a result of this restructuring effort.","And finally, we\u2019re evaluating the rest of our organizations. See what offerings our end markets are not consistent with our goals to drive long-term value for our shareholders. All options are on the table and we will tell you the results of this review on our September 24 call.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Mike to give some financial updates from the quarter. Mike?","Mike Steuert","Thank you, Carlos. And again, welcome to our second quarter conference call. Like Alan. I returned to Fluor based on my loyalty to the company and along with Alan and Carlos, I am committed to returning Fluor to industry leading performance. Since you can read about our results for the quarter in our earnings release in 10-Q filed this afternoon, I will focus on several key matters. First charges in the quarter.","Please turn to Slide 12. Results for the quarter include $669 million of project charges, $46 million for ongoing restructuring efforts in Diversified Services, $26 million for pre-contract costs, and $19 million for the elimination of the embedded foreign currency derivatives related to the company\u2019s joint venture in Mexico. As Carlos mentioned, and as stated in our earnings released in 10-Q, these charges are in large part the result of management\u2019s efforts to resolve or at least progress a number of project matters during the quarter.","Some matters have been resolved or a near resolution. However, in spite of our extremely diligent efforts to quantify risks this quarter, risk remains in our backlog in any additional project challenges could impact future results. In addition, the cost of actions to be taken as a result of our ongoing strategic review may also negatively impact future quarters. Consequently, we will not be providing guidance for 2019.","Shifting to the balance sheet, Fluor\u2019s cash plus marketable securities for the quarter totaled $1.9 billion, essentially flat to last quarter. Available domestic cash balance was approximately 20% of total cash and marketable securities. Our capital structure remains solid and we have substantial liquidity.","In addition to our cash, we have committed lines of credit at $3.5 billion, approximately half of which is available for drawings. We have plenty of room under our key covenant in the credit agreement and even if the lines are fully drawn, we have plenty of room, and they did not mature until 2022. Further, the first significant tranche of our long-term debt does not mature until 2023. However our credit ratings have declined and we\u2019ll certainly come under pressure this quarter. We are committed to reversing this trend and strengthening Fluor\u2019s financial position. As Carlo said, we are looking at all options and we\u2019ll provide an update on our September 24 call.","Please turn to Slide 13. Our priorities to accomplish this goal, our cash flow generation, improving Fluor\u2019s cost profile and operating efficiency and enhancing our return on investment through focused asset management.","The first is cash flow generation. Cash flow from operations in the quarter totaled $109 million. Cash flow from operations for the second half of the year is likely to be negative as we continue to fund the trouble projects that we have discussed today. Future sources of positive cash flow will be selected assets sales and divestitures, including real estate as well as the collection of project receivables, change orders and claims.","Moving to the underlying cost profile of our businesses, a number of options are being explored as part of the strategic review. These include optimizing our global real estate footprint, improved discipline around overhead expenses and rebalancing staffing levels to meet the evolving demands of our clients.","Please turn to Slide 14. Regards to improving our return on investments, I, along with Executive Management and the Board had been reviewing three major investments that Fluor made over the past few years, the first, historic, our O&M business that we housed in Diversified Services.","Last quarter, the company announced a restructuring of the business that is still underway and is on track. These restructuring efforts respond to a shift in the type of services to mandate by our clients. This quarter we took a restructuring charge of $9 million related to anticipated asset divestitures in severance. We took a $27 million restructuring costs last quarter, anticipated taking another $14 million of restructuring costs in the next two quarters. With these changes, we believe that the business will be appropriately sized and positioned to further add value for our broader organization.","Next, I want to talk about a COOEC joint venture fabrication yard. We still believe this facility provides flexibility and schedule certainty required to execute large fixed-price contracts, most notably LNG Canada. That being said, we want to make sure that this investment is operated and structured in a manner that allows us to achieve appropriate returns. The yard currently lacks volume with appropriate mix of work and they continue to be a modest drag on earnings for the balance of 2019. We have started conversations with our partner on how to best restructure this investment to bring in new work on a profitable basis while reducing our exposure.","And finally, NuScale. Last week, NuScale announced that SMR design had cleared the NRC. Second and third phases of review six weeks ahead of schedule. The NRC remains on track to complete this review by September 2020 and our first potential customers is planning a 12-module SMR plant in Idaho. NuScale has also signed MOUs to explore the deployment of its technology in a number of countries, and discussions are underway with other potential customers.","As you may have seen, Doosan Heavy Industries & Construction along Sargent & Lundy has signed agreements to invest in NuScale. These new investors are expected to fund the cash requirements for the balance of 2019. We are encouraged by this progress and are open to adding additional investors to fund requirements beyond 2019.","Please turn to Slide 15. As I mentioned, we are not providing updated guidance for the second half of 2019. However, there are a couple of cost estimates we can guide to. These include expected corporate G&A expense of approximately $100 million excluding restructuring charges and pension settlements, both of which are likely to be significant. No additional funding for NuScale in the second half of the year due to the recent and pending new investment from Doosan and Sargent & Lundy. Following CFIUS approval of these investments, we will no longer be incurring expenses for the remainder of this year.","And finally, turning to Slide 16, as it relates to our business segments. When comparing the second half of 2019 to the second half of 2018, we expect that Energy & Chemicals revenue will decrease 15% to 20% with modest improvement operating profit margins; mining, industrial, infrastructure and power revenue growth of 30% to 40%, primarily due to mining with operating profit margins in a 2% to 3% range; government revenue to decrease by approximately 5% with operating profit margins of 3%, excluding NuScale; and diversified services revenue growth of 8% to 10% with flat margin.","With that operator, we\u2019re ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Andy Kaplowitz with Citi. Please go ahead.","Andy Kaplowitz","Good evening, guys. Mike, welcome back.","Mike Steuert","Thank you.","Andy Kaplowitz","So Alan, I know you said there, before with Carlos, I know you said there could be more risks in our backlog \u2013 in your backlog, but The Street has wondered whether you actually created that they\u2019re not getting sides of the charges you took, obviously resolving disagreements between settlement, but could you give us more color into how you looked at your contracts differently? And if it\u2019s possible, could you give us any examples of how you\u2019ve really estimated productivity on projects and did you understand the level of conservatism in your estimate?","Carlos Hernandez","Sure. Let me just comment on the several events that took place this quarter as resulted in the charge. For example, on the power projects, we were able to reach settlement agreement with the client. And as a result of that, we\u2019re taking a charge of about $109 million and taking some positive and receiving some positive cash flow. With respect to certain estimates of cost to complete on the couple of projects, those were looked at this quarter given the progress that has been made, particularly with respect to engineering, which oftentimes drives \u2013 which drives other factors such as procurement and materials that need to be acquired. And those were re-estimated on that basis.","As far as contracts, we have a number and as it is common in every project of change orders on various projects and we evaluate those products \u2013 those change orders, we discussed them with the client and we reach conclusions on where we are with respect to the government project, for example, we have a number of change orders that are outstanding and we met with a client and made a judgment as to whether we should take the charge at this time and we decided that we should. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not going to pursue those change orders at a later date, but we thought it was prudent to do so at this time.","In another factor that we sometimes look at, and obviously with respect to these estimates, there\u2019s a degree of judgment that is exercised. And we\u2019ve tighten the assumptions a little bit. And as a result of that, perhaps took some charges that are reflected in the $714 million of charges this quarter.","Andy Kaplowitz","Okay. Thanks for that color. How should we think about Fluor\u2019s ability to win major projects and grow backlog going forward? First of all, how favorable do you still think the overall oil and gas and mining markets are at this point? And you talked about some project delays. Do you still believe that we\u2019re in a project upsale? And then are you actually in retrenchment mode [indiscernible] some of major potential awards that are out there, or do you still think you can grow backlog in the industry and in the mining infrastructure business?","Carlos Hernandez","Well, a couple of things. Certainly, we think we are well positioned to win work. And it\u2019s no secret that the industry has suffered severely over the last couple of years given what has happened in shifting of risk from clients to contractors. And the industry is getting more selective, but we\u2019re going to \u2013 and we\u2019re getting more selective as well, but we think we\u2019re well positioned to win work.","For example, right now we have a backlog of $35 billion. We expect over the second half of this year for our backlog to grow perhaps to $40 billion. And with respect to this backlog growth that we\u2019re expecting, we\u2019re very comfortable with the kinds of projects that we\u2019re \u2013 that we are expecting to win. We are, let\u2019s assume for example, that we are award with the Rovuma project in Mozambique. That project has gone through a screen filter that\u2019s consistent and compatible with the new rules of the road that we have established. So we\u2019re very comfortable with that. We also have some other, for example, we have some other lump sum project that we\u2019re pursuing but those are negotiated lump sum. So while our backlog would probably increase a little bit in terms of lump sum, it\u2019ll be lump sum that we feel comfortable with.","Andy Kaplowitz","And Mike, if I could just squeeze a quick one in on cash. You mentioned cash would be negative in the second half of 2019, cash from operations, but could you actually have an outflow next year given the project charges you\u2019re taking now?","Mike Steuert","That\u2019s a great question. We do expect modest negative cash outflow this year as a result of project charges, but we will also be seeing some inflow from our ongoing operations. For next year, there will definitely be some additional negative outflow from the projects, but we also have our base core business that will be generating cash throughout the year. And our net cash position next year will, to a large extent, really depend on our actions based on a strategic review that we are \u2013 that\u2019s underway currently.","And I certainly expect those actions, plus ongoing cash management activities where we\u2019re really looking at all of our excess real estate. We\u2019re looking at other assets that can be liquidated. We\u2019re doing a number of things to enhance our cash position. So I would expect overall, I\u2019d be very, very disappointed if we cannot generate significant amounts of cash in 2020.","Andy Kaplowitz","Thanks, guys.","Carlos Hernandez","You bet.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. Sorry, good evening. A couple of questions. One, just on the charges that you took on the problem projects, is there any way you can help us disclose the dollar amount of backlog, which is associated with the problem projects? How many are there? You highlighted some, but there were more in infrastructure, you didn\u2019t highlight the number. And then what percent complete those projects are?","To my second question is, in terms of how we\u2019re thinking about the strategic review, when you guys were first down the road, you talked about cutting investment and restructuring store, you talked about COOEC. You talked about NuScale, you talked about real estate, but I\u2019m just wondering how extensive this review is now that we have Lazard as a strategic advisor to whether we\u2019re considering broader portfolio changes relative to what we announced before given the magnitude and the pervasiveness of the charges that we\u2019ve seen?","So I guess \u2013 and then last, like in \u2013 in what world can we get comfortable with LNG Canada given what we\u2019ve just seen today?","Carlos Hernandez","Okay. Jamie, you\u2019ve asked all the questions I expected you to ask. And let me take \u2013 let me start. 75% of the charges that we took this quarter relate to two projects, the offshore project and the government project, as well as the closeout of the power projects. With respect to the infrastructure project, and by the way, the power project is about, I mean, sorry, the government project is about 50% complete. The offshore project is a little bit higher than that in terms of completion.","With respect to the infrastructure projects, the largest charge there is the Purple Line project in Maryland, which we discussed in the earlier remarks. With respect to the rest of the infrastructure charges, they\u2019re all small charges that we probably wouldn\u2019t have spoken about, but from a fact that they all add up, the total adds up to about $55 million. And some of those projects that we take in small charges are not even in a loss position.","With respect to the strategic review that we\u2019re engaged in, as we said, everything\u2019s on the table. We\u2019re going to be looking at capital structure, dividends, assets, portfolio everything that you can imagine to be in a position to report back on the September 24 call. Alan, I don\u2019t know if you want to add anything to that?","Alan Boeckmann","No, I think that\u2019s right, Carlos. Jamie, this last three months, we\u2019ve been incredibly busy, working with our business unit lines, going through the backlog, addressing all of the risk projects. We\u2019ve been progressing in our position on each of the investments and putting a significant focus on those. We also have \u2013 and Carlos has done a really excellent effort in providing some pretty stringent selectivity criteria and then enforcing that and working through the organization just to make sure that we are being much more highly selective in addressing these risks. That\u2019s taken a tremendous amount of effort in this quarter.","But in respect to the other parts of our portfolio, we have also been assessing that. We\u2019re not in a position in the announcement right now that it requires additional work. We are looking this that some efforts that will reduce our overall cost footprint, Mike mentioned some of those. But I would say on September 24, we\u2019re going to be able to tell you what this business \u2013 what the business portfolio of this company should be, what each of them represent and contribute to the total of Fluor and which ones that we think we can \u2013 we have to have in an optimum situation.","So, we don\u2019t mean to avoid that question at all, it\u2019s just that we\u2019re just not ready to make those decisions yet because of the analysis that\u2019s going on. But you should rest assured that we\u2019re looking at the entire portfolio","Jamie Cook","And then Alan, on LNG Canada, given what you guys have seen so far, it\u2019s too early to possibly get comfortable with that project. Like how do I respond to that when investors ask me about?","Alan Boeckmann","Yes. LNG Canada, as I mentioned, we\u2019re \u2013 it\u2019s early in the project still. We\u2019re still on, on schedule and on budget. We brought up a number of experts to augment our critical activity there. We have Mark Fields, who was there two days or three days after he got appointed Head of E&C. Mike and I have now joined the Board of Directors of that joint venture. We are dedicating all of our resources to that project. And at this point, we believe that that project has, would pass our \u2013 with new \u2013 pursuit the requirements that we\u2019ve implemented now. So this point, we\u2019re comfortable with that project.","Jamie Cook","All right, I\u2019ll let someone get in there. Thank you.","Alan Boeckmann","Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS. Please go ahead.","Steven Fisher","Great, thanks, and good evening. Given the \u2013 you guys, given the breadth of everything you had to accomplish, do you think that two to three months was enough time to really do everything that you needed to do specifically on the backlog reviews? Like was it as absolutely thorough as it could be or did you have to kind of rush it at all to kind of be prepared for today?","Alan Boeckmann","Steve, they have worked their Chairman extremely hard.","Carlos Hernandez","I can assure you, Steve, we brought project that we have touched, we have gone thoroughly and deeply to it. And that\u2019s not to say that we won\u2019t be doing that for the next several quarters or so project completion. And that\u2019s not to say, as you know, we can\u2019t say that everything is done on each of these projects, but we have at this point we are very comfortable with where we are based on the information we have now.","Now, some of these \u2013 but there\u2019s one project that where the engineering has caused us to \u2013 have to increase our cost forecast, and that engineering is not complete. I don\u2019t expect it, I mean, I can\u2019t say that\u2019s going to have additional charges, but until the engineering is complete there\u2019s always a possibility of that. But we have worked long and hard the last three months. We\u2019ve talked to clients, we\u2019ve visited the project sites, we\u2019ve talked to our project people. It has been an all out effort.","Mike Steuert","Steve, let me give you an example of our effort. In my prior life at quarter-end, I\u2019d have one review with all the group CFOs and go through the numbers and make sure they\u2019re comfortable. The last two months we had three rounds of reviews with all the group controllers and CFOs. We brought them in. We sat down for long periods of time on three different occasions to make sure that that we and they were comfortable with the accounting and the assessment of risk this quarter. That was \u2013 as Carlos said, it was very intense effort.","Steven Fisher","Okay. I\u2019m wondering if you can help us understand the likely path of margins from here, particularly in the E&C business because that\u2019s the one, if you look at the guidance that you have for the second half of this year relative to what maybe we should think would be normalized, has perhaps the most room for upside. So really kind of wondering how all this affects 2020. And, yes, should we expect as we go get into the first quarter and the first half of 2020 that that we should see still a step up significantly in margins as you do execute the LNG Canada project and get through some of the other things that are dragging on the margins?","Mike Steuert","And as you look at the remainder of this year and 2020, obviously the one offshore project will be a drag on margins. But the rest of the business we should expect a modest improvement in margins this year and that will continue into 2020 as we see the rest of the business moving through the backlog and get burned.","Steven Fisher","But on the E&C business, I mean, does that mean, can we get back to like a 5% to 6% margin in 2020 or is that off the table at this point?","Mike Steuert","I think it\u2019s going to take a little longer to get back to that level of margin site. I think we\u2019ll see modest improvement this year and the modest improvement next year.","Steven Fisher","Got it. All right, thanks a lot.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Tahira Afzal","Good evening, folks.","Alan Boeckmann","Hi, Tahira.","Carlos Hernandez","Good evening.","Tahira Afzal","So I guess as a first question, you\u2019ve got some interesting partners now on NuScale, both of them have nuclear capabilities as well as expertise. Strategically, if you look out, where do you see their roles potentially going versus yourself?","Mike Steuert","Well, Tahira, first of all, we\u2019re very pleased that we\u2019ve gotten an investment that\u2019s going to eliminate any funding obligation from Flour for the balance of this year, maybe into the beginning of next year once we get CPS approval. But we have noted a significant increase in investor interest in NuScale and we are pursuing discussions with other investors currently.","So, the fact that we\u2019ve gone through two recent gate reviews with NRC and we have passed them and we\u2019re expecting NRC approval, I believe it\u2019s late 2020, it makes us \u2013 it gives us a lot of confidence that we\u2019ll be able to attract investors in the next six months to a year.","Tahira Afzal","All right, thank you. And I know a lot of these very important milestones and modular technology are getting lost in all the noise, so obviously, it\u2019s annoying to see that for yourself. I guess the second question for me, there have been several other construction companies that are facing and struggling with productivity issues and constipations. And some of them have been pretty vocal that they\u2019re trying to get some resources from Canada. I guess my concern is even though you\u2019re doing more modular construction for LNG Canada, are you being very watchful on showing up all the expertise units on ground?","Carlos Hernandez","Absolutely. That\u2019s one of the things that Mark has enhanced to even since he took over, and he\u2019s bringing resources to that project from other locations to enhance our capabilities there.","Tahira Afzal","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research. Please go ahead.","Michael Dudas","Good evening everybody, and appreciate all the frankness and the openness you\u2019ve shared with us this evening.","Carlos Hernandez","Thanks, Mike. Thank you.","Michael Dudas","I guess Alan and Carlos, what were the common themes that you learned from your discussions with the client base, with your management\u2019s, with the employees, with vendors that surprise you or got you to this point of, wow, we got \u2013 not Houston, but Dallas, we have a problem other than obviously the issues that we reported today in the second quarter.","Alan Boeckmann","Like one of the things that we\u2019ve done is, Carlos and I have met with a lot of the CEOs of our clients. And it\u2019s an interesting \u2013 it\u2019s an interesting situation where they understand the issues that are occurring in our industry. They see the damage has been done to the sector. And they actually talk pretty openly about the need for a win-win situation I\u2019m trying to correct that balance. I will tell you though, one of the things that we\u2019ve had in our discussion just pointing out to them, that hasn\u2019t always flow down through their supply chain, is that I\u2019m sure that doesn\u2019t surprise you. But we still and I\u2019ve had two conversations just in the last week, where I\u2019ve gone back up the chain and talked to the top of the company about the, that misdirection or that miss misalignment in the risk review.","So we\u2019re going to push on that. I think as Fluor we can be selective. And I think that we \u2013 not only can we be selective, as you\u2019ve noticed all of the other announcements in this industry, there are actually people leaving it. There are people that are curtailing there. They\u2019re selectivity criteria as well. I actually think that\u2019s good for us. If we can be disciplined, and we can be selective, I actually think that it creates a better situation for us going forward. But we do have to be disciplined. I\u2019ll let Carlos address the rest of your questions.","Carlos Hernandez","Let me comment on what has happened internally within the company. In the last couple of weeks, for example, we have made decisions not to bid projects that we probably would have bid previously. We have also changed our bids on a couple of projects to be noncompliant, but on a basis that we believe we can execute effectively. And we have established \u2013 we establishing a new discipline in this regard, we\u2019re not going to take projects where we are going to be bidding against the number of other competitors and we don\u2019t have a quantifiable advantage. And even when we have a quantifiable advantage, it\u2019s going to be when there\u2019s a very limited sight competitors. So this is a change that\u2019s quickly being, that\u2019s resonating throughout the company and every, every risk project comes to me for approval along with my management team and everybody\u2019s on board with that.","Michael Dudas","I appreciate that, those thoughts. And I guess, Alan, to your point on the CEOs of the clients and the customer base, is this a secular \u2013 I mean, this cyclicality in risk transfer from contractor to client over the cycles, but is this somehow more secular, some other, something else being driven by this? Or will it be cyclical when let more people pull out of the business and types of capacity, and then it\u2019ll be a better situation? And how does Fluor as the size of the company and where you\u2019re focused on today, can be most effective for that to generate the returns that\u2019s going to be required to improve your share price?","Alan Boeckmann","Mike, that\u2019s an excellent question. This really started, and actually I saw it from the other side, when I was at the Board of an oil and gas company; when the oil price dropped so precipitously several years ago, that\u2019s when the oil \u2013 all of the oil companies moved strongly to cut their costs. And one of the first places they did that was with their suppliers and contractors. I think that was the start of the initiative. And it\u2019s just continued since then.","In fact they had brought in consultants and so forth to work with their supply chain to continue to perfect that. I do believe that the changes now that are occurring in the industry, the problems that have occurred has woken these companies. And we\u2019ve seen a realization of it. I do believe that what we\u2019re going to do and our actions will actually help drive some momentum in that regard. But other companies are joining this quite frankly. But I think we can lead that effort with our brand and with our global reach and we intend to do this.","Michael Dudas","Thank you, Alan. Thank you, Carlos.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Jerry Revich","Hi, good afternoon and good evening everyone. Carlos, I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about where you folks drew the line in the sand in terms of projects that you\u2019re monitoring but then take charges on, for example, projects like Tappan Zee, where there\u2019s dispute with them, with the owners and projects like that. Just can you help us build a comfort level that there aren\u2019t another number of projects that we\u2019re monitoring that didn\u2019t meet the threshold where we took charges that, where it\u2019s possible going forward?","Carlos Hernandez","Yes, sure. First of all on Tappan Zee, I believe we took a small charge this quarter. We have a \u2013 and we do have a dispute with a client and a claim there which we have a legal basis to do, to pursue. So where we have a high level of confidence and comfort, Jerry, we will not take a charge, but in this case, we don\u2019t have very many other projects where we have claims that we believe are at risk. So as I said earlier, we took a very hard look and within the range of reasonableness we got a little bit more conservative.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And then in terms of the charges that we saw this quarter, what are the cash payments that are going to be necessary where they go along with those charges or have a substantial portion of them effectively already been paid for via working capital growth. Can you help us understand that?","Carlos Hernandez","There are substantial future cash payments from some of the charges, probably in the $200 million to $300 million range for this year and then into the first part of next year. But again, we will have cash flow from rest of our operations offset a good portion of that. But there are some charges associated with projects that will actually result in positive cash flow. The Duke power is an example where we took some charges, but we expect to receive cash from the client. The restructuring activities for the AMECO, Mexico and the Caribbean, we took some restructuring charges, but as we liquidate those assets will have positive cash flow. So up, not all of the actions that we took will result in negative cash flow, similar results in positive cash flow with the future.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And as we look at the implied earnings range of the back half margin commentary that you folks laid out, that implies earnings run rate in the low $2 range. As we think about heading into the strategic review discussion in two months. I would assume that, that\u2019s the starting point for the earnings power of the business and then we\u2019ll look at strategic options from there. Is that the right starting point or would you make any observations relative to where we\u2019re going to be exiting in the year?","Carlos Hernandez","Given all the moving parts of this quarter plus the next two quarters, as we go through our strategic review, I really, I don\u2019t think is wise for us to give guidance relative to those starting point. I think we need to go through our strategic review and go through our fall assessment of 2020 and get more of a comfortable as we complete this year to be given guidance as a starting point for looking at next year.","Jerry Revich","Okay. I appreciate the discussion. Thanks.","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you, Jerry.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Chad Dillard","Hi, good evening everyone. So can you talk about your commitment to the integrated delivery model and then how this could potentially change and then if, are there any projects that you took charge of that were a bit under that model? And then secondly, with your new risk framework, like how does your prospect list change? What was it before the new framework was implemented, was it look like today?","Carlos Hernandez","Let me answer the second question first. Our prospect list really doesn\u2019t change that much. One of the areas where we expect our prospects to materialize, we mentioned it the earlier remarks, is in mining. For example, where almost all the work is reimbursable and with respect, I mentioned earlier with respect to the next six quarters or so, we have prospects that are about between $12 billion and $13 billion of lump sum work, but two-thirds of that prospect list or the value of the prospects are either negotiated lump sum services or the Mozambique project, which we mentioned earlier passes all of our tests in terms of project pursuits. And remind me what was the first part of your question?","Chad Dillard","Yes. I was just curious about your commitment to the integrated delivery model, how it could change and were there any projects that took charges this quarter bit under that model?","Carlos Hernandez","We have the integrated delivery model is something that we\u2019re going to continue to have \u2013 to have available to us. But to the extent that any of our strategic review results in some changes and how we handle our investments and that might change. But, we are \u2013 that\u2019s a capability that we have, that we\u2019re going continue to offer, but we\u2019re not necessarily going to be limited to that. To the extent that we can offer parts of that delivery model. Because the clients want that, we\u2019re prepared to do that. We\u2019re not going to walk away from different offerings.","Chad Dillard","Got it. And so I\u2019ll take $670 million of charges, let me guess like how much revenue does that represent and how much is still profitable?","Mike Steuert","That represents single digit revenue less than 10%, as we look forward for the company. Amount that\u2019s profitable is a modest amount given where you are in those projects. It\u2019s very modest. There were profitable projects in infrastructure as Carlos mentioned, where we took charges on and there were a couple of other one-off projects that were profitable, we reduced profitability going forward. But it\u2019s those projects, I think Jamie asked the question earlier, they represent a large proportion of our revenue or our backlog.","Chad Dillard","Got you. If I can just squeeze in one last one and just with regard to your analysis of LNG Canada, meeting complicated requirements that probably \u2013 is that predicated on owning are there equity ownership in your fab yard?","Alan Boeckmann","Well, that\u2019s certainly a part of the risking of that project that we have, our modules being built at the fabrication yard in China. So that\u2019s definitely part of it, yes.","Chad Dillard","Thank you.","Operator","And we do have time for one more question. We\u2019ll take our last question from Andy Wittmann with Baird. Please go ahead.","Andy Wittmann","Great. Thanks for taking my question here. I guess, my question is building on some of the cash and balance sheet questions and would probably be appropriate for Mike. Just looking at the contract assets and the contract liabilities that you reported here, your assets are down sequentially and your liabilities are up significantly from the charges that you took. You\u2019re now in a position for the first time where your contract asset or your contract liabilities are actually in excess of your contract assets.","So typically the other way to the tune of about $600 million to $700 million to the positive on assets, so can we \u2013 is there any \u2013 can we use this relationship between contract liabilities and contract assets to forecast what your potential cash burn could be? You suggested that the second half of the year could burn $200 million or $300 million and there\u2019d still be some burn into 2020. I mean, are we looking here at $700 million, $800 million of cash burn as we move into 2020 on these projects that have the negative contract capital position?","Mike Steuert","That\u2019s a little high. The cash burn will be a portion of the losses we took were not all those losses do not represent a cash burn, some \u2013 for cash that\u2019s already been spent. That was unapproved change orders, things like that that we took off our books where we spent the cash but just don\u2019t expect a collection on the revenue side. We didn\u2019t give out specific numbers, but some of the charges related to cost growth. And on the cost growth side, we will probably see cash outflow. On the revenue side where we expect less revenue income, we\u2019ve already spend some cash and we won\u2019t see that it\u2019ll be a portion, it\u2019ll certainly be more than half, but it won\u2019t be the full amount of those charges.","Andy Wittmann","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just in the case of cash burn happening here, would you look to fund that off of your revolver or would you start considering repatriating some of the foreign domiciled cash? And if you did, what would the tax implications of that be, if that\u2019s one of the options that\u2019s on the table?","Mike Steuert","Given the cash that we have on hand domestically and our ability to repatriate foreign cash over time and we have a lot of other actions that I mentioned. We\u2019re going to starting right away selling some excess real estate, we\u2019re going to actually be cashing in some insurance policy, if we\u2019re doing a lot of things to generate cash. I expected everything we can, so we\u2019re not going to be funding any of our cash requirements off the revolver, that\u2019s our last option.","Andy Wittmann","Got it. Okay. That\u2019s all my questions. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Hernandez for any additional or closing remarks.","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you, operator and thanks to all of you for participating on our call today. While we still have a lot of work to do with Fluor that we asked for your patience as we ensure we are taking the right steps. We maintain our conviction that Fluor is a best-in-class company and our remaining diligent in our pursuit to restore our reputation and credibility.","Our priority going forward is to pursue win and profitably deliver on work that is aligned with Fluor\u2019s risk profile, engineering, and project management capability. We look forward to providing additional information on September 24, as it pertains to our strategic review and our process regarding portfolio rationalization. Greatly appreciate your support of Fluor. Thank you.","Operator","Once again, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.

With us today are Alan Boeckmann, Fluor's Executive Chairman, Carlos Hernandez Fluor\u2019s Interim Chief Executive Officer; Bruce Stanski, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer; and Jose Bustamante, Fluor's Executive Vice President of Business Development & Strategy.","Our earnings announcement was released earlier this morning. We have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information.","There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the Company's Form 10-Q filed earlier today and our 10-K filed on February 21.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of historical non-GAAP amounts to the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Alan Boeckmann, Fluor's Executive Chairman. Alan?","Alan Boeckmann","Thank you, Jason. First of all, good morning, everybody, and I thank you for joining us. I'll be brief in my comments, but I'm pleased to have to the opportunity to be actively reengaged with a company that spend such a sole focus of my career.","I started with Fluor in 1974 and I have a great respect and fondness for this company, our employees and the clients we work with around the world. Speaking on behalf of the Board, I also want to thank David Seaton for his decades of contribution and dedication to Fluor.","Now, some of you might not know Carlos, but I had the foresight to recruit him to Fluor when I was CEO to lead our legal team. Over the years, he has expanded his responsibilities and he's been extensively involved in operations. Fluor's board is highly confident in his ability to lead this company, and I look forward to work in hand-in-hand with Carlos and his leadership team","So, with that, let me turn it over to our CEO, Carlos.","Carlos Hernandez","Thanks, Alan. I'm pleased to take this opportunity and look forward to working with all of you. I also want to thank everyone for joining us on such short notice. Given the events that have transpired, we felt it was prudent to move out the earnings call before our earnings meeting this morning \u2013 our shareholders' meeting this morning, rather.","I want to start by addressing the announced charges incurred in the quarter. Needless to say, we are very disappointed with these results.","Please turn to Slide 3. In Energy & Chemicals, results for the quarter include an additional project adjustment of $53 million, relating to an offshore project. After a complete deep dive and re-estimate of project, it was determined that the unique features of the FPSO created the need for our engineering team to redesign certain elements of the project and ultimately repurchase certain components.","The forecast division reflects the redesign required as a result of client input and detailed engineering reviews, and the subsequent impact on material quantities, equipment specifications, and construction schedule. Our client has been extremely supportive and is collaboratively working with the project team as we worked through these challenges. I want to also point out that the client is in the process of providing additional financial support.","In this segment, we also recorded a $31 million charge in connection with the resolution of final close-out matters with the customer. We expect this charge will fully resolve all matters with the customer and no additional expenses will be taken.","In the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, we experienced a $26 million in additional costs related to the punch list items for our legacy gas-fired power business. Lows [ph] out efforts of the plant in Florida have been hampered by ongoing disputes with the client.","Please turn to Slide 5 for a review of our segment and market outlook. Starting with Energy & Chemicals, we're off to a good start on the LNG Canada project. Our team in Kitimat just completed the site preparation and our project management team in Calgary is working on detailed engineering and is engaged with our joint venture partner, JGC, on executing our modularization strategy.","Additionally, we have submitted our FEED proposal to build the next trains, 3 and 4, and anticipate a contract award towards the end of this year. While we are making progress, it's important to know that revenue contributions for this project will be relatively modest until construction starts to ramp-up in 2020.","Before I move away from LNG, we continue to be well positioned for this investment cycle. We have submitted our bid for the Mozambique Rovuma project and the NextDecade Rio Grande LNG project. We expect both clients to reach final investment decisions in the second half of the year.","During the quarter, we successfully completed the Sasol ethane cracker in Louisiana. The Sasol project was the last project completed in the first wave of crackers that started earlier this decade.","Right now, we are positioning for new cracker opportunities, including recent awards to develop certain FEED packages for the upcoming Sunshine Formosa project and the feasibility study for our large petrochemical project for BASF in Asia. New awards were $1 billion for the quarter, as expected. Our major award in the quarter was for the Wanhua Chemical Complex in Louisiana.","Looking forward, in addition to the FID decision on the LNG bids, I just discussed, we also expect to see an award for the South Louisiana methanol project this quarter and an award for the Lake Charles methanol facility later this year.","Turning to Slide 6, in the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment, new awards for the quarter were $1.3 billion and included the Red and Purple Line Modernization project for the Chicago Transit Authority. This award builds off of our experience in light rail, including our current projects in Boston and Maryland and our recent completion of the third and final line for the Denver Commuter Rail Project.","In March, we announced that we broke ground on the Los Angeles International Airport Automated People Mover project. This project is scheduled to be completed in 2023, and will be a great enhancement to the City of Los Angeles ahead of the 2028 Olympic Games. We continue to track additional infrastructure projects, including the I-635 project here in Dallas, and the Oak Hill Parkway project outside of Austin.","In Mining & Metals, we are seeing solid execution for projects that were awarded in 2018. We're working on a number of FEED and feasibility studies that have the potential to translate into over $10 billion of new awards, starting in 2020. Future EPC awards could include copper, bauxite, gold, diamond and lithium.","Turning to Slide 7. Results for the Government segment are in line with the expectations and new awards of $331 million. The quarter-over-quarter comparison of results for this segment is a bit distorted by the significant amount of Puerto Rico power restoration work that contributed to Q1 2018 results.","In April, we were informed by the U.S. Army that we were successful on winning the LOGCAP V award for AFRICOM. We are currently supporting 15 bases for this combatant command and we see the center of gravity shifting to this region. While we are pleased to continue our efforts in AFRICOM, we are disappointed in not being selected as the incumbent for the Afghanistan region. As with any contract of this complexity, this transition will take some extended time. We do not anticipate immaterial change in our execution plan for 2019.","Turning to Slide 8. In Diversified Services, results for the quarter reflect the completion of certain large projects in our AMECO equipment business line. New awards of $810 million include a significant award for maintenance and outage services in our power services business.","I'll now turn the call over to Bruce to give some financial highlights for the quarter. Bruce?","Bruce Stanski","Well, thank you, Carlos. Please turn to Slide 9 in your deck. Revenue for the quarter was $4.2 billion, compared to $4.8 billion a year ago. First quarter revenue reflects lower volume on a few large projects in the Energy & Chemicals and the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power groups, partially driven by the timing of client furnished materials. Our quarterly new awards were $3.4 billion, which means our book-to-bill ratio for the quarter was 0.81.","As Carlos discussed, we expect to see our new awards pickup through the year as some of the major projects we are tracking get booked. Our backlog currently sits at $39.3 billion and it's pretty evenly split between fixed price and reimbursable work.","Corporate G&A expense for the first quarter was $61 million, compared to $57 million a year ago. Expenses for this quarter include $19 million related to foreign exchange losses compared to $12 million a year ago. Excluding the impact of FX, expenses are below our annualized G&A midpoint guidance of $50 million per quarter.","Turning to Slide 10. Our first quarter results was a net loss of $58 million or $0.42 loss per diluted share. Our per share earnings for the first quarter do include charges of $0.65 resulting from forecast revisions on an Energy & Chemicals project, resolution of closeout matters with the customer, and legacy gas-fired power projects.","Also included restructuring charges of $0.15 and corporate and embedded derivative foreign exchange impacts of $0.13. Results for the quarter also reflects favorable project forecast revisions for certain projects in our Energy & Chemicals segment. Our restructuring charges of $27 million in the quarter were related to our Stork\u2019s business. We do anticipate another $23 million in Stork-related restructuring charges this year. Fluor's cash plus marketable securities for the quarter was $1.9 billion, compared to $2 billion last quarter. Our available domestic cash balance represents about 25% of total cash.","I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2019, which is on Slide 11. As a result of our revised business forecast in Energy & Chemicals and Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, the company is issuing adjusted earnings per share guidance of $1.50 to $2 per diluted share. Adjusted EPS guidance excludes costs related to the Stork restructuring plan and foreign exchange fluctuations.","In addition, we anticipate a lower G&A expense range of approximately $160 million to $180 million, down from prior guidance of $190 million to $210 million. NuScale expenses of $40 million and a tax rate of 25% to 30%. We expect our earnings will continue to be weighted toward the back-end or back half of the year. We have good visibility into our backlog and new awards pipeline, and expect to see the impact of that work accelerate our revenue through 2019 and into 2020.","That being said, we have slightly pulled down our revenue and margin projections from our previous forecast as we see some projects move to the right. Our current revenue forecast for 2019 is relatively flat compared to 2018. In 2020, we expect to see good revenue growth as some of our larger projects start to ramp up.","Moving to Slide 12, we anticipate margins for the balance of the year in Energy & Chemicals group to be 5% to 6%; Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power to be just under 2%; Government, excluding NuScale, to be approximately 3%; and Diversified Services to be 4% to 5%.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will hear first from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning. Can you hear me?","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. Good morning, Jamie.","Jamie Cook","Hi, good morning, and welcome. Alan, I never thought I'd have the opportunity to ask you a question again on an earnings call.","Alan Boeckmann","Good to hear your voice, Jamie.","Jamie Cook","Good to talk to you, and welcome, Carlos. I guess my first question understanding this is all relatively new, but have we had the opportunity \u2013 obviously, we had more charges in the quarter. Have we had the opportunity to scrub the entire backlog versus something that's on the come, so while David's announcement is new; Alan, you've been on the Board for, I don't know, month or so, so I'm just wondering how long this has been in the works?","Second, the market is still going to be overly concerned with LNG Canada and the comfort level with that project, just given the fixed price exposure in Canada. So how do we think about that?","And then, I guess, my last question is understanding, this is all new when we think about a long-term CEO. Historically, Fluor has chosen internal candidates, are we \u2013 is this an internal search or internal and external? Just trying to think about how wide of a range the search would be, and what that implies strategically? Thank you.","Alan Boeckmann","Jamie, let me take one part of your question, first, and then I'll let Carlos address the issues of backlog. Actually, for the record, this is my second day on the Board of Directors. The announcement came out a couple of\u2026","Jamie Cook","The announcement\u2026","Alan Boeckmann","Yes. And that was all the proxy, but this was not in my plans when I accepted to come back on the Board. But we are here and I can tell you that we are not doing a search, the Board has given Carlos full authority to go forward in leading this company as CEO and to get in and do the \u2013 and to drive, I would say, some dramatic improvement in risk assessment, bidding processes and project execution.","Carlos Hernandez","Jamie, let me answer the other part of your question about whether we done a full scrub of all of our projects. And let me just say that our focus, our renewed and enhanced focus is going to be on operations. We're going to have our fingers on the projects, we're going to have our thumb on the pulse of every project and that will be a companywide area of focus.","We are \u2013 I've been receiving reports on the offshore project, on some of the gas-fired power projects that are finishing up now for some time. We have dedicated special resources to both of those projects and this morning we will begin to review with the management team all the projects that we have concerns about, which are not very many. You must remember that 97 plus percent of our projects are all performing very well.","We have just a couple of projects that have been challenging for us for a variety of reasons, we're going to \u2013 and the project execution improvement will begins with the project pursuit process. The estimation, the contraction \u2013 the contracting, the staffing and the oversea \u2013 overseeing of those projects and that will be management's primary focus, so that we can deliver more consistent results.","Jamie Cook","And, I'm sorry, just on LNG Canada specifically?","Carlos Hernandez","LNG Canada is getting off to a good start and we have a dedicated management team that sits on the Board of that business, of that significant project and very much involved with everything that's going on there. So we're feeling \u2013 we're showing very good about that project at this point.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thank you. I'll get back in queue. Welcome.","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you, Jamie.","Operator","Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi has the next question.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Good morning, guys.","Carlos Hernandez","Good morning, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Alan, so I think we'd be remiss if we didn't asking for some perspective versus when you run the company. I know it's early for you, but Fluor has gone through many years of evolving into business model toward the integrated solution and data analytics, and it seems like a lot of it hasn't worked well. So maybe you can give us a perspective on what you think has gone wrong? Obviously, there\u2019s \u2013 when you run the company, there's a lot more fixed price exposure, is that it? Is it something else? Any perspective would be helpful.","Alan Boeckmann","Andrew, I think is \u2013 it's early for me to comment on looking into \u2013 this is a root cause. I will be lending support to Carlos and his team. And for the Board perspective, continue to communicate the expectations of the Board. I clearly \u2013 I think everybody is disappointed in the results and the results of this quarter and the continued losses on project, and that's why I spoke to the issue of Carlos and the Board having confidence in him and his team to really get around this and drive some dramatic improvement.","I will, maybe in a future opportunity to call, be able to give some highlights on what I think are some of the differences. But, right now \u2013 there is no doubt in my mind that processes have been improved, the technology has been invested in and we have strong players at each of the leadership positions. So I think it's a matter of just digging into it and put my nose to the grindstone and figure out what the best execution we have is...","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks for that, Alan. Carlos, Can I follow up on Jamie's question around the projects themselves. When do you think we can put the power projects actually behind us? I know, we're in punch list there, so it should be relatively soon. How far long is the offshore project? And are there any other projects, at this point, that have sort of the yellow flags around them?","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. The gas-fired power projects, we will be \u2013 we'll have those projects behind us by early summer. We still have some ongoing issues with our client and those will probably linger for a while, although we are engaged and planned to be engaged in conversations with the client in that regard and, hopefully, we can resolve those in a commercial basis. With respect to the offshore project, I think, last quarter, I believe, we reported that we will close to 50% complete.","The way we have \u2013 we analyze that project, when we look at it in various ways and the percent complete varies in depending on how we look at it. And it's really not as relevant right now, because we've got certain milestones that we have to hit. We're working with our fabricator closely and with the client. So while we've had challenges, I think we're on the path to ride that ship and deliver a project as we usually do to our client that will be productive and make the client very satisfied with our performance.","And I believe you had one other question, what was that? Do we have any other projects? We don't have any other projects. We look at project, as you know, every quarter. We do the scrub every quarter where we are on each project and we report those where we have an issue or not. And those are the only \u2013 that's the only project we had an issue this quarter. Obviously, we had some issues with a couple of legacy projects, but, at this point, we feel pretty good about where we are with our backlog.","Andrew Kaplowitz","And just a quick one for Bruce, I mean, you lowered the guidance by $1, $0.65 of charges in the quarter, is the rest just sort of lower revenue and delays on projects? Is there any contingency in there for execution?","Bruce Stanski","Thanks, Andy. And relative to our guidance, you're right, its $1 lower and if you really kind of do the math, $0.65 was in charges in the first quarter. And we've \u2013 what we've done is, looked at all of our projects as we have seen some lag in our existing project burn and I think that has a lot to do with the revenue recognition making that longer burn, so pushing more of the earnings into 2020 than we originally thought. And so, when we reforecasted that plus some of these new awards that we're chasing that are moving into 2020 that accounts for about $0.35. So that's the dollar that we're taken off guidance, it's as straightforward as that Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Thanks, guys.","Operator","Michael Dudas with Vertical Research has the next question.","Michael Dudas","Good morning, everybody. Welcome back, Alan and welcome, Carlos. I know its difficult day down there outside of Dallas.","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you, Michael. Well, good morning.","Alan Boeckmann","Michael, good day. How you're doing?","Michael Dudas","Alan, good. Alan, just want to clarify your comment earlier to Jamie's question in the press release and indicated that Carlos was named the Interim CEO. Is that correct? And is there going to be a full search or you just want to clarify that comment from the press release what you said in Jamie's question?","Alan Boeckmann","No. Mike, it's a good question. Again, I take the blame for not reading the final draft of that, actually I would have preferred that clause not have been in there. We have not started a search, we're not intending right now to start a search. The title of Interim CEO is what it means, but I think the intent of our \u2013 of the Board is, with David's departure is, we want to vest in Carlos the complete authority to take this team and drive it forward with all the improvement, expectations that we have.","And we do have expectations in that regard. And, again, I've known Carlos and worked with them for quite a long time. And my own acceptance of moving into being the Executive Chair was that \u2013 I'm going to lend every piece of my personal support to that process. But make no mistake about it, Carlos will be running the company. But I think that combination the Board is looking forward to that combination along with the rest of the very strong executive team to drive the improvements that we are expecting and want to achieve.","Michael Dudas","So when you accepted the Board position in March or will be soon announced that you're going to accept for the upcoming year, your expectation coming on after being away was there an inclining your indication of \u2013 you were just seeing from the outside that there were some difficulties you could lend a hand or I just want to get it from the Board's sense. And I know you've only been on the Board officially a day, the evolution of this event occurring today because the significant event and one that comes with a lot of thought, but also some explanation as well.","Alan Boeckmann","No, again, a very good question. When I was asked to come back on the Board, you know my history with this company, this is one company I know is not in my vocabulary, so I suggest to come back on the Board really for the purpose of adding to \u2013 at the Board level knowledge not just to the company but of the whole capital projects business. Also, I have known David Seaton for quite a long time and had a very, very strong relationship with him and still do. And so my intent at that time was to assist David and the Board however I could in helping this company. It was not to be here today talking to you in the position that I'm in.","Michael Dudas","I understand. And I guess this one is \u2013 I'm sorry, go on.","Alan Boeckmann","I\u2019m sorry. Did that answer your question?","Michael Dudas","No, it did, Alan, and I appreciate it. Thank you for your thoughts. I appreciate. Good luck.","Alan Boeckmann","Thanks Mike.","Operator","And Steven Fisher with UBS has the next question.","Steven Fisher","Thanks. Good morning, and welcome back, Alan and welcome, Carlos. Just another question on the guidance. Really it sounds like some of this is pushing projects out to the right. Bruce, I know there was a discussion previously about as we would exit the year that the E&C margins would be, kind of, pushing well through that 6% level, I know you said 5% to 6% for the rest of the year.","So, are we still thinking that, as we exit the year, we should be increasing that margin percentage as the year goes on and is this kind of deferral \u2013 like to what extent is this LNG Canada versus just other projects?","Bruce Stanski","Steve, good question. Yes. So, we've provided updated guidance of 5% to 6% prior when we said about 6% for the Energy & Chemicals segment. We are going to be pushing that upper limit of the range there as we move into the second half of the year and it's driven by not just LNG Canada, that is a big factor as more revenue is burnt through that project at higher margins, but really the portfolio in general that has higher margins built into it on what we did recently at higher margins that are pushing through that on the revenue side.","Last quarter, I kind of guided on the trend on the year too and I just want to make a comment on that. So if you kind of do the adjustments that I had in my prepared remarks for the first quarter and get back to an EPS there, we're still about 50% more earnings in the second half of the year as we are in the first half of the year even with this new guidance. I don't know if that helps, but I thought it of for that.","Steven Fisher","Yeah, it does. But just to clarify on the LNG Canada, is that pushing at all to the right or that's \u2013 that literally on schedule?","Carlos Hernandez","No. LNG is on schedule. So it's just the profile of it and as we said, that's our big job, what would normally be a five-year contract is more like an eight-year burn for us and again heavily impacted by this new revenue recognition standard that elongates that burn and pushes it more to the right.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then, I guess, I'm just kind of follow-up on Andy's question asking Alan for perspective here. I mean, Fluor had Investor Day in November, really all around managing performance better, is this just further confirmation that the EPC business model really just doesn't work and a number of these other companies in the industry that are sort of actively moving away from this model, sort of had more of the right idea and you think there's some more major rethinking that needs you on around corporate strategy here?","Alan Boeckmann","Well, a good question, again. The Company is actually once a year holds a strategy session internally with the Board of Directors that will be coming up in mid-June and we will be looking and asking questions and talking about the current strategy and may be making a few corrections. But I think the actual basic concept is sound. What it really boils down to, in my opinion, is, discipline around the big decision, the analysis and assessment of risk and the mitigation of that risk, and then the contracting strategy, but at the end of the day, once that's all done, it's the execution and the process is around it.","I really strongly believe that this company has that capability and I think I'll be working with Carlos and his team to make sure that we know why it's not working on some projects. And, again, we're talking about, as Carlos said, a couple of projects here and that's really unfortunate. Because they really harm the entire earnings results and our share price, but we need to be successful on the entire backlog.","So, I think, yes, from a strategy standpoint, we'll be looking at some aspects of that, but I honestly don't think we'll be looking at much of a change in strategy, maybe a bit more disciplined and structured in execution.","Steven Fisher","Got it. Thanks a lot.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll now move to a question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal","Thank you very much. Alan, you'd mentioned in your prepared commentary around technology and what you have in place making you feel a little better. And over the last \u2013 since you were last CEO, there have been a lot of new technologies and processes, AI, et cetera, that have come in, do you think this could be a pretty game changing and helping your execution strategy going forward?","Alan Boeckmann","Well, I have no doubt about that. I think it's the implementation of strategies and integrating them into the execution is key. I've just had an opportunity, again, since being here two days, I went through a bit of an orientation in the last couple of weeks with some of the executives and the team, but I'm quite impressed with a number of the improvements and implementation, both about strategies but also in the work processes that make those strategies even more effective. So, I'm optimistic. I think this company is going to start performing and it's going to start delivering solid results.","Carlos Hernandez","Yeah, let me add something to that, Tahira. As you know, we've spoken quite a bit about our AI capabilities in connection with developing predictive models and performance on projects. We are also \u2013 and this has been a developing technology that we've had for some time and we're also using this not just doing the project execution, but in the project bidding and pricing phase, and I think that's going to give us a significant advantage and it's going to give us a greater certainty in terms of our development of our bids.","Tahira Afzal","Got it. Okay. And, Carlos, just building on that, especially given your expertise and background, do you feel you'd like to accelerate the investments there, or do you feel you're sufficiently padded and it is more about implementation at this point?","Carlos Hernandez","I think it's more about implementation. We think we've invested a significant amount over the last five years, and now we're at the point where we're actually seeing the results of that investment and the data that we are deriving from the use of that tool is remarkably accurate, we think. And it's actually confirming a lot of what we do without the technology, but it's going to become standard procedure for most of our projects.","Tahira Afzal","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And now we'll hear from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","Carlos Hernandez","Good morning.","Alan Boeckmann","Good morning.","Chad Dillard","So maybe something like a chicken or the egg question. So the issues on the problem projects, would you say that are more related to pricing the bed or more on the execution side or, in other words, I guess going forward, like, what do you think you're going to be focusing more so on that will get a better result in terms of execution? Then also what are your projects that \u2013 they had issues with FID under the integrated delivery model?","Carlos Hernandez","Well, with respect to \u2013 let me speak to with respect to the offshore project, which we mentioned. That's a project where there have been certain engineering requirements have actually changed along the way and have surprised both the owner and us, and so it's required some reengineering and that's the primary reason for the delays in the extra costs there.","If you look back at some of the power \u2013 gas-fired power projects, that was a little bit different, that was a very competitive market. We probably were more aggressive than we should have been in getting those projects. And so everything had to go absolutely right and some \u2013 couple of those projects, they did not. But I don't think there is a \u2013 there is necessarily an explanation for \u2013 one single explanation for every project.","The execution of the project is obviously a complex process and, I mentioned earlier, all the steps that go into a successful project and we have to be rigorous in our \u2013 the application of our discipline and that's what we're going to be doing.","Chad Dillard","Great. And then just switching to more about the market. Can you just talk about the bidding environment in oil and gas? I mean, has there been any shift in customer willingness to share risk with some new projects that you're bidding right now?","Carlos Hernandez","Well, there is \u2013 I'm going to ask Jose Bustamante, who is Head of our Sales to address that point from his perspective.","Jose Bustamante","When we look at the market, we really look at the different segments and some of the segments in which we participate like LNG is really a limited competition market. So when we look at opportunities, we always feel that we have a better opportunity of negotiating terms and conditions that are balancing some of these contracts.","So many times we are only bidding against any one single contractor or maybe another, a joint venture. So we also have some other segments of the market in which the conditions are different and, therefore, are much tougher terms and conditions, but in some of the larger segments in which we participate, I think, we still have the ability of negotiating the right terms and conditions for us.","Chad Dillard","Thank you very much.","Carlos Hernandez","And that's a very good point. I think one of the things that we have to do is we have to be rational about the amount of risk that a contractor can take versus the amount of risks that a client can take. And sometimes that may have become out of balance a little bit and that's something that we're going to bring back in our relationships with our clients, try to balance that risk appropriately.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Carlos for any closing remarks.","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you. Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for participating on our call today. We greatly appreciate your support to Fluor. Thanks, again.","Operator","And, with that, ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect."],"9112":["Fluor (NYSE:FLR) Q3 2012 Earnings Call November  1, 2012  5:30 PM ET","Executives","Kenneth H.

You can find a discussion of those risk factors in the company's Form 10-K, which was filed on February 22, 2012, and in our 10-Q, which was filed earlier today.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon. And thank you, everyone, for joining us. Today, we'll review our third quarter results and discuss guidance for the balance of this year as well as our initial guidance for '13. But before we start, I know the storm has probably impacted many people on the phone quite a bit. Please note that you're in our thoughts and prayers, and hope for a speedy recovery from what is a really, really terrible storm.","To start, I'd like to start on Slide 3 and start with the third quarter. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the quarter were $145 million or $0.86 per diluted share. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $278 million, which compares to $236 million a year ago. Our earnings results for the quarter were strong compared to last year, but they were impacted by a lower-than-expected award fee on the LOGCAP IV project, a higher-than-anticipated effective tax rate and foreign currency losses based on the U.S. dollar.","Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $7.1 billion, which is an increase of 18% over the $6 billion we reported a year ago. Third quarter new awards were sizable at $6.3 billion. Awards were very broad-based, with $2 billion in Oil & Gas awards, $2 billion in Government, $1.7 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure and $581 million in Power.","Consolidated backlog declined for the quarter to just under $41 billion due mainly to the removal of 2 mining projects, which totaled $2 billion.","Turning to Slide 4, Oil & Gas new awards for the quarter included a propylene production facility for Dow Chemical in Texas and a carbon capture and storage project for Shell in Canada. Following a successful FEED project, Fluor was also awarded a contract for Phase 3 of the Malampaya Deep Water Gas-to-Power project in the Philippines. Ending Oil & Gas backlog is now at $19.2 billion and represents a 31% increase over last year. We see continued strength in that market, as evidenced by a very active front-end FEED project slate that continues to track a number of new prospects across the oil, gas and petrochemical market globally. While we expect the natural gas prices in the U.S. remain attractive for petrochemical and other gas-related programs, the sluggish economy and an uncertain regulatory environment could delay our clients' investments and decision timeline.","The Industrial & Infrastructure segment posted third quarter new awards of $1.7 billion, including approximately $700 million for the I-95\/395 managed toll lanes project in Virginia and a blood fractionation project in Georgia. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $16.2 billion, which is down about -- down from about $19 billion last quarter. This decline was driven by the recent softness in the mining new awards, strong revenue burn on existing projects and the removal of 2 significant projects from backlog, which we spoke of.","As you have all been hearing, a number of mining companies are reducing their capital expenditures as a result of slowing demand for commodities. While the near-term prospect lift -- list is shorter than expected just a few months ago, we continue to view mining in metals as a significant long-term market in which Fluor will maintain its leadership position.","Switching to infrastructure business line, demand for transportation projects remains solid, and a number of bids have been submitted that could have a meaningful impact over the next several quarters. I have just a brief comment with respect to the Greater Gabbard project. Hearings on arbitration of our claims have been completed, and we're awaiting the decision of the arbitrators.","Please turn to Slide 5. Now the Government segment reported new awards, $2 billion, which compared to $1.7 billion last year. Bookings in the quarter included LOGCAP IV task orders, as well as annual funding amounts for our Department of Energy contracts at Savannah River and Portsmouth. Ending backlog for the Government segment rose to $1.6 billion.","As mentioned, the Government group's operating results were significantly impacted by a lower-than-expected award fee score, which resulted in an adjustment of our fee assumption on the LOGCAP IV contract. While the ratings we received from the U.S. Army were still very good, they were below our previous rating and, based on the contract, drove a disproportionate reduction in our award fee.","The Government segment continues to focus on existing programs and expanding its portfolio of services, service-related work. During the quarter, the DOE exercised its option to extend our contract at the Savannah River site for an additional 38 months, which takes our contract through September 2016.","With regard to services work, a Fluor team has been selected by the U.S. Army sustainment command to participate in the U.S. Army's EAGLE Logistics program, which allow -- will allow us to compete for future task orders. Finally, during October, the Department of Defense selected another Fluor JV to perform base operation support at the Rock Island Arsenal in Illinois, as well as 6 other locations in Illinois. This is exactly the kind of growth opportunity that the group has been targeting.","Global Services segment booked $165 million of new awards. We took its ending backlog to $1.8 billion. They're pursuing a number of new long-term contracts with major industrial customers.","Power segment booked $581 million in new awards in the quarter, including an award for the Phase I of 175-megawatt solar photovoltaic energy facility in California. They also received a limited notice to proceed on Dominion Energy's combined-cycle facility in Virginia, full notice to proceed as expected in the third quarter of 2013. Backlog improved to $2.1 billion from $1.1 billion a year ago.","Power segment operating results included the cost associated with ongoing research development investment activities in NuScale. While we had initially expect a decision on the FOA funding before the election, it now appears unlikely. We remain hopeful that the decision will be reached soon.","Before I turn the call over to Biggs, I wanted to cover a few strategic actions that we have recently undertaken. Please turn to Slide 6. As we have discussed, we're keenly interested in expanding our vertically-integrated service offering, which we believe will be a key success factor in executing more construction projects on a direct-hire basis. To this end, we recently formed a joint venture with AG&P in the Philippines, which augments our capabilities in fabrication and modularization. In terms of regional expansion, AMECO, our equipment company, has acquired a company in Mozambique, which expands our footprint in Africa and positions Fluor's overall support opportunities in Oil & Gas segment and other markets in that rapidly growing region.","With that, I'll turn it over for now to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance as well as the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation. With regard to earnings results for the quarter, I want to expand on David's earlier comments regarding unusual items. Late in the quarter, we received our work fee score on the LOGCAP IV contract, which was slightly below our expectations that were established by our previous score. Based on the structure of the contract, a modestly lower score can dramatically affect our share of the available fee pool. So even though the reduction in the score was slight, the resulting impact from the third quarter was approximately $20 million or about $0.08 per share, the majority of which is a catch-up effect recorded in the quarter.","The second item I want to comment on is the impact of foreign exchange, which total just under $8 million in the third quarter or approximately $0.03 per share. Without getting overly granular, while the company has both natural hedges and financial hedging instruments, movement in major currencies during the quarter can have an impact on the income statement.","Moving to Slide 8, Fluor's consolidated backlog was $40.8 billion, which is down from $43 billion last quarter. The percentage of fixed-price contracts and overall backlog was 14% at quarter end, a slight increase from the prior quarter due to the booking of the I-95\/395 road contract. As we expected, the geographic mix of the backlog is starting to shift with US-based backlog now at 25% of the portfolio, which is up from 18% last quarter.","Moving to corporate items on Slide 9. G&A expense for the quarter was $41 million, which is up from $37 million last year, mainly due to the effect of a higher share price on stock-based compensation expenses. The effective tax rate for the quarter was 35%, which was somewhat above our expectations for the quarter. The effective tax rate was impacted by the payment of additional foreign taxes from the settlement on audit and a reassessment of certain tax exposures. For the full year, we continue to expect the tax rate to be in the low 30s.","Shifting to the balance sheet, the consolidated cash and marketable securities balance totaled $2.8 billion at quarter end, which is up about $300 million from the last quarter and even with a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was a strong $429 million during the quarter. This positive result was driven by earnings sources, as well as improvement in project working capital balances.","Capital expenditures for the quarter were $68 million, which compares with $79 million a year ago. Most of our CapEx is directed towards equipment business line in our Global Services segment. Through 9 months, our CapEx is trending below last year.","During the quarter, we repurchased over 600,000 shares for $31 million and paid out $27 million for our quarterly dividend. Shares repurchased for the quarter were lower than planned due to the timing of cash flow receipts versus our window for buying shares. We anticipate this year, repurchases could increase in the fourth quarter as we look to buy shares on an opportunistic basis.","I will conclude my remarks by providing an update on our guidance for 2012 to 2013, which is on Slide 10. We are raising the lower end of our EPS guidance for 2012 to a range of $3.60 to $3.80 per share from the previous range of $3.50 to $3.80 per share. This new range includes a pretax gain of approximately $40 million related to the recently completed sale of our interest in Citylink in the U.K., which will be included in our fourth quarter results.","For 2013, we're establishing our initial EPS guidance at a range of $3.85 to $4.35 per share, reflecting the potential for growth in all business segments except industrial infrastructure, which has experienced a slowing -- experiencing a slowing in new mining and metals awards as commodity demand weakens. It also reflects a level of caution due to the economic and market uncertainties that we are seeing.","Our guidance for 2013 assumes that G&A expense will be in the range of $160 million to $180 million and an effective tax rate of 32% to 35%.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will go first to Andy Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, if you -- you talked about in the release and then the call about the uptake in Oil & Gas and how it may not fully benefit financials until 2014. Are you talking about backlog moving to the right potentially or do we still expect a lot of these, or at least some of these oil & Gas projects to be awarded next year, specifically in the U.S.?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'm cautiously optimistic, Andy. I think -- when I look at where we are with our Oil & Gas business, I think we've made -- we've turned the corner. And I really expect a pretty good ramp-up in project activity, both in terms of backlog and earnings. As I said in the prepared remarks, my question is, and we've been working on lots of projects in the Gulf Coast, that hopefully, as we move into next year, they'll go into the EPC phase of the project, but that assumes that you've got a supportive regulatory environment. So I'm hedging my bet a little bit with regard to that. The economics of the projects look good, our relationships with the customers and moving them from FEED to EPC is very strong. So I feel -- I'm pretty bullish about Oil & Gas from a standpoint of backlog and earnings. But I think the real ramp-up is probably latter half of next year and then, obviously, into '14 and beyond. But I really think we're in a really good place right now, looking at the future.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that makes sense. Let me stick with Oil & Gas. And if I asked you about the margins, I mean you know what I'm going to ask you, like they've ticked down a little bit sequentially. We knew they weren't going to really go up in the second half of the year, but I guess this -- you haven't done this kind of revenue for 3 years, and you've got pretty low margins. So is this just a mix issue again? And why isn't utilization helping at least a little bit here, and how confident are you still in the improvement in '13?","David T. Seaton","Well, it is -- I think it is a mix issue. And the leverage comment that you make is really attributable to when we go into the EPC phases of the projects, even though I would say that some of the FEEDs that we're working are as large of FEEDs that we've ever worked on. So there will be some leveraging as we get into late next year, but that leverage calculation is really kind of a '14 phenomenon. But I'll tell you, I'm pretty bullish right now on our Oil & Gas awards backlog and potential earnings.","Andy Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Biggs, maybe just a clarification on the mining cancellations. Was the majority in the Peru project, or was it kind of half-and-half between Peru and Australia?","Biggs C. Porter","Mostly Peru, probably 2\/3 Peru and 1\/3 Australia.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess my first question is as you look at your 2013 outlook range, at the bottom end, are you building in some incremental cost share on mining projects that are in your backlog? Or is there assumption that those will likely go ahead and the incremental risk is more toward to prospects versus what's in your backlog?","David T. Seaton","I think backlog is solid. I think -- we've been pretty conservative in how we put things in and how we take things out. So I don't think it's a backlog issue. I think it's a softness relative to new awards for the rest -- last 2 months of this year and into next year.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And the second question is in regards to the Tappan Zee Bridge project. I think as you've talk to the DOT recently, it seems that you guys have been singled out as the only team to -- that has -- that is going to negotiate on the project. It's a pretty significant project in many ways. Would you talk about what it means for Fluor in terms of reputation as more of these alternate financing large projects go through and really what it could mean in terms of capacity bottlenecks as we start to see more of these projects ramp up in the U.S.?","David T. Seaton","Well, it wouldn't be appropriate for me to comment on Tappan Zee. I mean, it's an active procurement, and I read the same things you read. I think, from a market perspective overall, though, I think you see the reports on the aging infrastructure in the United States. I think that projects like the San Francisco Bay Bridge, the Denver light rail projects in Virginia, I think we've built up a really good r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that puts us in a leadership position to capture a fair share of that infrastructure rebuild or newbuild. So I think the guys have done a really good job to position for the future, and I think we'll be a major player in these projects going forward.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just got one last question, and I'll hop back in the queue, and that's with NuScale. Clearly, the DOE funding seems to be a little slow in coming out. Any updates over there would be appreciated.","David T. Seaton","To be politically correct, or lack thereof, I think it's held up in the normal bureaucracy that we see relative to the FOA. We're still continuing with our investments in the technology that we believe in for the future. And we're going to invest in a prudent manner based on a schedule that makes sense. And when we had delays in FOAs and things like that, we just continue on and make sure that we're being prudent in the investment that we make.","Operator","And we'll go to George O'Leary of Tudor, Pickering.","George O'Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","First question with the industrial & Infrastructure segment and kind of recent incremental weakness in the mining sector. Has your posture changed at all in terms of infrastructure projects being to offset that potential weakness in the mining segment? Can you talk about that, even if just qualitatively, how you guys are thinking about that segment overall?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think there's still -- I mean, it's not a weak market. I mean, there's still a fair amount of backlog that are continuing to move. I think if you've listened to the Barrick release, there's actually growth on a project where they were taking over some new scope, which is a good news scenario. We've announced a couple of FEEDs on some other projects in Russia and otherwise. So the industry is just, I think, taking a deep breath in the face of the economy that we all see. And in the case of the 2 that we have taken out of backlog, I wouldn't categorize them as being canceled. I'd categorize them as being delayed beyond what we think is prudent to keep it in backlog. So I think, overall, I would comment that even though we're seeing some softness, there's still some bright spots in that market, particularly with the projects we have in backlog. Relative to what fills up what, I mean, I think -- we're very proud of the diverse portfolio that we've got, whereas all-in-all, with ups and downs, we're showing growth, double-digit growth in terms of EPS depending on where you choose to place your number. And that's a testament to the portfolio. We've enjoyed the mining boom. We've taken advantage of that work, and now we're turning the crank on E&C and some other things, Oil & Gas and some other things that, from a portfolio standpoint, keep us in that northerly growth trajectory on the curve. So I think this is just -- the way I look at it is, even with the puts and takes and having an economic headwind, we're showing continued growth year-over-year, and we're pretty pleased with that.","George O'Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's very helpful. And then maybe switching gears a little bit. Are you guys seeing any incremental refining opportunities in the U.S., just kind of given where crack spreads are, we're seeing increasing light oil production specifically from shales in tandem with all the gas that we've seen online. So where do you think...","David T. Seaton","We are seeing some FEED work in our refining segment, which is pretty positive in North America, and I think as well as we look outside the United States. So it's coming back. I think it's -- the projects might be a little bit smaller that we saw in the last wave, but there's still a significant opportunity for us there based on the FEEDs that we're already doing.","Operator","And we'll go to Steven Fisher of UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a clarification on the guidance. Can you just give us a sense of what your assumptions are on buybacks and the level of NuScale investment in the guidance for next year?","Biggs C. Porter","Okay, sure. On share buyback, we didn't assume any, as I said in the comments, to expect that pace to pick up somewhere in the fourth quarter, but we don't layer it into any of the guidance from an EPS standpoint. From a standpoint of NuScale, this year, expect supporting the FOA cost but not getting -- or the FOA activity but without getting an FOA award in, we'll run at a $0.25 to $0.30 effect of our NuScale investment for this year. Next year, we would expect it to be roughly in line after getting the FOA awards, so spending will go up, it'll be offset by additional funding.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then, David, which specific regulatory aspects are you most concerned about on the domestic Oil & Gas project? Is it really just around the extent of gas exports we support versus how much we're going to be using for domestic manufacturing? Is that what needs to be worked out?","David T. Seaton","You really want me to stick my finger in the eye of one of the regulators? No, I mean, all of these projects, particularly in the Gulf Coast, I mean, there's obviously the EPA and those types of permits that typically either don't fit the timescale that we're looking at or delay it for some reason. I don't think it has anything to do with the debate of whether the U.S. should export gas or not. It's all based on the typical project approvals. Most of these projects are in states, obviously Texas, Louisiana and some other places, that are looking at economic development and job growth. So I think there's going to be some sufficient support there and hopefully support as we go towards the federal permits that are required.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So it's really just a permitting type issue?","David T. Seaton","Right.","Operator","And we'll take a question from John Ellison of BB&T Capital Markets.","John D.  Ellison - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Would you guys be able to discuss the deep water opportunities you're seeing in Fluor's role of an -- on an EPC basis? And if you're bidding on this work as part of the JV or consortium, does it result in lower effective margins?","David T. Seaton","No, I wouldn't say it would actually lower margin on a JV basis. We've chosen to work with others on deep water and offshore programs, and we're going to continue to do that. I think we're going to be able to compete not only with the offshore pieces of it but the components that make that up when I mention modular construction and fabrication. And that's where we're going to play a big role in that marketplace.","John D.  Ellison - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Right. And also, has there been any change in the amount of, I guess, fixed price versus cost reimbursable work that you're currently bidding on?","David T. Seaton","It's kind of a mixed bag. I think we're seeing a little bit of an uptick in fixed price work. Obviously, most of infrastructure programs are fixed price. Power is typically fixed price. And we are seeing, modestly so, some interest from the Oil & Gas guys relative to lump sum. But again, it's not going to move the needle that much in the grand scheme of things.","John D.  Ellison - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Right. And just one follow-up real quick. Are you seeing any end markets where capacity is tightening, or where you're -- you've been trying to push for higher prices?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we're trying to make as much money as we can without damaging the relationships with our customers. We haven't necessarily seen any pressure to move up. We think we get what we deserve based on our calculations. And -- but I do believe that margins are improving.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Michael Dudas of Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","David, when do you think the crank is going to get picked up on the power market?","David T. Seaton","Well, we're working on several front ends on gas. I think we're still waiting on the regulatory side, the emission side relative to the coal fleet. We've got several projects that are pending. On natural gas, we're seeing a significant activity, but I think that's predicated on need. We are seeing the reserve margins drop to where they typically will pull the trigger. But I think the big question mark is what do the generators have to do relative to whatever the environmental regs say on the existing fleet, and then what impact does that have on new-generating capacity what fuel source would be. I think that as we get into the back half of next year, we're certainly hopeful and are planning on a fair amount of uptick in our power market. But I think really a resurgence is probably into '14 before we see anything significant.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that. My follow-up question, David, is as you -- as we look to maybe pushing things out '13 into '14, especially with Philippine and North America, do you anticipate a pretty strong, tight construction services market, or an EPC market in the, let's say, second half '13 through '15, '16 time period, given what you're seeing on the drawing board and what regulatory and other political issues come together to allow it to occur?","David T. Seaton","That's a great question. I think -- I'd look at it holistically and would suggest that there's been a lack of confidence over the last probably 2 years relative to a lot of capital spend. That is now starting to create a backup or a huge slug of work coming at us. I think we're seeing some of the supplier network tightening, but it's tightening because of lack of performance on some of the projects that were taken in the last year. So some of that supply network is challenged. It may not, frankly, be around for us when we start this boom again. So I think in general, that slug of work has been pushed to the right, and on the scale, that just means there's going to be more of it. So I think, as we get into -- into late '13, early '14, you're going to see some tightening there. With regard to labor, that's always been a challenge, and I think it's going to be an acute problem in the Gulf Coast. We've done a lot to invest in the people that we're going to need, both in terms of the engineering and project management types of folks. But we're spending a lot of time and effort in building that craft capability again in the Gulf Coast because we're looking at direct hire on most of these projects.","Operator","And we'll go now to Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just a quick question. So on the guidance, if you exclude the gain you're expecting in the fourth quarter, it looks like the fourth quarter earnings is a little bit lower than the Q3, it's probably actually the lowest of the year. Is there anything to read into that as we kind of use that as a springboard into 2013? Is the -- are the pace of things kind of slowing down a little bit before they pick up again? Can you just comment on that?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think that the 2 big moving parts going into the fourth quarter are, I'd just say that the gain on the CityLink sale, for the full year, we have the impact of the LOGCAP fee adjustment that we recorded this year. It adds a little bit more in the fourth quarter, about another $5 million of effect in the fourth quarter. But the other drivers in the fourth quarter are the normal ramp-up in overheads that we see. There's really nothing else that I would say approaches something that creates a different kind of run rate going into next year. We should get back to the normal cyclical nature of things and have strong quarters going into first quarter of next year.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes. And just on buyback, Biggs, maybe this is for you again. So you were light in -- as far as buyback allocation in Q3, where you're saying things will pick up in Q4 likely. But you had a fairly, I guess, depressed stock price during the quarter. I'm just curious what the mindset was, why you were not more aggressive and why you tend to be more aggressive from here on out?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, if I could do it all over again and go back, we probably would have purchased more in the third quarter. But as we -- we track it against cash flow. We've been pretty consistent in saying that we spend cash as it becomes available and that there is no greater use for it internally. And as we were moving through the quarter, cash wasn't generated at the rate it was later on, and then we were pass the window period at which we could operate. So we just weren't able to get that much done in the quarter based upon the timing of cash flow and the visibility that we had. But we ended the quarter strong. We have plenty of cash on the balance sheet. We absolutely know that going into this open window period, so we expect this point in time to be more active.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Yes, and if I could just sneak one more in, maybe for David. Just on -- in the Middle East, we're seeing some projects, it looks like they're starting to get off the ground, particularly in Kuwait. I'm just curious what the opportunities that you see in that region, specifically, primarily on the Oil & Gas side over the next, say, 6 to 12 months.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think that's a region that has pushed some projects out in several countries there that we were active, and we're tracking pretty closely with a lot of them. The -- Kuwait specifically, you probably read the same things I did relative to their parliament being dissolved and the toils and tribulations that go with that. They seem to still be on track for the fourth refinery, as well as the clean fuels programs at the 2 refineries. And we are looking at a couple of the packages on an EPC basis. Saudi continues to be a great place for us. The UAE, I'm very bullish about the UAE, Qatar in terms of Oil & Gas and Infrastructure. So I -- the Middle East is pretty special to me, and I keep close tabs on it. And it'll always be a growth engine for us.","Operator","And over to Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Andrew Buscaglia","Actually, this is Andrew Buscaglia on behalf of Jamie Cook. So on -- quick question on competition. I know you guys mentioned pricing environment a little bit. But can you tell me more on where you're seeing competitively, specifically I think you guys noted Asian competition potentially having some issues, but what are your thoughts there?","David T. Seaton","Well, I mean, competition is always fierce. It don't matter whether it's a buyer's or seller's market: It's always fierce. And we like to believe that it's the value proposition that we give that separates us. And I think that, that generates better margins. I think that from a competition standpoint, I mean, I didn't really mention the Asians, you did, But I'll take your lead there. A lot of them are very full with projects we're glad to have. But on the other hand, there's Asian contractors that we're partnering with that I think give us an advantage in the marketplace, and we're very keen on those partnerships. But I think, like I said, this is a very competitive marketplace, and we tend to beat one another up quite a bit. But I don't see any reason why in the near-term, more because of the way we're doing our business and the value proposition that we give, that we shouldn't improve our margins over time, particularly in Oil & Gas.","Andrew Buscaglia","Okay, that's helpful. And then just my next question, I know you guys -- there's a lot of discussion on mining. But is there -- and specifically with cancellations, but going -- looking into '13, is there still potential for any other large projects that you think -- that you're nervous about getting canceled, or just your thoughts there in terms of sort of what's embedded in your mining outlook.","David T. Seaton","Not particularly worried about cancellations. I think future awards, obviously, could be a problem. But this is kind of interesting, I mean, it's always been when the commodity prices drop is when some of these programs get delayed or canceled. We've seen iron ore drop, obviously, and it's very well-known that Outer Harbour Port Hedland project is postponed indefinitely, but I do not think canceled. But when you think about gold and you think about copper, 2 commodities that we do a lot of work in, those commodities haven't appreciably dropped to the levels where you see cancelations. So as I said, I think we're kind of seeing the mining companies take a deep breath. But clearly, as we come out of this economic mire, those commodities are going to be required for economic growth, and they're going to have to turn the crank back on once those signals are there and seen as solid signals.","Operator","And now to Alex Rygiel of FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","David, can you expand a little bit more upon exactly why the LOGCAP IV fee was a little bit lower than expected? And what is included in your guidance for the next 12 months?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think Biggs talked about it. And, Biggs, help me here if you feel required. We -- basically, at the end of the quarter, the award fee board convened and gave us our award score, which gave us a lower-than-expected score, and that relates into a pretty dramatic declining scale in fee available to us. So the charge -- or not the charge, the adjustment that we made is for previous quarters plus this quarter. So as Biggs said, you can't take that amount and multiply it times $0.25 and get to a run rate. And I don't think I'd want to get into what we've put into -- into individual projects relative to the overall portfolio. But clearly, we're less optimistic than we were because we had to adjust as we pulled together the guidance for '13. Biggs, I don't know if you want to add anything else?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, maybe to put the -- to put it in perspective a little bit. It was about a 7% decline in our score resulting in about a 40% decline in the amount of fee pool that was available. So the slope of funding at the pool is pretty severe for just small changes, in the score and in the territory which we're operating in. So it really wasn't a bad score, just a slight change to it, and but has a big effect on the funding of the pool. The -- for the rest of this year, we're not projecting any change. We don't receive another score, don't expect one between now and the end of the year. So don't expect any change, to be pretty clear on that, with respect to this year's outlook. Obviously, our objective is to do better next year. But as David said, it doesn't make sense to put a lot of line item guidance project by project out there.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Is there anything that's structurally changed with regards to that contract as it relates to services or complexity of the environment that might have indefinitely kind of lowered the profitability of that opportunity?","David T. Seaton","No, none whatsoever.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andrew Wittmann, Robert W. Baird & Co.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","David, just kind of more broadly on Federal, just a step back here. Obviously, LOGCAP has been a really big significant portion of your federal business. But you mentioned a couple of wins in your script that we saw. Can you just talk about what else you're kind of looking at today, and what your overall outlook for Federal could be as we head into next year? I know you said top line up, but is there margin opportunity there as well? I mean, just give us some color as we head into the election next week, actually.","David T. Seaton","I don't even want to go there. Oh, the election next week, I do want to go to so -- I've already voted, and I hope all of you have. I think with regard to LOGCAP, we don't anticipate any change in the current LOGCAP contract for next year. With troop withdrawal in '14, we'll probably see a little bit of an uptick before we see a decline. In the meantime, we're focused on the services area in boss -- what we call -- they call boss contracts or base operating support contracts. As I said, we won Rock Island, we won Jacksonville in the previous quarter. We're pursuing several of those. In addition, there's a couple of procurements right now ongoing in the DOE, and we feel like we're in pretty good position to pick up some of those. So I think all-in-all, the government market is a good, solid business for us. But clearly, I mean, after '14, without LOGCAP, it's a little bit hard to predict. But it's a solid base business, and we get a good return on our investment there.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then just 2 quick ones for Biggs. Tax rate, up next year. Is that just doing more work domestically, or is there something more fundamental that's leading into the increased tax rate expectation?","Biggs C. Porter","No, I don't think that there's any messaging in there. We gave a range. I think the range is still -- it overlaps what we have for this year. I think that -- we'd like to drive it down. We have some strategies to try to drive down, but we're not going to go and count on that at this point in the guidance.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And then just on the FX, the $0.03. Is that $0.03 versus your prior expectations? Is that $0.03 year-over-year? I'm just trying to understand how this callout of FX is maybe different from maybe in terms of impact.","David T. Seaton","Sure. Well, basically, there was no hit from FX to the first 2 quarters of the year. It was pretty much a wash. So this quarter stands out over the course of this year in that there was this hit. And really, it's occasionally driven by the devaluation of the dollar that occurred over the quarter, which was pretty sharp. June 30 was relatively a high point for it, and then it fell over the quarter and had a negative effect on the extent that we're holding dollars around the world. So I think this was an unusual event. I certainly don't want it to recur. I don't think there's any reason why it should.","Operator","And next to Will Gabrielski of Lazard Capital Markets.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So just in terms of '14 -- or excuse me, '13 guidance, you guys are going to accrue next year at the current score you got under LOGCAP rate, and that's embedded in the guidance?","David T. Seaton","As we said, we really didn't want to get into individual projects and what makes up our guidance. So I really wouldn't want to comment on that.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, I understand that. Can you provide the score you received versus what you were accruing at?","David T. Seaton","I'd prefer not to do that, either.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","No problem.","David T. Seaton","I wish I could be more accommodating.","Biggs C. Porter","To be clear, it was -- really, it's a very small change in the raw score, so it doesn't help you a lot anyway. It's just a very small change, but it has a big effect.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","No, I understand that. I think just all of us from covering KBR for years and watching the way the LOGCAP score can impact the accruals and then the true-up you get when you get a new score. I was just wondering if your guidance next year assumes an improvement, and you would be accruing at a higher rate or not.","David T. Seaton","I'd rather not say.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Fair enough. On the Oil & Gas market, the 3 4 [ph], I'm just wondering, is -- the bookings you saw in Q3, is there a better mix in that downstream-oriented work where there's more engineering hours involved maybe than we've seen on the work you've booked over the last 2 or 3 years, including last quarter, which had a lot of big dollars associated with it but not necessarily a lot of dollars where you're earning a margin on it? Is that kind of the issue?","David T. Seaton","Well, as we've said in the past, it's really about margin dollars, not margin percentage. But just from a color standpoint, we've got a couple of programs in there that has significant CFM, the project, one of the projects in Canada specifically, where we're burning at a higher rate today than we have been. And I think the projects that were coming in the backlog are more EPC-type projects with not the same impact on CFM.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. On NuScale, I think you said $0.25 to $0.30 was the impact now in 2012, is that correct?","Biggs C. Porter","Yes.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","So that's a little bit higher maybe than I saw a quarter ago. And I was just wondering, a, what's driving that? And then, b, if you were to be successful in the FOA, what would be the strategy with NuScale after that? Would you look to monetize it? Would you look to partner with somebody from manufacturing? Would there be something else involved beyond just getting the R&D grant from the government and then moving forward and progressing on a stand-alone basis?","Biggs C. Porter","On the first question, it is a little higher. It's been driven by the need to support an FOA schedule and FOA activity. But unfortunately, without the benefit of having the award benefit this year. So even if the award occurs here in the next few weeks, it wouldn't be definitized, and therefore, it wouldn't create a flow of funds and then offset the expense line until next year. So it's a combination of those things, which cause the number to be a little bit higher. We certainly kept that in mind in terms of managing the spend, but it has driven it up a little bit. In terms of strategy, I don't know, David...","David T. Seaton","In terms of strategy, I mean, we're continuing to have dialogue with manufacturers and other potential investors. I think what's happened with the delay of the FOA is some of those folks were saying, Well, why don't we just wait and see what happens. The FOA, at least in terms of what we were told, should have been awarded in August, and then September, and then October. And now here we are on November 1. So I think it's stuck in a do loop somewhere in Washington, but it doesn't change our opinion of the technology or its application, nor does it, I think, lessen the interest in NuScale from outside parties that we would expect to bring in as partners.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay, fair enough. And then lastly, you mentioned U.S. refining as a market where you're seeing some activity. And I'm just wondering, for background, what -- there was a big refinery upgrade cycle so we could go ahead and process Canadian crude as heavy crude, and now we're looking at light crude coming out of the shale formations, which was brought up earlier. So what would be the types of project entail, maybe in terms of scope or dollars, or what would you be looking at to maybe retrofit those refineries to be more efficient at processing light crude out of the shale?","David T. Seaton","Well, I mean, I think they're ready for a crude mix including heavy crudes. The project specifically that upgraded to give them that balance are the ones that put in the cokers to be able to deal with that heavier crude. But I don't think it necessarily changed their ability to refine the lights. I think you're seeing a rationalization of the market and where those product slates are. So you're going to see process units that help them get to a specialty market. You're going to see some capacity increases when it comes to diesel, which really hasn't -- we really haven't done a lot of work on. And I think you're going to see some fair amount of compliance projects that not only improve the environmental outputs but also incrementally improve capacities.","Operator","And we'll go to John Rogers, D.A. Davidson.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","David, I just want to go back to one of your comments about forward or backward integrating, I guess, in terms of the -- or vertically integrated, I guess, was your term. How far away are you from making a major acquisition or investment in there?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think the beauty is, is we've always had that capability, and it doesn't take a massive investment for us to have that capability. That's part of the strength and breadth of the company to begin with. So incrementally, things like AG&P in the Philippines is a very nominal, immaterial amount from an investment standpoint that projects our capability greatly in that fabricated module market. There are others that we're looking at that I would not like to mention, but we're actively looking at improving that skill set. From a construction standpoint, it's taking advantage of the skills and capabilities of our superintendent network that we enjoy now and, frankly, giving them more surety and long-term employment, which we are an employer of choice in that market and it allows us to provide that stability. So I think there's a fair amount of training that's going to have to take place for that next generation of construction worker. And again, that's something that's within our skill set and something we've done quite successfully over the history of our company.","John Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay, okay. And separately, just on the I&I business, the margins that you saw in the current quarter, and this may be in the Q, but were there some closeouts or anything that elevated those margins? Because I just assumed with the mining mix that those continue to drift lower and then reverse as that changes maybe next year.","David T. Seaton","Yes, we had -- the financial close on I-95 project gave us a little bit of an uplift there, and their general projects performed well, so it was a good quarter for them.","Operator","And we'll take a question from Robert Connors of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I was just looking at, that despite the EPS, it looks like the operating cash flow was pretty strong in the quarter. Just wondering what drove that. Was it advance billings or collections of some receivables out there?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, I think you're right. Cash flow was good for the quarter from operations. It was driven by earnings, but as noted, improvement in working capital. It had gone the other way for the first 2 quarters, so it was very satisfying to see it improve here in the third. And it kind of goes back to my comment earlier about conservatism going in the quarter about use of cash. It obviously turned during the course of the quarter and we did have the good cash production that we, of course, wanted. From the standpoint of individual drivers, I think it's more the absence of some of the ones which had held it back in the first 2 quarters. We commented previously on last quarter call that we had a big advance that we were burning off, and that had been a use of cash. And we had some projects that we'd been winding down that were using cash. And so we'll clear a runway in the fourth quarter on those, and had a good performance overall.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just regarding the corporate G&A. It seems for 2013, it looks like it's going to be relatively flat year-over-year. Is that a factor of some cost-reduction initiatives as maybe I&I scales down, or is it more so going to be tied to the top line?","David T. Seaton","No, I think we've been very active in controlling our costs, and I think we've done a really good job of making sure that people are spending overhead dollars like it's their own money. So I think we've seen good behavioral change in the organization that I think is sustainable, which helps us longer term.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And then, David, if I could sort of ask the Oil & Gas backlog question I guess in a little bit of a different way though, more qualitatively, is that if you were to look at not necessarily the dollars but really the man-hours and backlog as you go into 2013, can you just, I guess, qualitatively sort of describe, is it materially up versus where you were at this point about to enter 2012 as far as man-hours?","David T. Seaton","I think it will be materially up if you take January '13 versus January '12. We're really starting to build some power there, and then the EPC phases will follow.","Operator","At this time, I will turn things back over to Mr. Seaton for any closing or additional remarks.","David T. Seaton","Thank you, operator. And I really appreciate everyone participating on the call this afternoon. To kind of follow on to some of the last questions, I want to reiterate a couple of points that we've made today. Number one, we're on track for 2012, and we expect to perform towards the higher end of our original guidance range for the year. And we continue to track a robust list of opportunities in oil and gas and petrochemicals as well as infrastructure. However, we think it appropriate to use a little bit of caution in establishing our guidance for '13 because of the continued weak global economy and the deferral of some of the major mining programs. From a midpoint of our guidance for this year to a midpoint of our guidance for '13, we're projecting a growth in double digits, 10%, which I think seems very reasonable in this environment.","With that, we greatly appreciate your interest in Fluor, and we hope you have a great day. Thank you.","Operator","Once again, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference. Thank you all for your participation."],"9445":["Fluor Corp.

Please go ahead, Mr. Telfer.","Geoff Telfer - Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations","Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Fluor's fourth quarter 2015 conference call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after market close, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference while making prepared remarks.","But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on slide two. During today's call and slide presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-K, which was filed earlier today.","During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now, I'll turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Geoff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call, we'll review our fourth quarter and full year of 2015 as well as discuss our outlook for 2016.","Before we talk about our fourth quarter and full-year results, I do want to spend a few minutes and to share my perspective on the markets we serve. Global economic growth continues to be weak and commodities prices remain low. We expect economic growth of the year to be similar of the past few years. Yet we also expect commodity prices to stabilize during this year and perhaps even begin to improve in the last part of the year. The lower commodity prices obviously continue to impact our customers' cash flows and, therefore, their ability on fund certain new projects at the same pace as they've done previously. Many of our customers have already announced significant reductions in their capital expenditure budget of 2016.","However, Fluor serves a diverse portfolio of industries and regions, which provides the company opportunities even in difficult market environments. While low oil prices may delay some Oil & Gas projects, Flour is focused on our clients and their spending priorities.","As I mentioned in the past, we continue to see the FID and large greenfield LNG facilities to move to the right as clients focused on opportunities to improve capital efficiency. By that extension, it is important to note that we do not anticipate any material contributions from LNG projects during 2016. Our Power business should experience strong growth this year with the Westinghouse projects now fully transitioned, plus the business has experienced an uptick in gas-related projects. Our Government and Infrastructure markets are also experiencing growth with key recent wins including the $1.4 billion nuclear cleanup project in Idaho and the Arizona Loop 202 project. We also expect to hear shortly the outcome of our bid to build the 16-mile purple line, light rail project in Maryland.","We continue to implement our integrated solutions strategy. Our strategy focuses on delivering the full spectrum of capital-efficient solutions for our customers. We've taken significant steps in 2015 to broaden our offering including expanding our global fabrication footprint with the announcement of the COOEC joint venture in China and extending our position in the construction and maintenance markets through the Westinghouse nuclear awards and our upcoming acquisition, Stork.","While we're talking about fabrication investments and historic acquisition, let me give you an update on closing status. Our JV with COOEC and the Zhuhai Fabrication Yard continues to progress. We're receiving final approvals now and expect to make our first payment in the next few months. Back in December, we announced the intent to our acquire Stork, a maintenance and modification and asset integrity company based in the Netherlands. Stork enhances not only our current offering but creates tremendous opportunity to leverage our combined capabilities and brands across a broad spectrum of opportunities. We anticipate this transaction to also close in the next few months. While we expect 2016 to be another challenging year, our focus will be on the things that we can control.","Now let's look at our 2015 full-year results beginning with slide five \u2013 slide three. Excluding a pre-tax non-operating pension settlement expense of $240 million, net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were $571 million or $3.89 per diluted share compared with $715 million or $4.48 per diluted share a year ago. Consolidated segment profit for 2015 was $1 billion, which compares to $1.3 billion a year ago. Despite volatile oil prices, our Oil & Gas segment performed very well during the year, contributing $764 million in segment profit, a 14% increase over 2014. However, this increase was offset by the decline in other segments. Segment profits \u2013 profit margins were 5.7%, which compares with 5.9% a year ago.","Consolidated 2015 revenue was $18.1 billion, down from $21.5 billion a year ago. Full-year new awards were $21.8 billion, including $11 billion in Oil & Gas, $6 million in Power, $3.2 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure, and $1.4 million in Government. Consolidated backlog for the year-ended \u2013 ending was $44.7 billion, up 5% from $42.5 billion a year ago. Our clients have not given any indication that they intend to cancel any ongoing projects with us.","Turning to slide four, the Oil & Gas segment booked $2.1 billion in new awards including two Pemex refining projects in Mexico. Ending backlog for that segment was $28.8 billion, which compares $28.5 billion in 2014. Fourth quarter new awards in Industrial & Infrastructure were $302 million. We closed the year with a backlog of $5.6 billion compared to $7.2 billion at the end of 2014, which reflects the reduced mining and metals new award activity. The Government group posted fourth quarter new awards of $352 million and their ending backlog in 2015 was $3.6 billion.","Turning to slide five, in the Power segment, fourth quarter new awards of $5.1 billion, including award for two reimbursable contracts with Westinghouse Electric Company to manage the construction workforce at two nuclear power plants in Georgia and South Carolina, ending backlog in 2015 was $6.8 billion, which compares to $2.1 billion a year ago.","Segment profit for the fourth quarter was impacted by $31 million charge related to a gas-fired power facility in Brunswick County, Virginia. This was primarily related to commissioning, taking longer than it's expected due to changes and challenges associated with the installation of the gas turbines that extended past in the third quarter. This project has reached mechanical completion. We anticipate turning this project over to the customer in the spring.","With that, now I'll turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, David and good afternoon everyone. Please turn to slide six of the presentation. I'll start by providing some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance, then move to the balance sheet.","Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, which compares to $5.5 billion a year ago. All segments reported slight year-over-year revenue reductions with the exception of Industrial & Infrastructure, which experienced a 41% decline mainly due to the continued reduction in mining activity. Excluding the pension settlement expense of $231 million or $1.04 per diluted share in a quarter, EPS from continuing operations for the fourth quarter was $0.68 compared to $1.41 a year ago. Including pension settlement expenses, the company reported a loss of $51 million or $0.36 per diluted share.","This quarter's EPS was negatively impacted by approximately $0.21 per share due to the combined effect of the $31 million charge on the Brunswick power project and a higher than expected tax rate due to losses in two foreign subsidiaries that we weren't able to benefit for U.S. tax purposes. These tax effects can reverse the future.","Over the course of the year, we've received a few questions about the impact of foreign exchange rates on the P&L. Looking at the impact of FX on a quarterly basis, there is very little variation. However, when you look at FX from a yearly impact, 2015 versus 2014, using average rates of both periods, there is a negative impact EPS of approximately $0.20. Corporate G&A expense for the fourth quarter was $54 million compared to $53 million a year ago.","Shifting to the balance sheet, Fluor's financial position remains very strong with cash plus current and non-current marketable securities totaling $2.4 billion, flat with a year ago. In 2015, the company generated $849 million in cash flow from operating activities compared to $643 million in 2014. The company also returned $635 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. In the first quarter of 2015, as you recall, we also settled the claim from discontinued operations of $306 million. Absent that, cash flow from operations would be even stronger.","The previously announced $1 billion share repurchase program was completed in the fourth quarter of 2014 to the end of 2015. For the year, we repurchased 10,105,000 shares. On February 4, 2016, the board of directors increased our outstanding share repurchase authorization by 10 million shares. However, although our cash position is strong at the year-end, everyone should keep in mind that we have existing near-term commitments for our cash.","Moving to slide seven, Fluor's consolidated backlog at year-end was $44.7 billion. The percentage of fixed-price contracts in our overall backlog was 22% at quarter end, and the mix by geography was 41% U.S. and 59% non-U.S. For the year, backlog was negatively impacted by about $3 billion as a result of the strong dollar.","I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2016, which is on slide eight. We're maintaining our guidance for 2016 at $3.50 to $4 per share. Our guidance for 2016 also assumes G&A expense in the range of $190 million to $200 million at a tax rate of 33% to 35%. Other expectations for 2016 include new scale expenses of approximately $90 million as we get to DCA submittal later this year, capital expenditures of approximately $300 million, and our payments to fund our joint venture with COOEC of $350 million in the first half and $140 million in the third quarter of this year.","Our guidance does not include any benefit related to our acquisition of Stork nor any transaction and integration-related costs. This transaction is expected to close as early as March. Our guidance reflects an expectation of gradual quarterly improvement in 2016.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","The first question come from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citigroup.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good evening, guys.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good evening.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Good afternoon, Andrew.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","How you doing? David, so look, we know new awards are lumpy but just trying to think about how to think about them going forward. So ex the nuclear projects, you booked close to $3 billion of work with most of that Oil & Gas. Maybe you can talk about what you think right now is sort of the underpinnings of work in a more difficult environment. Should this be the minimum that you generally have in any quarter, like a $3 billion number, again ex nuclear? Was 4Q anomalously low and could you average higher in 2016? Just how do we think about it going forward?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I mean that's a great question. I think it's going to be even more lumpy in 2016 than we've seen in the past. The \u2013 what we're going to see is that many of the customers are still taking an extra quarter or so to make their decisions. So we run the risk of having a project go from first quarter to the second quarter or second quarter to the third quarter. So I think it's going to be somewhat more lumpy and I believe backend loaded more so this year than in previous years.","We still have a \u2013 I mean it's a robust plan that's synonymous with the former year in terms of the things we're looking at. So I feel good about the total number, but it's just going to be a little bit of a dance here at the end of the quarter based on what decisions our customers make. We are getting indications that many of these customers are moving forward to FID on some of these programs and projects. So it gives us confidence that we'll be able to book these things. But giving a lot of clarity right now, in terms of what quarter they'll come in, I really can't provide that right now.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay, that's helpful, David. So, look, you ended up recording 7.6% margin in Oil & Gas, it's obviously an impressive result. You've talked about 2016 a little before \u2013 I think you guys have talked about low 6% Oil & Gas margins where we can end up in 2016. If Oil & Gas stays weaker for longer, can you sustain that kind of margin, and how much more cost out opportunity do you have in Oil & Gas? Like how do we get a read on these very high margins in a modestly weaker environment for you guys?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll answer it this way. I think our teams have done an outstanding job in terms of what they brought in the backlog, and the quality of earnings in backlog has not taken a hit, a significant hit. We've really \u2013 I'm really pleased with the way the organization has responded, really pleased with the way the market and, in particular, our customers responded to this integrated solutions model, which gives us confidence that, number one, that strategy is working and is welcomed by our customers and two, is producing the kind of margins that we expect to get. So I feel pretty good about the quality of earnings that are in our backlog.","Now that does not mean there hasn't been pricing pressures in certain markets and doesn't mean there won't be pricing pressures going forward. But I think maintaining that kind of a level during 2016 is quite doable.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","So, David, is it possible to do better than low 6%s if things go right for you in 2016?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's \u2013 I'd rather not get into any more color on the margins than I've ever done. So I think I'll just stick with my 6%s for you.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","In the end, of course, Andy, a lot of that depends upon mix, so it's hard to get more precise.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Mix and timing.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","All right. I'll let you Jamie push you on that guys. Thanks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good try.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes.","Operator","And our next question will come from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Go ahead, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I'm not...","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Go ahead and give me the question.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I'm not even going to go \u2013 I'm not even going to start on Power. I'll let someone else to do that. But anyway, I guess my first question relates to the guidance for 2016. I guess I was a bit surprised that you maintained your guide given you don't assume any contribution from Stork which I get because it hasn't closed yet. But just based on your commentary that customers are slowing spend over a longer period of time, you knew that you had Westinghouse, when you initially gave you guide in the third quarter, doesn't seem like tax rate has changed. So I'm just trying to get a sense have the puts and takes of the guidance changed relative to \u2013 even we're still at the same place relative to where were last quarter?","And then David, I guess my question to you is, Andy's trying to ask about Oil & Gas revenue and operating profit for 2016 or margins, but I guess my concern is or what I'm trying to understand is how do I think about the run rate of Oil & Gas profits as we exit the year. Because my concern I guess is more as we think about 2017, if awards don't materialize this year in Oil & Gas, which I don't think they do, how do I think about or how materially down earnings can be in 2017 because I can't think of a good reason why, outside of what we know about Westinghouse and Stork out, why the other businesses could actually sort of make up for the decline that we're going to see in Oil & Gas.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know, Jamie, it's kind of interesting. I don't really want to talk about 2017 yet. I want to make sure we deliver on 2016. But our diversity does provide those puts and takes that you mentioned. And yes, there have been puts and takes that keeps us at the guidance where we are, which is a value of the diversity that we enjoy. If we were just an Oil & Gas company, you'd probably seen us reduce things like a lot of other folks have over the last few quarters. But that diversity pays off. The ability to take on big projects and power helps that earnings stream, our ability to do operations and maintenance work, our ability to work in the pharmaceutical business, in the infrastructure sector, all helps us from a diversity standpoint maintain earnings power.","So I think that we've got the opportunity to perform as we suggested at the end of the third quarter. Relative to Oil & Gas, right now as we see it, the year will be reasonably strong. And as we enter 2017, assuming that a couple of things happen that we anticipate, 2017 should be equally strong in terms of Oil & Gas. So I guess there's a bit of a bearish tone in terms of the overall, and most of that bearish tone is coming from the press. I'm fairly bullish about our ability to deliver on 2016. I'm pretty bullish about our position in the marketplace to add backlog as \u2013 at least stay flat with backlog as we enter 2017. So the glass is half full, and I don't see the doom and gloom that a lot of people are and I guess your question kind of leads us towards.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Well, I guess just to \u2013 so just to be clear you said operating profit in the Oil & Gas should still be relatively strong or comparable to what we're going to see in 2016?","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","It's probably down some from the whole dollar basis from 2016 \u2013 or from 2015, excuse me, Jaime, go on into 2016, but as David says, it's still strong. It's not a precipitous decline but it is some degree of decline there. So that's reflected somewhat by the lower margin rate that was already led you...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But \u2013 no but I was more interested, I guess, in his 2017 commentary that it could still be pretty strong. Because I guess my question would be, if there's no big LNG project sitting, it doesn't sound like TCO is going to go anytime soon, so I'm just trying to figure out what I'm missing on, what you could book in terms of saying backlog could be flat with where we ended this year as we exit the year?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jaime, there's a lot of things out there, and people are still spending money. I mean, everybody wants to talk about LNG and TCO, but we've won four packages on refineries in Kuwait. We've won two projects in refining in Mexico. We've won refining projects in the United States with Tesoro and some others. So there's a lot of spending going on, and we're not hanging our hat on one or two projects. We, as a company, have over 2,500 active projects at any given time, and that's what gives us the strength and the confidence to be able to say, we've got a good solid hope. Now obviously, the sky could fall, but assuming that it doesn't, we should be in a good position as we end 2016.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And sorry and I promise I won't ask another question, just a clarification. The backlog comment was that related to Oil & Gas or the total company when you said it could be flat by the end of 2016?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Total company.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right, thanks. I'll get back in queue.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Thanks you. Next question comes from the Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks, Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Steve.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Good afternoon.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","David, how would describe the flow of FEED work at the moment because that obviously tends to be more steady? I guess I'm just kind of wondering what you've experienced in terms of the change in pace in FEED in the last few months. And maybe as you think about the whole company, which end market are you seeing the most new FEED work come in and which the least? And that kind of a trend positions into a question about sort of, is there a base level of Oil & Gas bookings that you think you could see over the next year as a result of kind of FEED and flow kind of work?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you got to peel the onion on Oil & Gas back a bit. But let's just talk about the other groups first. We're seeing an uptick in opportunity in the Infrastructure group. They kind of hit a lull as you ended 2014 and early 2015. And we're seeing a significant slate of opportunities that are there, and part of that is I think the U.S. government focus on infrastructure and the things that are necessary to keep the U.S. economy going. So that's a bright spot. We're seeing an uptick in terms of pharmaceutical and biotech opportunities. With the FDA approving drugs, some of those projects are getting off of the mark. We're seeing a significant amount of frontend work, study work on gas-fired power plants, and we see a pretty robust opportunity slate there.","When you look at Oil & Gas though you got to peel the onion and peel it this way. Number one, there is no drilling going on. You can read the rig counts just like anybody else. We don't have any exposure to that. You can look at the big deepwater drilling. The horizontal drilling in some difficult places, obviously, that's slowing, and we don't do that either. We are seeing, however, a fair amount of work in traditional offshore and traditional onshore upstream Oil & Gas and significant FEED work in those areas because there \u2013 the oil companies are going to take in their deep breath and they're looking at, okay, what are the priorities, and now, those priorities are coming out as studies and feeds in those markets. And those are slow, but they're coming.","I think the FEED activity that's picked up is, as I said earlier, has been in refining and it continues to be in petrochemicals and fine chemicals. So you kind of got to peel the onion and the things that we have exposure to. We're still seeing a pretty robust slate of frontend work that again gives us kind of visibility. Going back to Jamie's question about 2017, we've got good visibility into \u2013 the priority of the projects that our customers were taking, the economic viability of those projects based on current economic factors, and that's what leads us to say that we'll have a pretty robust \u2013 the award slate that's \u2013 in robust to me means equal to this year, and certainly provides some visibility into the opportunities of 2017. So again I go back to what I said during Jamie's question, the glass is half full. And it's half full for us because of the fact that we've really stuck to our customers, and we've answered their call for integrated solutions and capital efficiency.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","To better...","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that...","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","...reinforce David's earlier comment that the key variables seems to be one of timing as opposed to expectation.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, that's helpful. I guess you just sort of answered this next question, but it's sort of a bigger picture thing about \u2013 to what extent is this commodity price backdrop and macro outlook really causing you to rethink the way you do business versus just kind of the cost restructuring you did and making some of these strategic moves that you might have done anyway. Really just trying to gauge your perspective on how much hunkering down and really rethinking your overall business model there needs to be here. I mean it sounds like you said, it's kind of glass half full, and you think there's a lot out there. But I mean, do you feel the need to really rethink the way things are going or are they that sort of dire? It sounds like not.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's \u2013 that's a great question. I was at an event this morning at the Dallas Fed and the same kind of discussion was taking place. And it's interesting. I remember it, and I've said this on these calls before in private meetings with you guys. I sat in Saudi Arabia in 1997, and oil was $17 a barrel, up from $11. This isn't the first time me or people within our industry or our company have seen these kind of swings and volatility in markets. And they will fix themselves. I mean when you think \u2013 right now, there's an oversupply of oil products. There's an oversupply of gas. There's an oversupply of LNG. It's going to take a while for that to clear, but it will clear. And when you think about particularly Oil & Gas customers, they haven't said they're going to stop spending. They said they're going to cut their capital spending. And that just means that they're going to prioritize and look at those high-value projects which is one of the litmus test or selectivity sieves that we use in terms of what projects we actually pursue. So again, I think our strategy is sound in terms of how we want to face the market and how we want to deal with the customers and which projects do we want to prioritize on. But that does not mean that we're not going to continue to look at our strategy, focus on cash management, focus on lower \u2013 continuing to find areas of how we do our projects to lower cost to meet that demand that the customer is asking for in terms of capital efficiency. So we're going to continue to work and, as I said in the prepared remarks, focus on the things that we could control. And right now, that's how we focus on the customers and how we sell a different way of doing projects that delivers what they're asking for.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay, thanks a lot.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And next will come Andrew Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great, thanks for taking my question. There was a comment in the 10-K that you expect 38% of the backlog to burn this year. That implies about $17 billion of revenue. So I guess two parts from here, how much book and burn do you think is available to you with your current outlook here?","And then when we kind of marry that $17 billion number, assuming there isn't any book and burn in it, we know there is, but it does imply that margins are probably in the high 4% range. Can you just kind of give your thoughts on the implicit margin from that in the book and burn work that's available to this year?","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, that's sort of a backend way to give us to give real revenue guidance, and there's a fair amount of variability in terms of mix as we know \u2013 that's what we've experienced over the last couple of years on revenue. So I think that we'll not go too far in answering your question. But certainly, I think that much of what we have in revenues, substantial majority of it is already in backlog. If you look at how we've talked about margins over the last couple of months going back to the third quarter call and then presentation since then, if you aggregate that all together, you're probably on a consolidated basis somewhere in the plus 4% range, but where exactly that lands is \u2013 this is a tough call. There's just too many variables.","So we feel good about the extent that our revenues are covered significantly by what's in backlog. Yes, there is some book and burn. I think that as we said, the key variable there then is the timing of new awards and how fast that comes in. But we feel really good about the prospects of those new awards, but it's a little early to judge how they're going to play at what kind of a rate. So that's what we're watching as we go through the year.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got you. And then maybe, Biggs, on cash flow, I mean, it was a very good year on cash flow. I guess from here with, you mentioned, I think, it was in the \u2013 maybe in the K or maybe in the comments that the equipment businesses is one of the areas where you saw a little bit of weakness. Do you feel like you monetized some of your assets in that business and shore up the balance sheet, what do you think the puts and takes are, and what's the appetite for that newly expanded share repurchase plan as well?","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, as far as the equipment business goes, we are expecting some pickup in 2016 particular as water projects transition towards construction. So it has really come down as a result of lower mining activity, it came down year-over-year as a result of Afghanistan. But most of that was really reflected as lower levels of equipment back to the end of 2014. So we'll see, but we think that certainly there's prospects for that business to pick up as we support our own \u2013 just our own projects in construction in 2016.","In terms of capital deployment, as I said, initially, we've got \u2013 we have a healthy cash balance. We're really happy with how we generated cash last year and expect to do a great job of generating cash again this year, but we have some expenditures right in front of us in terms of the funding of the China fabrication joint venture. As I said in my comments, there is $500 million over the course of the year, just under $500 million that has to be funded. So over the very near term, I think we have places that we figure that will generate great returns over time to go invest in. Beyond that, our strategy remains the same as it has in the past typically.","We don't expect to preannounce any kind of a share repurchase program, what we expect to do is as we go through time evaluate our excess capital as it's generated, what to see first if there's some high investment opportunity that will create a good return for shareholders, high investment return opportunity that will create a great return for shareholders; and then in the absence of that, we'll look to see if we repurchase shares, just like we have in the past. But it's not a near-term analysis we have to go through because, as I said, we've got some near-term opportunities for our cash commitments we've already made. We'll generate good cash flow in the future. We had that expectation. So we look forward to having to do that analysis going forward.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And next will be Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","Good evening, everyone.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Michael.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","David, your observations of Middle East, you've mentioned about in 1999 when you're in Saudi, at $17 oil, given the geopolitics, given where oil is today and some of the hysteria you're seeing from the press and such, is that an area that can come back relatively quickly if oil prices come back? And is that an area where you could see some springboard to some business in 2017 and beyond? And being 2016 being more of an wait and see, are there still opportunities with low gas and chemical side that you can \u2013 and the refining side you can push through more opportunities in that world?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll get back to what I've said, Michael. They haven't stopped spending. So there's still a pretty robust slate of projects but mostly refining and petrochemical programs, just like you're seeing here in the States. So I think there's near-term opportunities. My experience out there suggests that it depends on how much of a return of the oil price happens and when. But I've seen them turn on a dime in terms of what they want to do. And I don't want to really call it a herd mentality, but they got these things pinned up on their drawing board, and they want to get them going, and they can move pretty rapidly.","As I said, I don't think you're going to see the supply situation change dramatically until as we get into the mid part of the year. But once that glut kind of clears, I think you can see commodity prices kind of stabilize if not rise as we get to the backend. But the other thing that I'd warn everybody about is when you think about the long-term nature of Oil & Gas developments, from exploratory well to production, it's a decade. So they're not thinking about spending today for tomorrow. They're thinking about spending today so that either the reserve base or their product mix or whatever is just focused on that further longer view. And they're going to continue to fund those projects that satisfy that need. So two ways answering your question, one, they can turn quick. I don't anticipate it in 2016, but you're just still going to see steady spending on the things that makes sense.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","David, follow up on your answer to one of the questions early, you have been at Dallas Fed presentation or something this morning. It seems \u2013 given to what you see in your business and the diversity that you've put forth, especially in infrastructure, manufacturing, life science, U.S. pipe opportunities, do you get the sense that your customer base and the diversity trend and even in Power is going to allow for some better activity from your U.S. customers allowing you to get some more business as we move through 2016, or is the concern about the economy that we read about in the press and hear and seen on TV all the time is more troublesome?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's \u2013 if I were to put a phrase on things, I'd say steady as she goes. I mean, when you think about life sciences, pharmaceuticals, well, the taxing regimes in places like Ireland and Singapore and some of the other places around the world have attracted those businesses, so that's not going to be a U.S.-based business by and large. I do still see the petrochemical resurgence in the United States continuing both in terms of additional crackers and to further downstream derivatives. So there's an example of where the U.S. will be there. The Westinghouse projects kind of skew us back towards almost at 50-50 or 60-40 kind of range in terms of U.S. versus non-U.S. business. But I still see more opportunities outside the United States than in the United States with the exception of maybe the Infrastructure business.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","David, thanks for your thoughts.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","And next will be Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Since no one's touched on it yet, maybe you can just address the issues on the Brunswick power project, and just maybe more specifically, you're saying mechanical activities are done, expected to be completely finished by spring. But what risk activities might be left between now and then that we maybe \u2013 should be concerned about or not?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good question. We're basically done. It's in final throes. The biggest issue is a startup condition where you introduce lube oil and you recycle lube oil and you make that change. The suppliers program and what we were told by our customers that it took 45 days, and it took us 90 days. So therein lies the majority of \u2013 and it took us past the third- end of the third quarter obviously and that was certainly not anticipated. But we're all but done in terms of the project. I said in the last call that we had it under control and there were no losses. So I'm not going to say it again, but we're ready to start this thing up. So I don't really anticipate anything that we haven't anticipated happened now.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it, thanks. And just secondly on \u2013 you made some comments on pricing. You are seeing some pressure. It doesn't seem like it's overwhelming. But maybe just talk about what the assumptions are for 2016 and maybe not just in the Oil & Gas but what you're seeing across Power and Infrastructure and some of the other businesses that are actually gaining a little momentum, is there becoming increasingly competitive given that Oil & Gas is falling or becoming weaker?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think you know the Power market is still a pretty tough market and will be for some time. I would never categorize it as easy. These are \u2013 there's a lot of competitors and they like to feed their house too. And depending on how hungry they are is to how they act in terms of pricing. So we still see that as pretty tough market. But again, the way we changed, the way we're doing work applies to Power, just like it applies to some of the other businesses. So we're kind of changing the game a little bit. And I think we've got a competitive offering.","Infrastructure is a little bit the same way. But we're starting to see some of these things come to fruition, and we're winning in things that we already know how to do, roads and light rail, and we're winning with acceptable margin with our partner. So I feel reasonably okay there.","The other businesses are doing quite fine. We talked a lot about Oil & Gas, our ability, and the quality of the margin backlog that I spoke off is I think a testament to change in the model with how we deliver, which makes us more competitive in the marketplace. Our Government business has done quite well. We really haven't talked about that, but we won Idaho and a really, really huge win for us and something we're really pleased with, which again if you think about it, that adds in \u2013 with the Stork acquisition, it adds to that non-commodity piece of our business, which should provide some stability in earnings over the longer term. Those are big long three-year to five-year kind of contracts. So again, going back to part of my comment with \u2013 to Jamie, that also gives us confidence in our ability to \u2013 in 2016 and start 2017 with a pretty robust capability in terms of earning potential. So this is a hard business, I mean. And it's always competitive. It's never easy in terms of what our competition confronts with or what our client expectations are. And I'm just really proud of our organization, how we respond to that, and how we've responded as an organization to a new way of doing business that results in better margin performance across the board.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just to summarize, I mean, it sounds like you are not assuming anything out of the norm relative to the last couple of years from pricing within the guidance for 2016, is that...","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Is that a fair statement?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's a fair statement. We're seeing \u2013 we are seeing some of our competitors in a little bit of dire straits, which you worry about in terms of what are they going to do next. But we feel good about what we are pursuing and how we're pursing it and whom we're pursing it for. That makes sense.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yep, thank you very much.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Next will be Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good evening and thank you for taking my question. Several questions actually, just to clarify some of the commentary that was already made. On the LNG comment, David, I assume you're talking about getting that, but kind of broadly, how much of your Oil & Gas backlog is linked to LNG, and there is \u2013 are there any other small expansion projects or maintenance projects that are still likely to be in the pipeline?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, my comment about LNG was more global, not necessarily within our \u2013 with ours. It is a general comment about LNG. But in my prepared remarks, I mentioned there's really no earnings in 2016 for LNG.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And what percentage of the backlog has been related to LNG, is there any?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We don't provide that.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. On the petrochem side of the business, you sound optimistic about the future and derivative plans involving the crackers. What is the status of the projects that you're working on right now?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, if you look at the three crackers in the U.S. we're working on, Dow and CPChem are well underway in construction. And on the intended schedules that we were there in terms of cost, we're right on target. Sasol is the one that's a little bit behind just in terms of schedule. We're in the field, but really only on a \u2013 in the civil side of the business and feel pretty good about where we are there. So I would say that they're progressing like we planned, and progressing quite nicely for those customers.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great. And then in the Power segment, can you update on the new scale filing timeline and investments that you're putting into new scale?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. As we said in the prepared \u2013 I think in Biggs's prepared remarks, we're looking at about $80 million to $90 million spend this year, leading up to the submittal of the design certification towards the first to the middle of the third quarter. We've had great conversations with the DoE and the NRC about their preparedness to review that submittal. We feel good about fact that our first customer has gotten into agreement with the DoE for a site for the first one in Idaho. And just the fact that we won the Idaho project, I think strengthens our ability to deliver on that. So we're on target. We feel good about what we're going to submit. We feel good about the NRC's readiness to do that review. And we think that opens the door for future investment and new scale from outside of Fluor.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Great, thank you very much.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And next question will come from Andrew Obin with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Guys, thanks all for taking call from me.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Andrew.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Andrew.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","You will be glad to know, Anna is back in one week.","Unknown Speaker","Really?","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah I know. So just a question as there is sort of taking a sort of 40,000-foot view, so you used 1990s as a reference to what's happening in the Oil & Gas cycle. So a lot of discussions we're having with clients. Do you think it's more like the 1990s or it's more like the 1980s? And what do we think the differences \u2013 implied differences on strategy if it's more like the 1980s?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the one thing that's not being spoken off is the demand growth in this discussion. And when you look at those demand growths, we're still looking at 1 million barrels a day kind of growth in the midterm, I would say. So when you think about some of the production that's going to naturally come off due to depletion curves, you look at \u2013 I guess, the Saudis and the Russians kind of put, for lack of a better term, a ceiling on production. You can see where that glut's going to clear pretty quickly.","I think, what's different this time is in lot of these producing countries their cost base has gone up because of the social programs. So I think, they're going to do what they can to turn this quick \u2013 more quickly than maybe would have taken place when you \u2013 even if you go back into the 1970s and what the embargo did. So I'm not sure, you can actually do a comparison to the 1990s, not sure you can do a comparison to the 1970s or even if you go back into the early 2000s when pricing went down.","I just think it's a different marker. And I'll give you an example. This is the first time in my career where \u2013 when the sabers rattle between anybody in the Middle East that threatens the Straits of Hormuz, and I'm speaking specifically about the issue between the Saudis and the Iranians that obviously was in the press, the oil price didn't spike by $10 a barrel the next day, and in fact, this time, it went down. So I would argue that the fundamentals are significantly different today in terms of who's producing and how much they're producing.","And the change in the flow of those products over the last decade, more gas, more LNG, LNG glut right now, oil is there, coal is bad. I mean I just think that there's a lot of issues that are different in this cycle than they were in the past. But I think the one thing that's going to drive maybe a quicker recovery than some of the historical times is the need for a cost per barrel to satisfy the social needs of some of these producers.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you for such a great answer. Just a follow-up, in talking to a lot of corporates, we're hearing that it's not about the price decline per se but it's also the price volatility that's inhibiting their ability to plan CapEx. In your conversations with your customers, how long \u2013 how much of a stability do we need to see in oil prices for them to get comfortable with putting plans out? Do you think it's one month, do you think it's three months, what are you hearing?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think they're already on a new level. I think that and I've said this before, I think many of them would say that they were drunk on $100 oil, my term, don't tell them I said that, and probably wouldn't have made some of the funding decisions that they made if they didn't in their backroom believe that $100 oil was there to stay. So I think in their backrooms now, they are thinking, you know $40, $50 kind of dollar range is the new norm, and we have to plan on that basis.","And we're already seeing them use a more reasonable number. I remember back in the day when they used to plan on $14 was the kind of the litmus test for capital spend. So it'll morph and change, but I think there's a huge wake-up call that $100 isn't something that that's there forever. But I also remember everybody saying the sky would fall and the world would end if it ever went above $100. That didn't happen either. So I think what we're hearing from our customers is there's kind of a new norm, and somewhere between $40 and $70 is probably the kind of the sweet spot for the longer term.","Andrew Burris Obin - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, folks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Tahira.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Hi, Tahira.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","First question is, David, you commented earlier on aggregate backlog potentially being flat as possible this year. Are there any segments in particular where you're more comfortable saying that than others?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think I've provided a little bit of color there. I mean, there's some growth opportunities in all of our businesses to a varying degree without \u2013 with \u2013 I would take mining out of that. There's really not any intended new awards in there, and we're finishing a couple of projects. So I continue to see I&I in terms of backlog drop because mining was such a huge piece of that.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But you think \u2013 I mean, $44 billion in backlog is almost at an all-time high, and we have the ability or we've stated we have the ability to stay at that level. I mean that speaks volumes of how powerful this company is in terms of satisfying customers and expanding our opportunities. So, again, I wouldn't point to anyone other than mining that's a bit of a challenge. Each of our groups has \u2013 have opportunities to grow.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And David, your sort of optimism or your upbeat note on Oil & Gas, within your mix, would you say that market share gains wise you stand pretty well but the fab yards? Is that also playing into your outlook?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We don't really look at it in those terms. I mean market share in this business is really a magic number. I mean it's \u2013 you got to really understand what goes into that total number to see what market share is. But what we have seen is a combination of the integrated solutions offering that includes fabrication, includes supply chain, includes a resurge in our direct hire construction capability is proving very effective with our customers. And I think the fact that we continue to pull in billions of dollars every quarter in Oil & Gas and, obviously, the other things that we do is a testimony to the customers' acceptance of our new way of doing business.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","You can add to that our ability to design the product differently.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. But I also...","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Fair enough.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think that our ability to continue to create or have a positive cash flow in some difficult markets is another testament to the strength of this company and what we can actually deliver. I mean it provides us with the ability to go places when others can't. I mean I go back to what Buffett says, and I am not signaling any more acquisitions. But Warren Buffett says that he's nervous when people are greedy, and he's greedy when people are nervous. Well, right now people are nervous.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we've got the powder to deal with the things we need to deal with.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, makes sense, David. I just had a brief last question. And if I look at what's making a lot of these projects economical again on the Oil & Gas side, it's clearly the costs have down for the project. Do you think you're at a point where your back bookings on an annualized basis are down considerably, so would it be fair to say that the scope at this point, even if it's reduced, it's kind of taken into consideration when you are talking about potentially backlog even in that segment being potentially flat at some point?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I mean I think it's puts and takes in this timing. As Biggs said earlier, when you think about the revenue, it's all timing of projects and where they are in their cycle. But I think being \u2013 having the kind of backlog where we are is interesting, but I would point you back to maybe four years ago when it was half of that.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So I think the way we position the company and the way we kind of changed our model when the markets move, and they will, I think we're in an outstanding position to take advantage of that, and we have significant upside potential. But I just think that that's further out in time then 2016, 2017. But we're ready, and I'm really pleased with the way the organization's responded to this volatility.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks, David.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","That does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much, operator, and thanks to all of you for participating today. As I said in my opening remarks, we do expect commodity prices to stay low, and we'll continue to drive customers' decisions. But I do know that they're going to continue to spend and focus on these high quality projects that we have in our sites.","As I've mentioned, our integrated solutions approach has met the demand in terms of our customers need for capital-efficient projects. And we'll continue to work on that and hopefully continue to drive down those costs. This is not a demand and that will subside when commodity price has begun to improve.","To that end, the changes we've made in our business model have prepared us for the next cycle. And that next cycle will come. We've been through this \u2013 I've been in this business a long time and what is now down will go up again. The evolution of our offerings, I think, has provided us with robust cash flow generation as I mentioned earlier and just strengthens our balance sheet and our ability to continue to operate. I think our cost management discipline also gives us an advantage and an opportunity to be more successful in the future. Not to say that 2016 is going to be an easy year, it's going to be a difficult year. But I think there's great opportunities as we go through this to continue to deliver for our shareholders.","With that, I greatly appreciate your interest in our company and the confidence that you provide us, and I wish you all a good day.","Operator","Well, thank you. And that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for participation today."],"9307":["Fluor (NYSE:FLR) Q1 2013 Earnings Call May  2, 2013  5:30 PM ET","Executives","Kenneth H.

The passcode of 4490608 will be required.","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ken Lockwood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Lockwood.","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thanks very much, operator. Welcome, everyone, to Fluor's First Quarter 2013 Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after the market closed, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making our prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding the forward-looking statements, which we have summarized on Slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today, and in the company's 10-K.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are also posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","We've also updated and posted our factbook on our website, which includes a 3-year financial recast for the organizational realignment that went in effect with this quarter's reporting and will be discussed somewhat on today's call.","With that, I'll turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, and thank you to everyone for joining us today. Today, as Ken said, we'll be reviewing our first quarter results and discussing the trends we see through the remainder of 2013.","If you would turn to Slide 3, I'd like to begin by covering some of our highlights of the first quarter's financial performance. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the quarter were $166 million or $1.02 per diluted share, which is up from $155 million or $0.91 per share in the first quarter 2012, which included the benefit of a lower tax rate. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $294 million, up 16% and $253 million a year ago. Segment profit results were driven by growth in Oil & Gas, Industrial & Infrastructure and Government segments. Oil & Gas segment profit was particularly strong, with first quarter results of $105 million, which is a 42% increase over last year. Consolidated revenue for the quarter was $7.2 billion, up 14% over last year, including a substantial increase in Oil & Gas. New awards for the quarter was strong at $6.5 billion, including $3.1 billion in Oil & Gas and $2.2 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure. Consolidated backlog was $37.5 billion, which is down from a year ago, primarily due to the downturn in the Mining & Metals market. More importantly, as we commented last quarter, we continue to see improving margins on our backlog, which is encouraging.","Our financial results are summarized on a table on Slide 4. I'll continue my remarks on Slide 5. Oil & Gas awards for the quarter included contracts for petrochemical facilities in the United States and China. Flour was selected by Dow Chemical for the expansion of their existing petrochemical facility in the Gulf Coast, including an ethylene cracker and associated power utilities and infrastructure facility upgrades. Ending Oil & Gas backlog was $18.6 billion, which is an increase of 11% from a year ago and a modest increase over last quarter. The Oil & Gas group continues to see strong demand for front-end engineering contracts, especially in petrochemical facilities, although expect new awards for the remainder of '13 to be fairly balanced across upstream, downstream and chemical markets.","Moving now to Industrial & Infrastructure. New awards for the quarter were $2.2 billion, including the Tappan Zee Bridge replacement in New York and the Horseshoe road project here in Dallas. Backlog declined to $16 billion compared to $23 billion a year ago as a result of continuing work-off associated with large mining projects, combined with the newer -- lower new award count over the past year. Now there were a number of news reports recently pertaining to issues and delays on various existing mining projects and new prospects, which are creating some challenge for 2013. We are close -- in close contact with these clients and continue to support their efforts. As a result of the organizational realignment that we noted in our earnings release, effective this quarter, financial results for Industrial & Infrastructure now include the operations and maintenance piece of the Global Services segment.","If you turn to Slide 6, ending backlog for Government segment was $964 million, which compares to $695 million a year ago. New awards in the first quarter were $756 million, driven primarily by the timing of LOGCAP IV task orders. 2013, we expect task order awards under LOGCAP IV to remain at or near existing levels. With regard to sequestration, we have seen some impact on our funding at Savannah River, and we don't believe the overall impact will be significant. We're also seeing some delays in the customers' decision-making timetable on some of the services prospects that we are bidding on.","Moving to Global Services. The segment reported $28 million in segment profit and $150 million in revenue. Results for the first quarter were lower than a year ago due to the reduction -- excuse me, due to reduced contribution from AMECO. As a result of a shift from O&M to the Industrial & Infrastructure segment, there are no new awards or backlog for the Global Services segment since AMECO and TRS businesses are more transactional in nature.","Power segment new awards for the first quarter were $448 million, including the extension of a long-term fossil power maintenance contract in Texas and award of an engineering procurement construction contract for a solar facility in California. Segment backlog was $1.9 billion. The group is currently working on a number of gas-fired and solar projects, in addition to maintaining power facilities across the United States. The group continues to track opportunities for new gas-fired plants, alternative energy, including solar, as well as plant betterment programs.","On the nuclear front, last week we announced that a consortium with GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, Fluor's been awarded -- has been selected by Dominion Virginia Power to provide project development services for a proposed 1,475-megawatt nuclear unit at North Anna Power Station. Fluor will perform the engineering construction of the facility once Dominion Virginia Power receives federal permission to proceed, which is expected in 2015.","Please turn to Slide 7. In order to better align our company with our customers and markets we serve, as I previously mentioned, we have moved the operations and maintenance business line from the Global Services group segment to the Industrial & Infrastructure segment. In Industrial & Infrastructure, we have aligned the O&M business with our Manufacturing and Life Sciences group, which has a very similar customer base, with projects that are often smaller in nature and require a common skill set.","Our Global Services group, which includes our TRS staffing business and our equipment business, AMECO, have also -- they have responsibility for the company's strategically important construction, fabrication and supply chain solutions organizations.","I believe that expanding our capability in fabrication and modularization, increasing the amount of self-performed construction and applying the best-in-class global supply chain solutions will allow us to leverage our knowledge and expertise and capitalize on the opportunities that we see ahead of us, particularly in Oil & Gas.","With regard to fabrication, we have previously announced a joint venture company that we established with AGP -- AG&P in the Philippines. This quarter, we completed the purchase of an Australian-based company that specializes in fabrication and pressure welding.","In addition, we just announced the formation of a partnership with Supreme Group, a modular fabricator in Canada. This relationship enhances our construction and modularization capacity in North America and specifically in Canada.","With that summary, I'll now turn it over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 of the presentation. As David indicated, consolidated backlog at quarter end was $37.5 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog rose to 18% at quarter end, with the booking of 2 large infrastructure projects. About 2\/3 of first quarter awards were for U.S.-based projects, which drove an increase in the backlog for projects located in the United States to 32%.","Moving to corporate items on Slide 9. G&A expense for the quarter was $33 million, which is an improvement from $38 million a year ago, primarily due to lower compensation expense. The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 30%. We expect the rate for the full year to be in the 32% to 34% range.","Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's financial condition remains strong, with cash plus current and non-current marketable securities totaling $2.5 billion. This compares with a balance of $2.6 billion last quarter.","Cash flow during the first quarter was seasonally weak, with operating activities utilizing $22 million during the quarter. As we have said in the past, we take a number of factors into account when deciding whether or not to repurchase shares in any given quarter, including cash flow generation from operations. While we did not repurchase any shares during the quarter, we expect to continue our repurchase program in 2013, with repurchases biased towards the second half of the year.","I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2013, which is on Slide 10. We are pleased with our financial results for the quarter, including $6.5 billion in new awards. We continue to experience headwinds and uncertainty in Mining & Metals, as David noted, which may put pressure on our ability to achieve or exceed the very high end of our range. However, we are very encouraged by the strength of our Oil & Gas business and the substantial contributions from Industrial & Infrastructure.","Considering the overall portfolio, we are maintaining our EPS guidance at the previously established range of $3.85 to $4.35 per share. With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we will go first to Jamie Cook of Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So, of course, I need to ask the question. I was pleasantly surprised by the margin performance in the quarter of the 3.8%. So can you just tell me how that stood relative to sort of your expectations? And what were the drivers? And then what's the likelihood that we could actually hit a 4% margin in the quarter? I guess that's my first question. And then I have one more after that.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we're right on plan with what we anticipated with that margin production. As I've said before, Jamie, we see a strengthening in the margin and backlog. We've seen a general improvement in the markets that we're serving. We're starting to see demand pick up, I think, pretty quickly. You've seen the new awards and particularly the change in the new award totals in the United States, primarily on the back of the Dow announcement but certainly others. So I think we're on track with what we thought we would have relative to a buildup of margin within the specific businesses. But particularly, I think Oil & Gas improvement is something we've anticipated and talked about, and clearly, right now, I think we're starting to see it. I don't know when we'll get to 4%, but I would say that I'm very pleased with where we are and particularly where we're headed with the programs that we're very active on but have yet to book the EPC values of those programs.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then when we think about sort of -- you mentioned in your slides about maybe the high end not really being as likely, just given some of the things that you're seeing in mining. I guess, why not lower the high end at this point if that's out there? Or is there something that you think could potentially better to offset that, which is not making you take the high end down?","David T. Seaton","I think what we said was the headwinds, and I think that's a good way of describing it. I've never changed a guidance or a number in my career in the first quarter unless it was some significant event that would dictate that we do so. I think that we're in a very good position to perform at what our plan is, even with the headwinds that we talked about. And the upper end is not out of the question. It's just a hell of a lot harder with the headwinds from mining that we're seeing right now.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And then, sorry, last, just a modeling question. On the earnings from noncontrolling interest, it was much -- the number was bigger than I guess I would have expected. Can you just sort of talk about what's driving behind that and how we should think about that for the year?","Biggs C. Porter","It was higher for the quarter and higher for the quarter than we would expect in succeeding quarters. It's really just a mix of business. It depends upon the performance of each joint venture relative to the performance of projects which are wholly Fluor's in execution. And it really just comes in and out of the P&L. It's added into income before tax. Tax is calculated, and then it's taken right back again to get to net income attributable to Fluor. So it really has no net effect on the P&L, but it does have a somewhat, I don't know, cosmetic effect on the tax rate, which you really have to set aside.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz of Barclays.","Mark Mihallo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's actually Mark Mihallo on for Andy. First question I just had was around, I guess, the Oil & Gas business and your future outlook on that. So you had a very good book-to-bill in the quarter. And I guess your conviction around that book-to-bill being out 1x are better over the back half of the year.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we're in the early stages of a pretty good growth curve, as we stated before. We're in the very beginnings of, I think, several major programs in the United States. We're in the beginning stages of major oil and gas programs around the globe as well. I think everybody wants to talk about shale gas in the Gulf Coast, which is a great story. And I've said previously, we're in the early stages of $35 billion worth of EPC value, some of which went in during the quarter for Dow and some other things. So I think we're on the very early stages of a pretty good growth cycle that I think has a pretty good link through that cycle. I'm expecting some really big things out of that group and I'm quite bullish on the market.","Mark Mihallo - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Right. And just to follow up on Pascua-Lama. So how much work, if any, were you able to do on Pascua-Lama? And is it fair to say that it's going to be a several cent hit to your income statement each quarter going forward?","David T. Seaton","I don't know about that. I think we're continuing to support Barrick on Pascua-Lama. The Argentinian side really didn't slow down, and that is the process side of that particular project. And we're continuing to obviously execute that. We did have a slowing on the Chilean side because of the things that you've seen. But we're supporting Barrick in the resubmission of their documents to support the permits and what they need to continue the project. Obviously, it's going to slow, but I'll say it's headwinds, it's not major hits. So I'm not sure you're going to see it really impact us greatly.","Operator","And moving on to Jerry Revich of Goldman Sachs.","Ravi Gill - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","This is Ravi Gill on for Jerry. David, it's been about 2 decades since we've had a meaningful chemical CapEx cycle in the U.S. Can you help us frame what market share your franchise historically garnered on the EPC side in ethylene and propylene in the Middle East and Asia, and how we should think about that relative to the United States?","David T. Seaton","I'm not sure we look at things in terms of market share. I think the way I would categorize it is we spend a lot of time focusing on creating some relationships with some key clients that gave us a competitive advantage. The alliances that we have with Dow, with BASF, with Shell, the relationships we have with people like Sasol and others, I think, positions us to do the majority of the work in this cycle. And I think that's synonymous with the relationships that we've had with people like SABIC in Saudi Arabia and ARAMCOs and the like in the Middle East in previous cycles. Now we have those relationships as well, but I think what we're seeing specific to the United States is their need to get ahead of the curve because of cheap gas and, frankly, the resurging of manufacturing in the United States, which are both really good stories. I think that our teams have done an outstanding job of positioning with these customers for these key projects. We feel comfortable with the capacities that we have, both in terms of management and engineering talent, our supply chain capabilities, as well as the craft side. So I think our customers are recognizing the value that they see in our ability to deliver both in terms of cost and schedule. So I look at it as almost a perfect storm for us because we've really spent the time to invest in what we needed in order to take advantage of these programs and projects and win as much as we care to.","Ravi Gill - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then -- so given some of the developments over the past quarter, the Dow announcement this morning, the large ammonia project earlier in the month, can you just provide your updated assessment on when you believe the large greenfield projects in chemicals will get awarded? And which chemicals do you see moving ahead first, ammonia, ethylene or propylene?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it depends on how you define greenfield. I mean, most of these facilities are built on existing production sites. So when I think about greenfield, I think about a true greenfield. Now the Dow cracker is a greenfield cracker, but it's on an existing site as part of another -- of an overall program. But I do believe the ethylene business will be ahead. Ethylene, propylene, polyethylene and that chain will be ahead of the other products that they're used for. I think GTL and, in some cases, LNG are next and power usage will be last and only last because of the delay in the Casper rules by the EPA, which doesn't give the generators good clarity on what they need to do relative to their generating base and balance. So I think it just delays that. But in all cases, it fits within our sweet spot of being able to execute for our customers. So regardless of the sequence, we'll be very active in all counts.","Operator","And next up from UBS, Steven Fisher.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, previously, you had expressed some concerns about the permitting process in some of these U.S. shale projects. I guess, what are your latest thoughts on that front? And then do you have any other concerns about costs or end demand holding up any of the awards?","David T. Seaton","Well, my comments on permitting, I think, were basically just the timing that's normally necessary. We don't necessarily see that being a major holdup, but obviously it could be. based on backlog because there's so many projects that are going to be vying for those permits at the same time. But there's really nothing that I see that stands in the way. I think the only pinch point is going to be in terms of craft labor. But if you look at our strategy around fabrication and the supply chain, we're able to take a fair amount of the construction off the sites into a controlled environment to improve the quality. We are way out in front relative to training centers and recruiting of the Fluor craft that we've always enjoyed in that area. So I think these first projects that we're doing, I don't see any significant issues standing in the way of them having a normal schedule trajectory.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just over to NuScale. Can you just give us an update on your process there and your confidence that you'll be able to sell down a stake in that this year?","David T. Seaton","A lot of discussions right now on potential investors. We feel good about where we stand, there. We've limited -- as I've said in the previous quarter, we've limited the expense by putting John Hopkins in there to manage that business in a much more forceful manner. I think we've done a very good job of controlling that. The second FOA is out, and we're actively pursuing that.","Operator","And moving on to Andrew Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just to dig in a little bit more into some of the shale-driven infrastructure projects. I'm kind of curious as to -- not specifically but maybe in generalities, if you could comment on what some of those terms like -- look like. Are those -- are you able to get reimbursable style contracts on those type projects, David, or is that more on a fixed price basis today? And do you see change as we go deeper in...","David T. Seaton","Yes, those are primarily reimbursable, those contracts.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. Is that something that your business model's afforded you to do, allowed you to win, whereas maybe your competition are trying to do it a different way? Or is that just kind of the standard one?","David T. Seaton","No, I think those decisions were based on the value proposition and the project people that we have to offer versus the others. I'd say that the clients were making value decisions. We've got the ability to do them under a various commercial approaches. Reimbursable is fine, fixed price is fine, regardless of whether it's in the Gulf Coast or whether it's some place else. We really spend a lot of time and effort in improving that capability, but I think primarily, we've had a very strong position in gas market programs regardless of what the usage is. And I think that what you're seeing today is just that value proposition shining through.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Great. And then maybe up in the oil sands, David. Given some of the discounts that we've seen up there and some CapEx cuts, can you just talk about the project level activity that you're seeing out in the market today? Is that potentially continuing to be a growth area as you look through the balance of the year? Is that still kind of flat at a high level?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it's a growth story, frankly. And I think the limitation and some of the discounts you're talking about in the gas side, I think, are temporary. If you remember, we still don't have Keystone pipeline going or any other infrastructure. So I think some people are kind of hedging their bets on when will the infrastructure be there to support some of these developments. There's nothing standing in the way at the moment. But when you look towards some of the bigger users, the LNG plants and the like, we really need to have that infrastructure underway and ready when these plants start up. That's really the only hampering point that I see in this equation. But I think any pullback right now is temporary.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tahira Afzal of KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","My first question is really in regards to something, I guess, everyone's already asking about the petrochem side so I'll let that one be. And when you're talking about the labor market in general, one of the projections I've seen is craft labor probably going up 35% or so between now and 2015 and some migration of labor maybe from the Midwest space down to help out. So, I mean, it seems like some of the projects might get a little pushed out versus canceled outright. Is that -- when you're actually doing your projections, are you assuming that some projects are more cascaded versus everything sort of getting done at the same time and a peak coming out more closer to 2016?","David T. Seaton","No, I really don't see things being pushed out, Tahira. And I think from a cost escalation point and a productivity perspective, those things are already part of the planning process. Everybody sees the same data you do in our customer base. So I think it's a good, healthy debate on what those protection factors are, but that's not delaying any of the programs that are there. I think that a comprehensive immigration bill would be helpful to the circumstance. This country's been built on immigration, and I don't know why this next cycle would not enjoy the same support because I think there's going to be plenty to go around. I think that what we're going to see is a circumstance where the traveler will come back. I think over the last decade or maybe 2 decades in the United States, we've seen a lack of willingness on the craft part to travel more than one state away. I think we're going to see a change in that. And we're already seeing people coming to us from 3 and 4 and 5 states away. They were ready to come to the Gulf Coast and work. So we're going to have to be careful about craft labor, but I don't see that being an Achilles' heel to the schedules that people are thinking about or cancel in any way the projects that we're focused on.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And as a follow-up, you've obviously taken a great start to the petrochem cycle with the Dow announcement today. That was clearly an important win and really bodes well for the cycle. When I look at Sasol, they obviously have a very large project prospect in play as well, and it seems they've already put in the lead procurement item orders. So if you look out over the next 9 months or so, how many of these petrochem projects outside of Dow do you really see going forward which are a fairly decent size?","David T. Seaton","I think most of what we're looking at have a better-than-average chance of going forward over the next probably 4 quarters, both in terms of the ethylene and petrochemical side, the gas and liquids side and a growing optimism on LNG in Canada and in the Gulf Coast. So I see a pretty good collection of projects that are going to be awarded and announced basically on the schedule that we're anticipating.","Operator","And we'll go to Alex Rygiel of FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Two questions. First, David, you mentioned that you're seeing some improved margins in backlog. What specifically is the catalyst to it? Is it just a shift in mix of what's in your backlog? Is it some improved pricing in certain end markets?","David T. Seaton","I think it's a collection of all of the above. I mean, I think we are seeing a shift back towards the Oil & Gas business in an EPC form, which is always good. We are seeing some improvement in pricing, but I wouldn't suggest that it's overly so. Also, I think that we spend a lot of time in improving our work processes to become more efficient both in terms of reimbursable and fixed price projects, which help add to that margin equation, and also when you think about the leverage we get when we start to really burn hours on the engineering side as it relates to overhead, space, computing, those fixed costs that we have. So I think all of that adds to, I think, improved margin and backlog, and I think it'll continue to improve as we go through the next probably 6 quarters.","Biggs C. Porter","I would just add, the shift in I&I from mining awards, infrastructure awards also increases margin and backlog.","David T. Seaton","Right.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And one more question. Sort of in the I&I category, when do you think we might hit that equilibrium where new awards approximates revenue burn?","Biggs C. Porter","I don't know, that's something that...","David T. Seaton","We haven't really looked at it that way.","Biggs C. Porter","We forecast -- especially with awards always being lumpy, as we say, it's kind of hard to do a forecast.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I guess maybe if I could ask that another way. How much further revenue burn in the mining sector is sort of necessary to get back to a, I don't know, sort of a run rate backlog in mining?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think over the next probably 3 quarters, we're going to be burning significant revenue in the mining segment. That's the normal burn-off. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we're just not filling it up with as much new awards on the same basis. So I can't give you a time, but I think it's fair to say that we are moving in that direction with mining.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we'll go to Michael Dudas of Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","David, keeping it on the infrastructure track. Historically, Fluor's booked maybe 1 large infrastructure project a year. Obviously, you've got 2 nice awards kind of, of recent note. Could you update us on -- has more opportunities been accelerated over the past couple of months? And could we see some more positive activity on booking for Fluor as we move into 2014?","David T. Seaton","That's a great question, Michael. I think I'd answer it in a couple of different ways. One is, obviously, Horseshoe and Tappan Zee coming in 1 quarter is unusual. To your point, it will typically spread out. I will say that we've had an increase in the proposal activity over the last little while. And we have a fair amount of procurements that are in the early stages that will hopefully be awarded as we get towards maybe the end of this year, early next year. But we're really pleased with what we're getting. We have not been successful in a couple that we bid in that big tranche of bidding, but clearly, we won the ones that were strategically important to us and fit our offering quite well. But I still see significant growth in Infrastructure. I mean, just the pent-up demand in the United States is there. One thing that the Congress did very well was the reauthorization of TIFIA program that helps support these programs. We're seeing a fair amount of the PPP market start to come back in a large way and things like light rail, toll roads and the like. So to use the term we've always used, and Biggs' just used of lumpy, I still see growth in Infrastructure.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","That's helpful. And David, just my follow-up would be, as you're looking at the mining customers, so it seems -- does it seem like it's a little bit more of a pause given where capital spending trends and outlooks have been from some of the big ore or these iron ore or hard rock mining customers? Or is this still just people just trying to figure out where the cycle is going to be?","David T. Seaton","I think to use your term, I think they're taking a deep breath. Some of these -- in every mining project that I've ever seen, there's always the issue of permitting and labor unrest that puts these projects into fits and takes. And they do slow down from time to time. I think this is more of a structural deep breath, driven by the commodity markets but also driven by the change in leadership. And even when I -- I mean, it was seamless when I took over from Alan, but even at that, I took some time to think about where we were headed and the things that we needed to do and what those priorities were. And my expectation is the folks at Rio and the folks at BHP and the like are doing the same thing. So I think that just adds to the deepness of the breath, so to speak. But I don't, by any means, think that there's a long-term structural change in the market nor a significant long-term delay in capital spending.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","Certainly maybe where the projects are going to be built might change it because of nationalization, government and the like...","David T. Seaton","That's always been the case, and I don't think that will change. I mean, one thing about it, both -- for all the extractive industries, they have to go to some interesting places to gain access to those liquids and ores.","Operator","And we'll go to Robert Connors of Stifel, Nicolaus.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just for housekeeping purposes, with the O&M business outside of Global Services, it was pretty good margin in the quarter. I mean, is this sort of the run rate? Or were there some onetime things in there that won't be continuing going forward?","David T. Seaton","The run rate in I&I or in Global Services?","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Yes, in the Global Services margin.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think there's opportunities for improvement there. The reason we made that change is client preferences, skill set coordination and I think a fair amount of focus on the smaller projects, which fits within that group's capabilities that drove that decision. And I think the margin, I think, should improve over time. But again, we're still waiting on -- outside of power, we're still waiting on that shutdown turnaround market to return, and obviously, that would be an impetus to improve margin.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then related to the Supreme and AG&P joint ventures, just wondering if Fluor is able to begin fabrication of the modular components for a lot of the Gulf Coast petchem facilities before you guys or before -- excuse me, the client receives their permit approval. And if so, is that already occurring for some projects that we haven't heard or that haven't been press released yet by Fluor?","David T. Seaton","Well, those 2 specifically and other actions that we're taking, I think, add to our ability to supply what's needed by our customers. The schedules, we're on schedule to be able to supply whatever's necessary on those schedules, those various projects, and we feel good about those. I'm less concerned about delays because of permits on these petrochemical facilities than maybe some other use of gas. And the reason is, is that most of these new facilities are on existing facilities that already produce the same types of materials and products. And I think that the permitting process will not be encumbered by some of the new regulations that are out there. So I feel pretty good about where we are on the timing of these programs, and I'm very comfortable with our ability to provide the fabricated modules for those projects based on the schedules that we've produced for the customers.","Operator","And going next to John Rogers from D.A. Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just wanted to follow up on one thing. David, in the past, you've talked about investing more in modular fabrications, self-performing work, and I know you've acquired some assets in Australia, and partnership up in Canada. Is there more to do there and particularly in the U.S.?","David T. Seaton","Absolutely.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","And will we see that soon? Or, I mean, is that something you'll acquire or build yourselves?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we're in the process of making those decisions right now, and I really don't want to get into that. But we're clearly going to do more in the Gulf Coast to support those programs and support the local labor capabilities in those regions.","Operator","And we'll take a question from Andrew Wittmann of Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","So I just wanted to check in on the gas plant opportunity. David, earlier, you kind of went through the cadence of how you thought some of the gas infrastructure things will play out, and lowest on that list sounded like gas power generation. Yet you noted in your prepared remarks that there's probably, I think you said a handful of maybe 6 or something that you're looking at today. Can you just talk about the likelihood of those going or maybe when you think those could make sense? And then just specifically, I think previously, you commented that this year would be a $15 million to $20 million kind of profit year for the Power business. Is that still the case?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it's delayed, frankly. We've done a lot of studies on gas plants and continue to do that. I think the delay in Casper is the reason for that. If you're a generator and the regulators aren't giving you the answers you need to make your capital decisions on, you're going to have to push that out until you have that data. And I think the delay of Casper was not a good decision. If you're a generator, you're sitting there with a coal fleet that they know they've got to fix, they're ready to fix. The CEO of Duke, I think it was last year, made the comment that they're ready to spend $20 billion on dealing with their coal fleet if they just knew what the rules were. And in that, and I know I'm mixing things up, but gas is going to replace some of that coal fleet. And until they really know the capacity that they have to replace, they don't know exactly which gas projects to sanction and move forward with. So I think the delay in those rules was not a positive step in the right direction, particularly when it comes to fuel supply mix for the generators or, quite frankly, job creation in the United States.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And then -- but so specifically on the profitability of that segment, does that change your previous comments there? Is this more of a breakeven year for the Power group then, do you think?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think the earning -- I think we're still looking at -- now we're looking more at '14 for the improvement in profitability for Power.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got you. And then just one more on the Government business. There's been a change in opinion on the Y-12\/Pantex management contract. Just kind of your updated thoughts there, how you think you're positioned for, I guess, the rebid there and as well as maybe some comments on Sandia, if any.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think on Y-12, you've seen the reports that I've seen. We did not believe that, that decision was based on all the facts, and we're glad that the government has intervened and will give a chance for all the facts to come out. We feel very good about the team that we were part of, and we look forward to recompeting that. On Sandia, I really wouldn't want to comment at this point. We'll just see how that comes out. But I think the government group's done a really good job of diversifying their offering. As we said in our prepared remarks, we don't see any significant change in the LOGCAP production performance over this year and into next year. And those guys were working really hard to find ways of filling that earnings stream up with other work with the U.S. federal government and the governments outside the United States.","Operator","And we'll take our question from Will Gabrielski of Lazard.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Sorry if my first question is a repeat, but did you guys give an updated specific on your NuScale spend and whether that's being addressed with the FOA in process?","David T. Seaton","No, we didn't give a specific update on NuScale, but I think it's consistent with what we had said before. We don't see any change with or without FOA in this year.","Biggs C. Porter","See, our total guidance for the year is the same. We said around $0.20 a share impact for the full year. Run rate in the first quarter may be a little higher than that because we were still leaving -- coming out of last year at a little higher pace and bringing it down to some level of moderation. But no change to the full year expectation.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And over the past few months, we've finally seen confirmation of what you guys have been talking about for the last few years in terms of the aggressive pricing in the Middle East. And 2 questions off of that. One, are you seeing anything changing on the competitive landscape right now? And two, is there any opportunity for you on jobs that are behind schedule or didn't have a program manager involved that are running over budget to go in and maybe pick up some work?","David T. Seaton","Well, we've already seen some of that, where we've been asked by certain customers to come in and support finishing some of these programs. I think it does provide the opportunity that I spoke of 2 years ago when people said we couldn't compete against the Asian contractor. We've done quite well. We've continued to grow. And frankly speaking, when you fail in front of a customer, their memories aren't significantly longer but they are longer. And they turn to people like us that have proven execution capabilities, have delivered for them over the longer term and they go back to a value judgment. I think we've seen that probably for the last, I don't know, year. And that's evidenced by the FEED work that we're doing that's pretty global in nature in terms of Mining & Metals and specifically when you look at Ma'aden and our ability to win the phosphate project. I think in terms of petrochemicals both in the United States and in the Middle East, we've also picked up some early work that would not go to some of those contractors because of their lack of performance. So I think we like to just tell it like we see it. As I said a long time ago, this is the third time I've seen this from the Asian contractors, and we will see it again. But I think what we're trying to focus on is doing the right things to have good, solid growth, to be able to perform and finish these projects for our customers as they anticipate. Because you've got to remember, all of our customers don't make a dime until we turn the switch to turn that thing on, and they're eager for that day. And those that historically can allow them to turn that switch on the date that they anticipated, they're going to continue to come back to people like Fluor because that's what we deliver.","Operator","And that concludes our question-and-answer session. I'll now turn things back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","David T. Seaton","Thank you, operator. And thank you, everyone, for participating this afternoon. Based on our strong results for the first quarter, we think we're off to a good start, even with the challenging situation that we've seen in mining recently. As you gathered on the call, I'm particularly pleased where Oil & Gas group is heading. I'm very pleased with where I&I is heading, given the challenges that they have and the way they've been able to shift their resources to focus on projects and infrastructure and others that will continue to help us grow this company. I believe that our strategic focus on construction, fabrication and supply chain management further enhances our ability to provide and integrate the solution to our customers and enhances our overall market position. With that, I really appreciate your interest in Fluor, as well as your confidence in our great company. Have a good day.","Operator","And once again, that concludes our call.

The pass code of 9088046 will be required.","At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Ken Lockwood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thanks, operator. Welcome, everyone, to Fluor's Fourth Quarter and 2012 Year End Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after the market closed, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making our prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in the company's Form 10-K, which was also filed earlier today.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us. I'll apologize ahead of time for any sniffles or coughs that occur during my answers or prepared remarks. I'm fighting a little bit of a cold here. But as Ken said, today we want to review our fourth quarter and full year 2012 results and discuss our outlook for 2013.","If you'll turn to Slide 3, I'd like to cover the 2012 full year performance. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the year were $456 million or $2.71 per diluted share, which compares to $594 million or $3.40 per share in 2011. Our financial results for 2012 were impacted by the unexpected adverse arbitration decision on the Greater Gabbard claim, which we announced back in November. After a thorough evaluation of the arbiter's decision, we booked a pretax charge of $416 million or $1.57 per diluted share on an after-tax basis. Excluding this charge, net earnings attributable to Fluor for 2012 would have been $4.28 per diluted share.","Segment profits results for 2012 reflected strong double-digit growth in Oil & Gas and Global Services, with strength in Industrial & Infrastructure, notwithstanding the Greater Gabbard arbitration decision.","Fluor delivered in that case a quality project, which is generating electricity at a rate that the client has said is ahead of their own expectations. And as you're aware, we expect arbitration proceedings in the client's counterclaim to commence in the spring.","Consolidated revenue for the year was a record $27.6 billion, representing an 18% increase over last year, due in part to strong growth in Oil & Gas segment, as well as Mining & Metals business lines.","New awards for 2012 were strong at $27.1 billion, including $12.6 billion in Oil & Gas and $9.5 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure. Consolidated backlog at year end was $38.2 billion, which compares to $39.5 billion a year ago. In addition, we have seen improvement in the margin of our backlog over the last several quarters.","Now please turn to Slide 4. Oil & Gas awards in the quarter include a petrochemical facility for BASF in Europe and Asia and a petrochemical facility for Braskem in Mexico. Oil & Gas backlog ended the year at $18.2 billion, which represents a 21% increase over a year ago.","Now the Oil & Gas group continues to see strong demand for front-end engineering contracts, especially for petrochemical facilities. As we move through 2013, we expect a balanced slate of new awards with major prospects across upstream, downstream and chemical market -- petrochemical markets.","The Industrial & Infrastructure grew the backlog. At the end of the year, it was $15.5 billion, which is down from $20 billion a year ago. This decline was driven by significant progress on existing mining projects coupled with the cancellation of 2 mining projects in the third quarter of last year that totaled $2 billion.","Fourth quarter new awards were $3 billion, including significant additional scope on the Pascua-Lama copper mining project in Chile and Argentina for Barrick Gold. The I&I group also booked a program management contract for Ma'aden's large new phosphate complex in Saudi Arabia.","Within the infrastructure business line, demand for large transportation projects remain solid, and the fourth quarter was a great indicator of how strong this market is expected to be for Fluor.","In November, we were selected as the EPC contractor for the Horseshoe interchange project in downtown Dallas. In December, the New York Department of Transportation selected a Fluor-led team to build the Tappan Zee Bridge north of Manhattan. We expect to book Fluor share of these 2 projects totaling approximately $1.7 billion into backlog in the first quarter of this year.","Turning to Slide 5. New awards for the Government group in the fourth quarter were modest due to the timing of the LOGCAP IV task order awards. The group expects that task order awards under this contract will remain strong through 2013. Ending backlog for the Government segment was $978 million, which compares with $1.1 billion a year ago.","Moving to Global Services. The segment booked $211 million in new awards during the quarter, including maintenance agreements for major chemical, mining and steel production clients. Ending backlog was $1.7 billion. They are beginning to see modest improvements in the U.S. economic picture as they pursue new long-term contracts with major industrial customers.","Power segment new awards for the fourth quarter were modest at just under $100 million and ending backlog at $1.9 billion. The group is currently working on a number of gas-fired and solar projects, in addition to maintaining power facilities across the United States. Looking at 2013, the group expects opportunities for new gas-fired plants, alternative energy, including solar, as well as plant betterment programs.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Biggs to review some of the details of the operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. I want to start by commenting on our performance for the fourth quarter. Revenue in the fourth quarter was up over 12% from a year ago to $7 billion, mainly driven by significant growth in the Oil & Gas segment.","Regarding our earnings results for the quarter, there are obviously a number of moving parts, some of which were considered in our guidance and some that were not. So I think it would be helpful to summarize them for you. To do that, please turn to Slide 7.","The as reported EPS for the fourth quarter was a loss of $0.03 per share. The Greater Gabbard charge was a negative impact of $1.61 per share, which was not included in our guidance or in current analysts' consensus estimates.","The fourth quarter benefited from several positive items, the first of which was the sale of our equity interest in a telecommunications joint venture in the U.K., which yielded a $43 million pretax gain or approximately $0.17 per share benefit in the quarter. We talked about this in our last call and it was included in our guidance.","Next was a renegotiation of the terms of our LOGCAP IV contract to a fixed fee arrangement. You'll recall that in the third quarter, the Government group's operating results were significantly impacted by a lower-than-expected LOGCAP award fee score, which resulted in a downward revision of our fee assumption for the year. During the fourth quarter, we reached an agreement with the client to change the contract from an at-risk award fee to a fixed fee. This resulted in a $17 million improvement in the quarter or approximately $0.07 per share that was not in our guidance for 2012.","Furthermore, it should add predictability to our fee recognition in 2013 and beyond.","Finally, the lower-than-expected tax rate in the fourth quarter includes the release of previously unrecognized tax benefits and a net reduction of tax reserves totaling $43 million, reflecting the favorable resolution of a number of items.  Lower tax rate generated a benefit of about $0.26 per share in the fourth quarter, which is about double the amount we expected.","After considering all of these puts and takes, we posted a strong underlying fourth quarter results in Oil & Gas, Global Services and I&I. We also reduced G&A expenses in the quarter.","Moving to Slide 8. New awards for the fourth quarter were $5.1 billion, including $3 billion in Industrial & Infrastructure awards, and $1.7 billion in Oil & Gas awards. Fluor's consolidated backlog at year end was $38.2 billion, which is down modestly from $40.8 billion last quarter, as revenue burn outpaced new awards of $5.1 billion in the quarter.","The percentage of fixed-price contracts in our overall backlog was 15% at quarter end and the mix by geography held steady at 25% U.S. and 75% non-U.S.","Moving to corporate items on Slide 9. G&A expense for the fourth quarter was $41 million, below the $61 million reported a year ago, due to a number of contributing factors, but primarily due to improvements in foreign currency positions and lower executive bonuses. The full year tax rate of 22% was below our original estimates due to a number of favorable contributors that I've already reviewed.","Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor's financial condition remains very strong, with cash plus current and non-current marketable securities totaling $2.6 billion. This compares with the balance of $2.8 billion a year ago. During 2012, the company generated $628 million in cash flow from operating activities, repurchased $389 million worth of Fluor shares, including $225 million during the fourth quarter, and paid out a total of $129 million in dividends.","Finally, at our most recent meeting, Fluor's board approved an $8 million -- 8 million share increase in the company's share repurchase program, bringing the total number of shares available for repurchase to 11.8 million shares.","I will conclude my remarks by providing an update in our guidance for 2013, which is on Slide 10. In 2013, we remain encouraged by the opportunities across our diverse end markets and are maintaining our EPS guidance at the previously established range of $3.85 to $4.35 per share. Consistent with how we expect Oil & Gas revenue and margins to progress, we expect our quarterly earnings to grow as we go through the year as well. We have included R&D expenses that equate to approximately $0.20 per share for NuScale in 2013. In addition, our guidance assumes G&A expense of approximately $165 million to $175 million and an effective tax rate of 33% to 35%. We expect capital expenditures of approximately $350 million.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","A couple of questions. And, David, you brought it on yourself. You said that margins and backlog had improved. So can you talk about specifically what you're seeing in Oil & Gas? As some of your peers have come out and have talked about capacity tightening, in particular in the U.S. Gulf Coast, if you're seeing any of that and what the impact implications are for margins in the construction market longer term? And then you also said awards would be more it sounded like balanced throughout the year relative to before, I think, it was more back-end loaded, so you sound a little more constructive there. And last, ex the noise in I&I, your margins were really good at 5% -- 5.1%, so what drove that? And is that a function of some of these mining projects getting closer to completion?","David T. Seaton","No, well, I threw you a bone there on the margin question, and I'll answer that and kind of where I think the markets are headed and I'll probably answer some of the questions for the others. And I'll ask Biggs to talk a little bit about the I&I margins specifically. We are seeing, I think, a pretty strong opportunity list within Oil & Gas. And it is very diverse, both in terms of market and geography. We've been very successful in obtaining the front-end design on a number of programs. And assuming that the regulatory environment is possible -- is positive, it should be balanced as we go through the year, but I still think the significant EPC awards are back half of this year and into '14. So I think we've got the opportunity, I believe, just from the sheer amount of work that's coming to grow past where we were in the refining boom as we get into '14. Now, we have seen improvement in margin in our backlog, which is a good indicator of obviously future earnings. And that's a function of, I think, the value proposition that we hold with our customers. But I think we are seeing a little bit of tightening, but more in terms of making sure that the operators have access to the teams that they want, which does kind of look a little bit like the '07, '08 kind of time frame, where they're making sure they've got the project teams kind of committed to their long-term programs. And with that, it allows us to enjoy a little bit better margin. So I think the message is longer -- over the last half of this year and into '14, we've got a pretty good growth story in Oil & Gas. We've already seen improving margins in our backlog, and we continue to see that continue as we go through '13, which obviously results to better margin as we get into the back half of '13 and into '14. Biggs, do you want to mention or comment on the I&I?","Biggs C. Porter","Sure. And I'm not sure if you're asking broadly about margins to I&I, I'll try to address them both. The things that were already pointed out with respect to what affected margins in the quarter included the renegotiation of LOGCAP contract in the federal government group. And then within I&I, the sale of the equity interest and the $43 million gain on that certainly had a positive impact on margin. Beyond that, there are some other favorable items, most notably good performance on infrastructure projects within I&I. So underlying very good performance and a couple other things which weren't anticipated or which would cause little bit of an uptick in the form of the U.K. sale and the LOGCAP...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But, Biggs, are I&I margin is now structurally higher just because as we were getting to the latter end of some of these projects, because ex Gabbard and the gain, your margin was like 5%. I haven't seen a margin in I&I like that in a while. And I know you can't straightline it, but is it -- are we now more in the mid-4s or low 4s? How do we think about that?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, I don't know the -- I want to get to the point of giving the line item margin -- margin guidance for I&I. But as we said for quite a while, as mining goes down, that's lower margin activity and as the infrastructure business grows, that's higher margin activity. So you would expect I&I margins on that basis to be migrating upwards over time.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Andy Kaplowitz from Barclays.","Alan Fleming - Barclays Capital, Research Division","It's Alan Fleming standing in for Andy. Wanted to touch on the I&I revenue this quarter. It was down a bit sequentially. How should we think about that going forward? And should we be concerned about a faster decline in mining-related revenues?","David T. Seaton","No, I don't think so. I think -- we announced the Pascua-Lama additional scope, which is certainly a big part of that. I think we saw mining over the last probably 3 quarters kind of take a breath. And you also saw the changes in management on basically every senior mining house around the globe, where those management -- new management teams are going to take a little bit of time to prioritize their capital requirements. We haven't seen any of the things that we're looking at cancel, but I think they may move a quarter just because of new management teams. So I think that has an impact on backlog and revenue. At the same point, we're starting to front end on some pretty interesting programs in I&I. And we're on the very beginning pieces of things, like Tappan Zee and the like. So I think we're kind of at a transition point in I&I, where we're seeing the major programs kind of curtailed a little bit for the short term. At the same time, we're seeing some of the newer things come in. And I think that also lends itself to the margin question that Jamie asked, where we're working off some lower margin and putting in its place different kinds of projects at a higher margin.","Alan Fleming - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then if I could switch gears and ask you about NuScale and get some updated thoughts on that. If I'm correct, it looks like you did scale back your guidance for R&D related NuScale expense in the outlook this quarter. So how should we read that?","David T. Seaton","Well, I still have great faith in the technology. I think it's part of the energy mix. Obviously, we're disappointed in the fact that the Department of Energy failed to do what they said they were going to do relative to FOA. But needless to say, we're still bullish on the technology. However, we've taken some action to make sure that we're being prudent. As you saw, I asked John Hopkins to go take that job. He was a senior executive with Fluor who was retiring, because we needed to make sure we had a strong management team to look at how they were spending the money and where they were headed. I'm happy to report that John has made some changes, has lowered the overhead associated with the current day-to-day operation. He is very keenly focused on bringing in additional investors, and that looks very positive in the very short term. But in our planning, obviously we've got a plan based on not having any additional investors. And that's why we've got the $0.20. But I think the lowering of that, frankly, is in looking at a different execution program relative to getting this technology to the NRC for approval. I feel good about where we are. I feel good about the changes that have been made. And we're just going to be very prudent in how we go forward. One of the things within the FOA that doesn't get a lot of publicity is the fact that within that FOA, there is a requirement around the spend and the amount of money you have to spend to show progress for the government to qualify for the FOA funding. And without that, we've got an ability to turn it down a little bit until we're a little bit further down the road. And we feel comfortable with where the technology is.","Biggs C. Porter","So to David's point, before we -- in our guidance, we'd assume that our gross spending went up and got offset by funding from FOA. And that net number was the $0.20 per share we gave previously. Now, without FOA funding, we're still at $0.20 per share by taking down the total spend number.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] We'll hear next from Alex Rygiel with FBR.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","I got a few minutes to read your 10-K. And it looked like last year, 63% of your year-end backlog was to be recognized in 2012, which was about $25 billion. And this year you're saying about 55% of your year-end backlog is going to be recognized in 2013. So that sort of suggests that you're expecting to burn about 16% less or so year-over-year. I know you don't give revenue guidance, but should we be thinking that possibly revenue is flat to down here in 2013? Or are you seeing maybe a shift mix towards faster burn projects that just haven't come through yet?","David T. Seaton","Well, I wouldn't and I don't think your reading of it is consistent with what we see. I think there is a little bit of a mix change. I mean, just look at Oil & Gas where we've got a tremendous amount of front-end work, which is obviously quick book to burn, low revenue, higher-margin types of programs that are, obviously, the precursor to the EPC projects coming into backlog. So I don't -- I mean I understand what the case says, but I wouldn't necessarily agree with your assumption there. We would expect revenue growth in 2013.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And then just a quick follow-up. If we back out a lot of these sort of one-time items, it looks like $1.58 was really adjusted down to about $1.08, which was right on the mark and right in -- within your guidance for the full year of, get's you to $3.78. But you did previously have guidance that had a range as high as $3.90. Was there anything in the fourth quarter that maybe seemed to fall a little bit short or was everything, for the most part, right on the mark?","David T. Seaton","We were right on the mark.","Biggs C. Porter","Yes, I'll just add in. You have to maybe -- you have to listen very carefully. But on the tax, we did assume we were going to get a tax pickup. We just had a bigger one than we anticipated. So versus our guidance, I would not have backed out the entire tax benefit, maybe half of it.","Operator","And we'll hear next hear from UBS, and Steven Fisher.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just to follow up on Alan's question earlier. Your I&I book to bill was positive in the quarter, and you've got those 2 bookings coming up in the first quarter, but I know it's generally going to be a little bit lumpy. But I'm curious if you have any visibility as to when you think the book-to-bill in the I&I segment could kind of sustainably reach positive territory?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it -- I'd answer it 2 ways. I think we are seeing, as we get in through this year, additional mining opportunities, which will pick up. And then there's a fair amount of infrastructure programs that will be bid during the year with closing schedules in the -- kind of towards the end of the year, fourth quarter if not first quarter of '14. So I think it's probably going to -- it's going to be, as you said, lumpy until we get towards the back end of the year. We could see some further decline early this year but not markedly so. And I think we'll -- steady as she goes within I&I.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then just another follow-up. I think you mentioned that there were some potential buyers in the short term on NuScale. Did I hear that correctly?","David T. Seaton","Yes, investors.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Investors, okay. So does that mean that there could be a sell-down in your stake before any next FOA?","David T. Seaton","Could be. It only [ph] depends on what the investors want to see.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And if that would be the case, then presumably your $0.20 should be something lower than that?","David T. Seaton","Correct.","Operator","We'll hear next from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. Just hitting on I&I one more time. Just on the backlog, so it looks like you were down I think around $750 million sequentially. You guys had a huge order quarter. You guys burned, what, $2.8 billion of revenue. I don't know why backlog actually would have been down. Was there something that came out of backlog that we should be thinking about there?","David T. Seaton","Yes, primarily, there was a downward adjustment for some customer-furnished materials being taken out of scope.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Customer-furnished material, okay.","David T. Seaton","And that was the primary driver. I mean there was a number of things going on, the biggest single one would have been that.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got you. And just touching on the U.S. market, so it does sound like things -- like you were saying, tightening a little bit. People want to get in line with the 18%. Just curious, as far as your outlook for -- in regards to labor capacity in the market, do you see that as being an issue and an impediment to some of these projects getting [ph] off the ground? Or is there going to be enough -- the ability to bring more laborers in to execute these projects as being planned? Maybe you could just comment on that.","David T. Seaton","Yes, I think it's a good question. If you think about the professional staffs, the project management people, engineering and the like, we feel pretty good about where we stand in being able to increase that capacity pretty significantly over the short term, based on when these projects actually get their sanctioning. So we feel very good about our ability to kind of turn that crank and add folks. I think that the challenge is going to be in the craft. And we are seeing a tightening in that market that's driven primarily by retirements from the industry, an aging workforce and fewer people coming into the market. Now we've already started recreating our training centers in the Gulf Coast. We have a great following of construction management, superintendent kinds of resources, and with that brings the best craft. And I mean I feel very good that, that we'll be able to satisfy our needs because I do believe we're one of the, if not the, employer of choice both in terms of engineering but also of craft employees. So I do see a tightening, which I think will manifest itself in increased wage rates. And I think we'll have issues early on in this next boom, which I do think it's a boom with productivity in the early stages. But that's why we're spending so much attention on training and vetting these folks and having the right certifications for their skill sets.","Operator","We'll hear next from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","I guess my first question is as you folks start to see some of these larger bookings potentially coming in on the Oil & Gas side, you mentioned they're back-end loaded this year and more into 2014. So as you look at your margin trajectory within Oil & Gas and when it starts to sustainably grow above that 4% mark, should we expect that's possible this year? Or is that something -- should we be looking at this as being more of a transitional year for those margins?","David T. Seaton","Did Jamie put you up to that question?","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","No, no. But I am supposed to...","David T. Seaton","I'm kidding you, Tahira, I'm kidding you. I wouldn't venture a comment on when the margin would eclipse that 4% mark. I would suggest that we're driving hard to eclipse that number as we get through this year. We are seeing a marked improvement in those opportunities, partially because of the scope that we're taking on and the types of projects that fit our capability the best. I think Peter Oosterveer and his team have done a very good job in securing just about everything we were really chasing in some form or fashion. And in that, I think you're going to see a continued improvement in margin.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it, okay. And then my second question is maybe tied to what you were asked earlier. If you look back to your Analyst Day and the strategy laid out last year, you were hoping to self-perform more of the work and capture more of the margin. As you look at the U.S. market and given the prospects of high-end labor cost, craft labor costs going forward, how do you assess that risk? Has anything changed in terms of how much self-performed risk you're willing to take?","David T. Seaton","No, we're right on target. As I mentioned, you see -- you will see some escalation in rate and potentially degradation in productivity. But we know how to deal with that, both in terms of how we contract as well as in terms of how we manage our resources. There's a lot of contracts that we've done, and Power is an example where we've kind of carved out the wage rate issue. And we're looking at models that allow us to share that risk with our customer. We will do some of these programs on a fixed-price basis, but we're already down the road on increasing that craft performance or craft amount and understanding what that performance is. And we feel very comfortable about where we are in terms of being able to manage effectively the craft risk, both in terms of wage rate as well as productivity.","Operator","We'll hear our next question from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","David, could you calibrate for us the amount of FEED work that you are working on and bidding currently in 2013 versus what you worked and bid on versus -- in 2012?","David T. Seaton","Oh, it's much more than 2012, both in terms of where we are in the execution of the FEEDs that we brought in, in 2012, as well as the number of new FEEDs that were either negotiations on or in a bidding circumstance with. I think that it's got the opportunity to eclipse the amount of FEED work we did in the 2007, 2008 time frame.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And that should last into 2014, I guess, if the cycle works out as you think?","David T. Seaton","Yes, I mean I think those are going to translate into EPC awards as we get towards the back half of this year and into '14. But these projects are 36-, 48-month kinds of programs, and in some cases, even longer. So the earnings tail goes into '17, '18 on many of these programs.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And my follow-up, David, is moving away but from the U.S., which is quite a bit of interest from investors and such, how does the rest of the world look, some of your opportunities in Middle East, Southeast Asia? Is Australia going through a major pause? Do you see Australia getting things settled if the taxes and the currency issues kind of working its [ph] way out later into the year? Just a sense of how the rest of the world looks and how it's going to impact [indiscernible] who believe they're going to grow business this year?","David T. Seaton","I mean obviously, with 75% our business outside the United States, we've continued to grow outside. And it's kind of across the board. I mean, infrastructure in the Middle East, which is kind of new, phosphate mining. So we've been able to diversify geographically within the -- excuse me, diversify from an industry perspective geographically, if that makes sense. So we've been able to take more projects across the board than I think in our history, which bodes well for I think kind of the sustainable growth model that I think we're in the middle of. The Middle East is obviously a growth area for us. There has been kind of a lull in bidding, but it's going to pick up as we go through this year. Southeast Asia and China are continuing to be positives for us. Australia, I wouldn't say that everybody took a breath. I think BHP was kind of holding off on outer harbor, it was such a big program that it looked like Australia was in decline, but I don't think so, looking at what we're doing with the Oil & Gas guys as well as other mining companies. And BHP has got signs that restarting some of those programs in the [ph] too distant future. Canada is still a big place. A lot of opportunity there in terms of oil sands, pipelines. We feel good about our position there. We feel good about our position in LNG now, with the win in Mozambique for Anadarko and what that -- what does for our ability to compete in that market. So I mean it -- I feel very bullish about things outside the United States. And I think the only limiting factor within the United States is what the regulatory environment is going to be. But I think we're poised to significantly increase the jobs that we would create. And I don't think anybody is going to try to stand in the way of that, particularly when most of these programs that we're working on in the Gulf Coast are on existing facilities that are already permitted for that purpose.","Operator","We'll hear our next question from Andrew Wittman with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","I wanted to just dig in a little bit on the margins on the quarter. Really starting with the federal obviously kind of restructured the LOGCAP benefited the quarter. I'm kind of picturing that's a reversal of what happened in the third quarter, kind of offsetting. But on a go-forward basis, your federal business has kind of been a mid-4 type margin business. Is that kind of the right way to think about the federal business, at least in the near term now, kind of returning to those levels after the restructuring of the LOGCAP contract?","David T. Seaton","I think if you look at -- the way to look at the Government business is more or less looking at it for a full year basis because as you say, there was the fourth quarter pickup offset a third quarter charge. The other anomaly in the year was the loss of the arbitration on Embassy project. So maybe normalize that out, but then beyond that, I think the range [ph] for the year are pretty normal.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Got it. And then just following up on, I guess, Jamie's question earlier on margins and I&I. You can get to the 5% number with some of the announcement backing out the gain for the U.K. JV sale. But you also mentioned in your K that at least in the year, there was about $60 million of closeouts that you booked. I guess my question is how much of that came in the fourth quarter? And maybe -- there's this kind of $19 million, $20 million and $21 million, were the 3 project closeouts. Which one of those were in the fourth quarter, just to give a sense of what maybe the underlying margin was in I&I?","David T. Seaton","One of them would have been, in the fourth quarter, one of the bigger ones. But there's always going to be closeouts. You shouldn't look at a project closing out and saying, oh, that represents some non-recurring source of income. Because if we perform well and if we mitigated risks as we go along and as we get to the end of contracts, we would expect to have a favorable performance. I think that there was maybe a little bit more in the fourth quarter than is typical. But quarter-on-quarter, we're going to have those type of fluctuations.","Biggs C. Porter","I think the other point is those are typically lump sum projects. And the back-end loading of that is by design. So the more we have those infrastructure programs that happened to be lump sum in our portfolio, the more predictable that end game is going to be. I wouldn't say that there was anything that was really unplanned in the quarter. Things happened as we expected, and we were able to release the money associated with certain risks that were no longer risks.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That makes sense. If I might, just one final question here on Greater Gabbard and just want to be clear on this one. The liquidated [ph] damages for $150, that was already part of the write-off, if I'm not mistaken. I just want to clarify that. And then it looks like in the K, you highlighted $100 million of potential for counterclaim. Is that kind of the maximum liability that you're seeing it would be $100 million if it goes against you and nothing more? Just to be clear.","David T. Seaton","It's -- you're correct on the LD. And yes, you're correct on the second question.","Operator","We'll take our next question from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","David, I just want to follow up on your comments relative to the boom you're seeing or hopefully you're seeing in North America. The projects as they start to -- the EPC released in, I guess, hopefully late 2013, 2014, do you expect these to come out as single individual large projects or is it -- in increments? Or I just want to understand how you think this surge in activity plays out and -- for Fluor.","David T. Seaton","Well, I don't think it's going to be one big slug of work that comes out. I think it's going to be phased -- I mean I give you an example. We've already announced the PDH project we're working on for Dow. That's a precursor to the cracker. So I mean, you're just kind of marching upstream there. The same thing is true with the other petrochemical and gas-to-liquids programs that we're working on. Obviously, we've done the majority of the FEED work on those facilities, just talking about the Gulf Coast. So we kind of know where that's going to -- how that's going to work out from a sequencing standpoint. There will be other contractors involved in some of these programs, where they have a specific skill set or expertise. And we will actually be partnering with some on some of these larger programs to take advantage of their skill set. And obviously, some of these things are pretty large. And we want to make sure that we're prudent in how we manage the risks associated with them.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I mean how are the customers in terms of -- I know it's always difficult, but as you start negotiating pricing and terms, are they pretty amenable to cost-plus work for most of this?","David T. Seaton","In some cases, they are. I'd say it's a mixed bag of the -- I'm just talking about Oil & Gas in the Gulf Coast. It's kind of a mixed bag of reimbursable and partial lump sum. As I mentioned, we were -- around the question around craft labor, they recognize that for them to get a lump sum on some of these things, it would be a very large number in order to accept the kind of risks associated with wage rates, as an example. And they're not willing to pay that premium, nor do I think it's prudent for them to do so. So there's -- I would say the negotiation is really what's in the best interest of the asset and the business model that our customer has and what -- and within what timing is this project going to do. I think you're going to see some sequencing just because of the fear of lack of labor, craft labor. I'm not as concerned as others are in that. We know how to do that and do that very well.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And just one quick follow-up. Biggs, how many shares are you assuming in the $3.85 to $4.35 guidance?","Biggs C. Porter","We took the, basically, our year-end share position. And just have to adjust it for anticipated diluted shares above and beyond that. We didn't assume in the EPS guidance any change from additional share repurchases. Not that we won't do them, it's just that we don't incorporate that in.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Sameer Rathod with Macquarie.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","I think there's been a lot of talk about the prospect of ethane crackers. I was wondering if there's a rule of thumb on how much derivative work there could be behind the crackers and what kind of timing -- what will the timing be on that? And also, I was wondering if you had any thoughts on the market for on-purpose olefins ex ethylene in aromatics, and perhaps commenting on Fluor's experience there as well?","David T. Seaton","Well, from an experience standpoint, we've got great experience from soup to nuts down that molecule chain, including aromatics plants. I was actually involved in a very large one in Saudi Arabia back in the '90s. So we do have great capability across that value chain. I'm not sure there's a rule of thumb. When you think about petrochemical manufacturing in the United States, there really hasn't been any investment in that market for, shoot, probably at least 1.5 decades. So you've got new products, you got new capacities, you've got a global supply mix that will shift in this process with I think going further down in that molecule chain, when you start thinking about carbon fibers and the use of those in things like automotive-s and airplanes and everything else. So I think given the economics right now with gas, sub $5, $6, I think you're going to see a significant buildout. But I think it'll be in terms of new crackers up-rating or de-bottlenecking of existing crackers, both of which fall well in our capability. I think you're going to see capacity increases on existing process units, as well as new process units. So it's kind of a mixed bag. But if the economics hold for any period of time, I think you're looking at a pretty significant long-term investment in that market in the United States and the whole shift in where a lot of these projects were shipped. You think it's a world commodity, some of these plastics and fibers. You're going to see more going from the Middle East to Asia and India and less coming to the United States because they're going to be able to provide them here and just the transportation savings alone makes it profitable over the longer term. So I think it's a fundamental shift in petrochemical production right now. And I don't think it will only just be ethane crackers. I think you're probably going to see some naphtha crackers as well.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","Right. How about, I guess, the other olefins like polypropylene or butadiene, I mean given that ethane primarily produces ethylene?","David T. Seaton","Ethylene is not the end game. It's all about polyethylene, polypropylene going further down, MDI, TDI, the fibrous chain. It's pretty holistic. They won't ship ethylene.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","So do you -- I guess my last question, is do you think the derivatives market will be bigger than the first wave of ethane crackers?","David T. Seaton","In terms of number of projects, yes. And I'd say in dollars, it's probably equal to, if not greater.","Sameer Rathod - Macquarie Research","Okay. And the timing would be a few years after the ethylene buildout or would that be concurrent?","David T. Seaton","I think it'll be sequenced. It won't be concurrent, but it won't be when the ethylene is available. You're looking at a balance in those plants. But as I said, I think we're on a pretty sustained growth curve opportunity here, just on the back of shale gas in the United States for the next almost decade. I mean I think it could have that kind of tail on it.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Robert Connors with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","With the petrochemical FEED activity as robust as you've been stating, I was just wondering if -- and as they transition into EPC in the back half of this year and 2014, have -- has Fluor or any of your clients begun to place procurement on some of the longer lead time items that are involved in some of these plants?","David T. Seaton","Well, not only ethylene crackers but obviously the PDH programs we're working on, we're well into the EPC. So in that case, yes. But the big stuff, we're still determining exactly what we need through those FEED programs. So I really don't anticipate large commitments until the back half of this year.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then just on the Global Services margin, it seemed pretty robust but sort of declining sequentially since about the second quarter of this year. I was just wondering if this is the effect of transitioning to, say, more later cycle AMECO type work versus what's probably been some pretty strong O&M network? And if so, where do you think -- or how long do you think such a transition begins to take?","David T. Seaton","Well, on the O&M work, it's been a pretty tough market for the last 4 or 5 years. So obviously that's depressed mark -- margin in that market. But it's a good business, and we're starting to see -- we're actually starting to see customers go back to the old model of picking 2 or 3 really close companies to them and create alliance-style agreements. So we're seeing some of that come back. And with that I think comes a little bit of a margin advantage because they do see the value that, that long-term commitment on both sides has to that equation. AMECO continues to grow. And obviously, that is part of that mix, and that's going to bode well when you start looking at direct-hire construction and the use of our own equipment and the leverage associated with that.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","And just sort of building on that comment, do you think just on strategic alliances outside of O&M, we could see any near-term announcements sort of like the alliances you have with Dow and BASF? Any new announcements?","David T. Seaton","I don't see any coming in the near term.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Will Gabrielski with Lazard.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Biggs, can you talk about the CapEx guidance for '13 and where that's going, and then how you're thinking about '13 from a cash generation standpoint? As maybe that will help us model the buyback from here.","Biggs C. Porter","Sure. In terms of the CapEx guidance, the biggest requirements have been for AMECO. And that is growing because of the additional opportunities we see around the world, including in Mozambique after having made the acquisition there. We think that's a great growth market and great IRR associated with it. So we are funding that. But there's also some internal spend. We have some long-term major office replacements that we're presuming at this point in time we finance internally as opposed to through a lease or some other arrangements. So there's some dollars in there for that. And there's some O&M projects that we considered also in the guidance. The -- in terms of cash flow for the year, this last year, 2012, there was a use of working capital tied to a decrease in advances and also for an increase in the business, so it should grow in revenues. We would expect both those things to continue into 2013. So 2013 cash flow at this point may look a lot like 2012 from an operating cash flow standpoint. But keep in mind that an awful lot of that gets tied up in timing [indiscernible] ebbs and flow, project cash flows. So it's always more meaningful to look at it over a longer period without a cutoff within the year. And that's why we look at it as well in terms of what we do from a capital deployment standpoint. We're not hardcoded on an annual cash flow target, so hopefully that helps. The -- our philosophy with respect to capital deployment remains very much the same in terms of, we obviously want to drive cash flow, want to maintain the A- credit ratings and some flexibility within that. But we'll look for opportunities to invest with a high return and absent those, with $0.16 [ph] of the dividend irrespective and absent those other opportunities, we will look to repurchase shares as excess cash becomes available. Just won't get ahead of it.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","Okay. And not to belabor the point, but in terms of your -- if you look at the mix of backlog right now and where your cash is held, it would seem that there's still a disproportionate weighting internationally in your cash balance. But most of the growth opportunity, it sounds like it's shifting a little bit back towards North America. How does that play into how you think about that overseas cash?","David T. Seaton","You're right. Over time, we expect higher or a shift back, as you say, of the total backlog to the U.S. although we expect substantial growth internationally as well. So we'll see how it plays out from a percentage standpoint as we go through time. Right now, there is $1.7 billion -- or at the end of the year, $1.7 billion of our $2.6 billion total cash was international, so a lot of it overseas. As the U.S. cash balance grows, certainly it becomes more efficient to use that domestically for whatever purpose. But the most important thing is you get the cash generation irrespective of whether it's domestic or international, and that gives us the biggest opportunity.","Biggs C. Porter","Well, I want to just put a point on one thing you mentioned, and that is even though we do see a significant opportunity in the United States, I still see the majority of our business being outside the United States for some time to come.","Will Gabrielski - Lazard Capital Markets LLC, Research Division","No, I hear you. Just in terms of the weighting of backlog maybe shifting a little bit back towards North America. Just one last question, David, if you don't mind. On the Power business, can you just give an update on the Dominion project and how maybe that's progressing towards financial closure or not? And then just broadly speaking within Power, what your expectation for the year is from an award standpoint and then visibility beyond that?","David T. Seaton","I think new awards in Power, I'm modestly optimistic. I mean, I think there's some things that have to go forward relative to gas and some of the renewables. I don't think it will be prudent for me to comment on Dominion.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Just a quick follow-up. Can you just talk about how you expect your Afghanistan work to ramp down over the next couple of years? I'm just wondering based on troop counts, do you think you could run off half by the end of 2013 and then maybe the other half by the end of '14? Or I think maybe last quarter, you'd say that there'll be a pickup before it winds down.","David T. Seaton","That's a great question. I think we're doing all the scenarios that the military has asked us to do on the back of LOGCAP. I think what typically happens in a drawdown is the services that the military is doing has to still be done when there's military in theater, and that's when they turn to us. So you actually see a little bit of a rise in our activities as you go through a drawdown. We have not gotten anything other than the things you've heard in the press that would suggest that you are going to see a significant drawdown in '13. But as we anticipated, '14 will be when we start to see that come down. But I don't think it's going to be appreciably different in '13 than it was in '12.","Okay. I guess we're to the end of the questions. And thank you, operator, for handling that for us. And thanks to everyone for participating on our call today.","As we've said, we believe the underlying performance of the company in 2012 was extremely strong. During the year, we returned over $500 million in cash to shareholders through dividends and the repurchase of 7.74 [ph] million shares. And we continue to maintain one of the healthiest cash positions in the industry.","Looking at 2013, we're very optimistic about the opportunities, as you've heard us speak. We see opportunities across the industries and geographies that we work in, primarily Oil & Gas and petrochemicals and infrastructure I think in the near term. And we expect to see deliver solid results in line with our guidance.","With that, we really appreciate your interest in our company as well as the confidence you have in us. So thank you, and everyone, have a great day.","Operator","This does concludes today's conference.

The passcode of 9590125 will be required.","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Ken Lockwood, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Lockwood.","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thanks very much, operator, and welcome, everyone, to Fluor's First Quarter 2014 Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after the market closed, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making our prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which we've summarized on Slide 2.","During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in the company's Form 10-Q, which was also filed earlier today.","During today's call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures, and reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are also posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","With that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. Please go ahead, David.","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, and thanks for joining us. On today's call, we'll review our results for the first quarter and discuss our outlook for the remainder of 2014.","If you'll turn to Slide 3, I want to start by covering some of the highlights from our first quarter. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the quarter were $149 million or $0.92 per diluted share, which compares with $166 million or $1.02 per share, the diluted share a year ago. This is consistent with our expectations and previous guidance for lower earnings in the early part of the year, followed by a ramp-up in the second half of '14 and into 2015.","Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $268 million, which compares to $294 million in the first quarter of 2013. Segment profit results were driven by a 32% increase in Oil & Gas profit, offset by lower contributions from the company's other segments, which as we have discussed, are experiencing varying degrees of market challenges.","Consolidated revenue for the quarter was lower than expected at $5.4 billion, down from $7.2 billion a year ago, again, mainly due to significantly lower revenues in the Mining & Metals business line.","We are very pleased with our new awards for the quarter, which were a record $10.7 billion. New awards were primarily driven by Oil & Gas orders of $8.8 billion, while Industrial & Infrastructure booked $924 million, and our Government Group booked $748 million.","Consolidated backlog at the quarter end rose to $40.2 billion, up $5.3 billion over last quarter and up from $37.5 billion a year ago. Our financial results are summarized on the next slide in the table, and I'll continue my remarks on Slide 5.","In the first quarter, the Oil & Gas segment booked, as I said, the new award number of $8.8 billion, which included a portion of the engineering procurement and construction on an LNG project in Canada; as well as a major clean fuels refinery program in Kuwait; a refinery expansion in Canada; a pipeline project in Mexico; and a chemicals project in Malaysia. Ending backlog for the Oil & Gas segment rose 38% from a year ago and now sits at $25.7 billion, the fifth sequential quarterly increase.","Turning to Slide 6, the Industrial & Infrastructure new awards were just under $1 billion, including additional scope on a copper project in Peru and an iron ore facility in Australia. Backlog at the end of the quarter was $9.9 billion, down from $16 billion a year ago. This decline was driven by the Mining & Metals business line, which was impacted by lower awards and a project cancellation in 2013. In infrastructure, opportunities continue to evolve, and we are tracking a number of road and rail projects that are expected to be awarded later this year.","If you turn to Slide 7, the Government Group posted new awards for the quarter of $748 million, including a 5-year contract to maintain United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve with the Department of Energy. This is a great win for the group as they focus on expanding their service businesses. Ending backlog was up -- excuse me, was $2.6 billion, up from $2.4 billion last quarter.","I'm also pleased to report that last month, we were informed that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority in the United Kingdom selected the Cavendish Fluor partnership as the preferred bidder on Magnox for the decommissioning of 12 nuclear sites. This project will leverage our considerable experience in nuclear remediation.","In the Power segment, new awards were $166 million, and ending backlog was $1.9 billion, comparable with the $1.9 billion a year ago. Although the market is very competitive, we're bidding a number of gas-fired power generation facilities and expect awards over the next few quarters. Although book and burn from these projects would be light in the current year, the number of opportunities is important to our prospects for growth in Power in 2015.","In other Power-related news, I want to provide a brief update on NuScale. As you know, the DOE selected NuScale for the second round of FOA funding. We're in the process of working towards financial close with the DOE, which will be a key step in attracting potential investors, manufacturers and other supply chain partners.","With that, I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 8 of the presentation. I want to start by providing some additional comments on our performance for the first quarter. As David mentioned, revenue for the first quarter was down fairly significantly year-over-year, mainly due to the continued falloff in Mining activity.","Revenue was also down from last quarter, mainly due to Mining, but we also saw a modest reduction in Oil & Gas. This reduction is a reflection of a change in the mix of the work there, with a larger FEED and engineering content as compared to construction. This mix change had a favorable impact on Oil & Gas margins in the quarter. We expect construction work on a number of large Oil & Gas projects to pick up later in the year once engineering work has progressed.","Corporate G&A expense for the first quarter were $38 million, up from $33 million a year ago. The majority of this increase can be attributed to higher compensation expenses.","The effective tax rate in the first quarter was approximately 29%, including a positive effect for deferred tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions. We expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be between 32% to 33%.","Shifting to the balance sheet on Slide 9, Fluor's financial condition remains very strong, with cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaling $2.6 billion. This compares with the balance of $2.5 billion a year ago.","During the quarter, the company generated $187 million in cash flow from operating activities and repurchased approximately $200 million worth of Fluor shares. Consistent with our announcement late last year, we retired about $400 million worth of shares over the past 2 quarters.","The cash balance did not otherwise decline seasonally as much in the first quarter of 2014 as in prior years, primarily due to the timing of cash flows between March and April. In the first quarter, we also paid $26 million in dividends.","Moving to Slide 10, as previously mentioned, Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $40.2 billion. The percentage of fixed-price contracts in our overall backlog remained at 20%. And the mix by geography was 32% U.S. and 68% non-U.S.","I will conclude my remarks by providing an update on our 2014 guidance, which is on Slide 11. As evidenced by the strong booking in the quarter, we are well-positioned for earnings growth, which we expect to start in the second half of the year and then continue into 2015. Reduction of revenue from the Mining and Government businesses will remain an offset to growth in Oil & Gas through the second quarter.","Outside of Oil & Gas, new awards for the first half are not expected to drive enough book and burn to support the high end of our initial guidance range for the year. For this reason, we have lowered the top end of our guidance by $0.15 to a range of $4.10 to $4.45 per share. We now expect overall revenue will be lower in 2014 than in 2013, but offset in part by higher margin. This adjustment to our guidance does not diminish our optimism for the mid or longer term.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","David, looking at the non-Oil & Gas businesses in your portfolio, how close are we for a turn in new business opportunities to allow 2015 performance to be a better contributor and certainly this kind of bottoming phase in 2014? And of those businesses, which ones are more likely to drive it versus others?","David T. Seaton","Well, as we talked, Michael, it's a great question. As we talked, there's a lot of headwind in Mining and in Government, specifically around the LOGCAP project. And it will certainly close as we get into '15 and probably beyond because I think there'll be people there that -- beyond in Afghanistan. But I think that what we're seeing right now is we're seeing a good solid stream of study in front-end work in Mining, which gives me confidence that we'll see that start to return as we get into '15. I think government's going to be more of a difficulty. They've got a lot of things on the books. I mean, I think winning the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a great example of the diversity within that group of being able to not only work in the DOD world, but also in the DOE world and the FEMA world. So that diversity helps them, but I think it's going to be difficult to replace LOGCAP from its peak. Infrastructure, I think is -- as I said in the prepared remarks, we've got several projects that we're bidding right now, and we feel pretty good about. And then I think Power, I mean, one of the things that's in front of us, as we've said in previous calls and certainly in this call, there's a lot of combined cycle gas-fired power plants that we're bidding. I think we -- I think there's 7 of them that we're in bid right now. But I think that the recent ruling by the Supreme Court on CSAPR really helps us because we've got a lot of expertise on the coal side of the Power business, on the retrofit side. And I think that, that ruling by the Supreme Court really helps us a lot when we think about removing some of the headwinds that Power has experienced over the last 2 years.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","I appreciate that, David. And my follow-up question, as you -- or maybe for Biggs, as you look towards 2014 and capital allocation, any major changes to capital spending, working capital adjustments? And will share or repurchases be opportunistic or more measured throughout 2014, all things else considered?","Biggs C. Porter","In terms of -- well, no real change in perspectives or philosophies on CapEx; may well run fairly consistent with last year. As noted, the Global Services group, which contains the equipment business, is not off to a fast start this year, so correspondingly, CapEx is staying modest through this particular point in time. We hope that there's opportunity -- there are opportunities for that growth going forward. But I would expect overall CapEx may be in line with last year. From the standpoint of working capital, normally, you associate this particularly with revenues. So with revenue expected to be somewhat down now, we actually don't expect much change in working capital over the course of the year, so cash generation from earnings should be strong. And then, in terms of share repurchases, the -- as I said, no change. We've executed the $200 million in the first quarter, which brought us to the $400 million cumulatively over the last couple of quarters. And our philosophy going from here remains the same. It's a matter of consistently measuring what amount of cash we think is an excess of requirements, evaluating whether or not there's some higher-return opportunity for that and the absence, and as we build through time of some greater investment opportunity, then we would look to repurchase shares, which I think has been pretty consistent with our practices over the last few years.","Operator","Our next question is from Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. I'm so sorry, it's\u2026","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess 2 questions. First, on the top line, David, the Oil & Gas revenues were weaker than I would have thought. They came down sequentially. Is there anything going on there? At what point do you expect the Oil & Gas revenues to ramp more dramatically? And my second question is, I guess, just back on the guidance. I understand the headwinds that you faced, but you've booked a huge amount of bookings. The Oil & Gas margins in the quarter were 5.1%, which is sort of where you targeted it at the year-end. So I guess my question is, do we get to a point where these underperforming businesses are small enough and Oil & Gas is big enough that you can finally grow the EPS double digit and when do we get there? And is the 5.1% -- I guess, the other concern or bear case would be, the 5.1% margin is a peak margin in your Oil & Gas and so your total backlog as at peak, so how do you think about that?","David T. Seaton","The first thing, it is a mix issue. I mean, you're going basically from -- I think everybody kind of thinks about Oil & Gas as the only thing we have, but we have a pretty robust diversity that we deal with. And when you look at how big Mining was 2 years ago, and that's a significant drop-off. So from a revenue perspective, I'm not too concerned about the drop this year, as long as the profitably is there, which we have. So I think what you're doing is you're -- not only are you changing from a Mining -- predominantly Mining revenue burn and associated margin to Oil & Gas and its associated margin, we're also facing kind of the shift in the project cycle from the full EPC back to in E&C -- within the Oil & Gas segment, that beginning FEED and first pieces of engineering, where you're not burning the revenues associated with the procurement cycle or the construction cycle. So that is what we expected to happen. It's a little bit more of a drop than I think we had hoped for. But again, I think when you look at the profitability, I feel pretty good about where we are. I am...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So when is that inflection point?","David T. Seaton","Sorry?","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","When is that inflection point when your earnings finally start to grow double-digit and reflect the Oil & Gas backlog in the margin? And have margins in Oil & Gas peaked and in backlog peaked?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'm not going to give you the specific date. I mean, I think what we've said in the past is the first 2 quarters are light on EPS, and it grows towards the end of the year. As Biggs said, we didn't see an avenue right now to get to the top end of the range, and that's why we dropped it. I think that E&C being back above 5% is a good thing. We think that it'll -- it may drop a little bit, it may rise a little bit, but I think we're back into kind of the sweet spot of E&C. And as I've answered the question to Michael, if you get towards the end of this year and into next year, if we have some success in Power and in Mining on the back of some of these front ends we're doing, we should start to see revenue growth, as well as profitability growth.","Biggs C. Porter","I also should note that we expect the other businesses besides Oil & Gas generally to have improving bottom line results as we go through the year this year. And worth coming back and referring to the Power projects; there's a number of bids, more than we have had in the last couple of years, outstanding on Power projects. We obviously knew those projects were going to be out there for bid. But what's happened is, that the decision processes on those by the customer has moved out to the right. So it's just less likely to have as much benefit from those this year. There would be benefit from them, and it would create opportunity for growth, but not as much this year and more for next year. So I don't think it's fair to look at all the other businesses besides Oil & Gas and portray those as shrinking businesses. The first quarter is certainly a low point for the most of them.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. I appreciate that. And then, just on the Oil & Gas revenues in the quarter, was that below your expectations or was my modeling correct? I'm just trying to figure out when that ramps, and I'll get back in queue.","David T. Seaton","It was a little bit below, but I'd say it was in line with what we thought, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. And that should start to ramp?","David T. Seaton","Yes.","Operator","Our next question is from Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","David, could you expand a little bit upon some of the bidding opportunities in Oil & Gas? And if you don't want to be specific on project, maybe talk geographic, where they stand and\/or kind of what type of facility they could be, such as pipelines in Mexico, that sort of thing?","David T. Seaton","Yes, I think the U.S. still has some growth in front of us. I mean, there's several projects in the Gulf Coast that we're continuing to pursue, both through FID and also new bids. Obviously, there's 2 more -- or excuse me, 2 more LNG plants in the Gulf Coast that we're pursuing very diligently. Canada still holds out a lot of opportunity in terms of pipelines and SAGD-type projects in the oil sands. If you go to Europe, oddly enough, there's some refinery work that we're pursuing that we feel really, really good about. In Africa, Mozambique and South Africa to continue to be -- I wouldn't -- I mean, Mozambique's kind of an anomaly, and there's just some huge projects there. But I think the Middle East still has a lot to hold, both in terms of offshore upstream and more refining work that's coming, in addition to some of the petrochemical stuff that we're pursuing. In Southeast Asia, a lot of work in petrochemicals that we're pursuing, Malaysia specifically in 2 different cases. And then I think in China, when you think about some of the partnerships that we've announced previously, and one that comes to mind is BASF in China and Malaysia as well as United States. So I think it's a pretty robust bid slate for us or prospect slate for us, and I'm really pleased to say that it's very geographically dispersed.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","And were there any onetime items in the quarter that were somewhat material that weren't necessarily called out in the press release, i.e., onetime gains, anything like that?","David T. Seaton","No.","Operator","Our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David or Biggs, when you lowered the high end of your guidance, was it more because your I&I revenue continues to be lower than expectation or was it because Government was a little weaker or is a little weaker and Global Services continues to be a bit of a drag? I'm just trying to figure out, is it all of the above? Is it one more than the other? And maybe you could talk about Global Services in particular because that segment continues to sort of maybe slow down a little bit.","Biggs C. Porter","Let me kind of hit the last point first, and I'll come back. So on Global Services, they have -- the biggest income driver there is the equipment business, which is correlated to a fair degree to work in Afghanistan and to work on Mining. And so some of the movement there is consistent with what you see in the other business segments. They also, though, support construction and will support our own construction activities. So as that ramps up, it creates more opportunity for them, so somewhat consistent with the notion that we have a lot of engineering content in the quarter. We correspondingly had less constructions or less opportunity for the equipment business. So they do have an opportunity. They'll have some pressures from Mining and Afghanistan as we go through the year, but then they have opportunity associated with the other activities. Broadly speaking, in terms of the high end of the range, it really is a matter of we expect improvement as we always did through the course of the year, but as I said, we aren't getting enough activity on the new awards side. Things have slid to the right, new project proposals on the Government side, the Power proposals on the -- for the gas plants, a number of them, but they've shifted to the right in terms of their timing of award. And so that just means that our ability to have that much greater acceleration to our growth as we go through the year has become limited because we just can't get those awards in. Assuming we win our fair share as targeted, we just can't get them in fast enough to create enough book and burn to have that additional acceleration through the second half of the year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","And should we see I&I revenues stabilize here or does it still have a little more downside to it?","Biggs C. Porter","I think overall, it could actually be growing from here. It's going to bounce around because you've got offsets between infrastructure projects, and as they mature, like the Tappan Zee Bridge and what's happening on the Mining business, which is approaching a point of some stabilization. Depends on future awards on Mining, is it stable at this point or not, but I think that it does have opportunity to grow.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, you know someone's going to ask you about NuScale, so it might as well be me. So you know what your competitor has been doing or the other guy who's got the technology and sort of downsizing there or slowing down their spending. You've talked about slowing down your spending in NuScale in the second half of the year, at least having the DOE pick up the slack. So can you give us an update on that? I mean, you did, I think, $13 million in spend in the quarter. Can we see that drop in the second half of the year and what's in the guidance?","David T. Seaton","I think we're still negotiating that FOA, and I think our expectation is to spend prudently based on what progress we need to make to move towards the certification. Whether it's $13 million or a little bit more or a little bit less, I think the issue is we're actively looking for additional investors. This has always been our plan. The finalization of the deal with the DOE helps us get there. There's been lots of discussion with different potential investors that show interest. But I think they're all, again, still waiting on, on signing the deal. I'm not going to cover anything about the other technologies. I still have great confidence in the technology and its application. I think the size of the reactors and its application is more widespread than maybe some of the other technologies. And I think it's got safety features that are much better than the other technologies. So I think we're steady as she goes relative to our investment. And I feel really good about the position where we sit and the conversations that are going on with strategic partners that would also begin to take part of that spend curve.","Biggs C. Porter","This is Biggs. Just to elaborate a little bit. Consistent with what we said before, what happens under the FOA arrangement is actually that our gross spend goes up. There will be an increase in the gross spend, but that increase will be offset by the funding from the government such that at the end of the day, roughly speaking, this year's net P&L expense would be roughly equal to last year's. So higher spend offset by government funding producing about the same bottom line effect, all other things, EG ownership staying equal. If we succeed in selling some of the interest, then there's opportunity for it to go down, that P&L expense.","Operator","We'll hear next from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, can you talk about the timing of the final investment decisions on the next round of U.S. ethylene and LNG projects? I guess if you could touch on Sasol and Lake Charles specifically? And then, in the past, you mentioned that you folks were full when it comes to ethylene and you weren't planning on bidding on any more projects. I'm wondering has that thought process changed at all? And -- or just your updated thoughts there would be helpful.","David T. Seaton","Well, I never said we weren't going to bid on more ethylene plants if they come. I think we're moving towards FID decision on Sasol in the second half of the year, probably towards the end of the third quarter. Probably won't know until the beginning of the fourth. On LNG, as we stated, there's a portion of Kitimat in the new awards, FID is later in the year, so there's probably another part of an award towards next year. The 2 LNG plants that I mentioned in the Gulf Coast, it's early stages, so my guess is we're probably talking about an award sometime mid-next year. With regard to Mozambique, they're still looking to down-select, if not award, to one contractor sometime towards the end of this year. But I think that's a 2015 award. But there's -- I think the beauty of what we've seen is the awards for this quarter were significant in sheer numbers of awards in a couple of hundred -- 240 or 250 awards in the quarter, which is pretty robust. And a lot of that is front end. So when I think about the conversation on the non-Oil & Gas business, there's a fair amount of capital spending decisions that'll take place towards the beginning of next year, which I think just helps us grow the business in '15, '16 and beyond. So I think, as I've said in the past, we're kind of in the early stages of a pretty sustainable robust growth period. And I think Biggs said it right, I mean, I think Mining's, if not close -- if not stable, is close, and hence, I&I should grow from there. So it's a pretty good story across the board, with still a couple of headwinds in government, the headwind of timing around when the growth in Mining takes place. And then obviously, we're in the early innings of a pretty long baseball game in Oil & Gas.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And then, David, in U.S. infrastructure, can you just talk about the inquiry or the bid pipeline, how that developed over the past quarter? The bid opportunities that you highlighted for I&I, was that in the U.S. or elsewhere?","David T. Seaton","It was mostly in the U.S., a couple things in Europe, but primarily in the U.S. And I think one of the things that the U.S. Government's doing, or at least moving down the road in a very positive way, is some of the legislation around U.S. infrastructure, which only helps that.","Operator","Mr. Wittmann, your line is open.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Biggs, it looked like in the Q that there was some closeouts that were unquantified in I&I. Do you have that number handy, by any chance?","Biggs C. Porter","I don't think -- it's a number that, individually, is material and makes sense to call out. There were 2 things in I&I. There were some closeouts and some incentives on the mining side. And then we also had favorable performance on an infrastructure project, which had an increase in its booking rate. And that's what drove the margin rate up to 6% in the quarter, as opposed to what's more normally between 4% and 5%. So that gives you an idea of the magnitude of the favorable effects there.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Yes. Recently, it's been running closer to the 4% than the 5%. Do you expect that to be the case for the balance of the year?","Biggs C. Porter","I think it's early to call it. I don't want to get too specific. I think you have to just take the 4% to 5% range. It always is going to vary some quarter-to-quarter, based upon milestones on projects and mix. But the -- as you look at it on a broad basis on a longer term, with mining revenues down year-over-year, that's lower-margin business. Infrastructure is higher-margin business. So that creates a bit of a shift, all other things equal. The only caution we'd make to that for people trying to compare it to last year was there were a number of projects on infrastructure last year which did even better than the normal margin rate, because we hit so many of the milestones successfully. And we don't see quite as much opportunity for that this year. It's hard to get more specific than that -- or it's not hard, but I don't think it makes sense to. But that should give you a reasonable range to deal with.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That's helpful. And maybe, David, on the Government business, margins were kind of light. Is that due to the shrinking business and maybe having some under-absorption of any labor costs there? And can you rectify that by getting ahead with the right staffing levels? Or should we think of that business kind of being structurally here with this level of work in that segment?","Biggs C. Porter","This is Biggs. I'll answer the question a little bit, and David can add on. But a couple things in the Government business, and it's also evidence in -- evident in some of their business the last few quarters, where there's been a lot of proposal activity. There is a little higher overhead associated with proposal activity. We don't have all the new awards in it, as I said earlier, that we would have targeted by this point in time. But certainly, the Magnox award is pretty big. And so that's had an effect on G&A and Government and in Power, for that matter, the level of bidding activity that's been taking place the last couple of quarters. There also was underperformance on one project in there, which created a little bit of a negative noise for them. It wasn't material in the broader scheme of things, but if you're looking at it just from the standpoint of Government, it held them back a little bit. And that's one reason why I'd say they've got opportunity to grow from here.","David T. Seaton","Yes, I'd just add a little bit of color on that. I think I'm really proud of what they've been able to do when you think of winning Magnox and the petroleum reserve. So they're in the process of trying to figure out how they stem the tide of decline from what was a huge program in LOGCAP, with new work in other parts of the Government infrastructure. But I think the win in the U.K. was huge for us because it takes us out of just relying on the U.S. from a market perspective.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","That makes sense. Is there any risk that the Magnox -- you're the preferred bidder, I know it's been protested. Can you, one, talk about the -- I mean, is that yours? How should investors think about that? Can you just talk about the economics of that joint venture? I think you're a minority partner. Is that proportionally consolidated? And what do you think the scope could be for that Magnox project? Any color would be helpful.","David T. Seaton","It is, proportionally.","Biggs C. Porter","Well, we haven't -- yes. We haven't put anything in the backlog the first quarter because this is a second quarter award. If we do, it will be on a proportion and consolidated. When I say, if we do it, we're still examining whether it should be properly accounted for on an equity method or a proportion-consolidated method. But it would be 1 of those 2, and it would follow-on in the second quarter.","David T. Seaton","And the protest rules are different in the U.S. than they are -- in the U.K. than they are in the U.S. And then we wouldn't have announced it had we not signed the document with the government.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is really in regards to Oil & Gas. I think Jamie asked some of these questions. But I thought if you're looking at 2015, how much -- when you're looking at growth in 2015, how much as of right now do you think is really dependent on a lot of what you've booked really moving forward versus really incrementally booking more stuff that contributes to 2015, let's say, even by the end of the year when we're looking at some of the larger bookings you've had?","David T. Seaton","We never book enough, Tahira. No, I think, obviously, with what -- with the success we've had, we have better vision into the last half of this year and into '15 than we normally would have at this juncture. Obviously, we've got to have things like Sasol go past FID. We've got to continue to win the work that's in front of us and the bids that are in front of us to continue that growth curve. But I think, by and large, we feel pretty good about where we are in Oil & Gas in the cycle and the prospects for continuing to grow that business as we go through this year and into '15. And the obvious question is, going back to some of the previous comments, where are we in Mining? What do we do in Power? And how well does government kind of stem the tide of decline associated with LOGCAP? But I think, relative to E&C, we feel very good. I think the team has done a very good job of securing those awards that move our needle. And as I said in another response, there's still a pretty robust prospect slate in front of us through the next, probably, 6 quarters that will help us continue to pile on, on that growth curve.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. And as a second question, if you look at the Power segment, clearly, it's been having a bit of a challenging time. If you do start to see some of these retrofit projects and also the Power projects on the gas side holds true, could potentially the volumes be sufficient to really have something profitable? Is your utilization is so low there that you don't really need pricing, you just need volume at this point for next year?","David T. Seaton","Well, we don't need volume, we need profitable projects. And that's really what we're focused on. But I think, on the retrofit side, we did a lot of work, a lot of study work, going back 2 years ago, in helping many of our customers look at what their options are, assuming that the CSAPR rules went into play. So we know kind of what's in front of us and we're really happy with the ruling, let's put it that way. I think the challenge is going to be -- I think the power companies were kind of thinking we probably will get a different response from the Supreme Court. So I think we got to do a little rationalization right now with our customers, help them figure out exactly what that mix is going to be. But I think you're going to see a significant amount of work come out of that. The coal fleet needs help, everybody knows that. And the power companies are ready to spend money prudently to deal with that generating capacity. So I think as we -- again, as I've said, I think as we get into next year, I see an opportunity for growth in the Power segment.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","David, when you mention prospects for bookings over the next 6 quarters, I assume that's just your -- how far out your visibility is. But...","David T. Seaton","That's correct.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","The last 2 years, we've seen backlog peak early in the year and then kind of run off through the year. And I know it's hard to say when projects are going to come in, but are we looking at the same pattern this year, and any way to tell?","David T. Seaton","I'd say -- I want to invoke the lumpy word again. I mean, obviously, we had a great quarter. And that does take us back above the $40 billion, and that's been one of the statements and questions that you guys have asked us is when -- can you get it back over $40 billion. Well, the answer is yes. But I think, given what we see, it could decline some during this year. But I would expect our ending backlog for the year to end with a -- or start with a 4.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. And I'd love to hear by sector, but in general, is the embedded margins in the backlog or the embedded profits, as you look at it now, is it growing in line with the overall backlog growth?","David T. Seaton","The margin in backlog is improving and growing, I think, in line with the backlog. But again, as Biggs has said, and he can comment on this, it's -- there's a lot of moving parts in that backlog, but I think, generally, we're headed in an orderly direction over the longer term.","Biggs C. Porter","Yes. So certainly, margin dollars are growing with backlog. But I think it's important to keep perspective here to what we said over several quarters, was even though backlog was declining, margin rate was going up due to mix. And in fact, in many quarters, even though revenue in backlog was declining, the margin dollars, in total, were going up. Now, with backlog going up, you've got a combination of both. You've got both higher margin rate and margin dollars going up.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Okay. So, as you move from the design and upfront phase into actual construction services, I mean there's not going to be a dramatic shift, especially in the oil and gas sector in terms of margin?","Biggs C. Porter","There will be moves -- movement in our actual booking rates -- in our profit margin rates in the P&L, as there always are with various mix change stages with stages on projects and customer furnished or higher engineering content-type of work, or construction work. All those things create some amount of variability. The first quarter, obviously, it drove the P&L margin rate on Oil & Gas up to above 5%. But when you talk about backlog, we don't publish the numbers, so you don't see it, but generally speaking, we don't expect big shifts to be occurring any kind of a short-term basis. So there's not that much I can say. Obviously, there's so many moving parts, it's hard to generalize and hard to give guidance, which is really going to be meaningful because you'll always have certain amount of volatility.","Operator","Now we'll hear next from Tate Sullivan with CLSA.","Tate Sullivan - CLSA Limited, Research Division","Great order quarter with the $10.7 billion. But I mean it sounds very confident for the order outlook in general, but can you just give some context to do you think you could exceed this quarterly number in orders?","David T. Seaton","Well, it is a record. I think the answer is yes. I don't see it this year, but -- again, this year. But we've done a couple of $9 billion quarters in the past. But the projects are getting larger and I think the markets are such that our offering is something our customers are looking for. So I think it'll be difficult in the near term, but yes, I think we could hit another $10 billion quarter.","Tate Sullivan - CLSA Limited, Research Division","And last one for me, and you've talked a lot about it, but this -- can you quantify the scale of the opportunity, the order opportunity with the 7 bids for gas-fired plants, to put some context around it?","David T. Seaton","I would say they're, in totality, somewhere in the neighborhood of $2 billion, $1.7 billion to $2 billion in revenue -- new order revenue.","Operator","Next we'll hear from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Can you just provide some more color on Mining? You said that you could potentially see some improvement in that business. How many projects are you tracking? And also, would you be seeing any changes in the margin structure of any future mining work?","David T. Seaton","Probably no difference in how we approach that business. But we have Cerro Verde and Pueblo Viejo going on right now in the fields. So it's not like it completely dried up. But there's a fair amount of FEED work going on that supports the South American market. But I also think that there's a fair -- I know there's a fair amount of work that's being discussed around Australia again. I think that if you look at the Mining sector, in general, the new management's had enough time to rationalize what their spending's going to be. I think they've done a good job of returning capital to the shareholders. But really, I think what we're looking for is a change in the commodity pricing. We're not too far off of the commodity price, in some things like gold and copper, to where the investment decisions are made. But right now, I think we're helping them rationalize some of those assets and look at where they want to monetize their natural resource. We've got great relationships in that market. And when the spending starts to return on an EPC basis, I think we'll be there in a pretty strong position.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's helpful. And then just on the service business, you mentioned one of the drivers for lower service margins was the reduction in equipment business. I mean, is this the new run rate for the service business, given the pull back in Mining in the near term?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think it probably -- it's probably close. I think we do have some growth opportunities. But when you look at the equipment business, the 2 biggest pieces, as Biggs said, was mining in Afghanistan. Not only the Fluor piece of Afghanistan, but also the DynCorp piece of Afghanistan. So they've got -- they're just like the Government Group where they've had a pretty huge revenue base that's eroded significantly and rebuilding that is going to be on the back of growth. But it's also going to rebuild itself on the back of some of the direct-hire construction that we're doing in Oil & Gas. So I think that there is growth opportunities there, but I think it's a timing element more than anything else.","Operator","Our next question is from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","I just want to gauge your confidence in the new guidance range for this year. I guess, specifically, how concerned are you that these Oil & Gas projects could get stuck in the FEED phase?","David T. Seaton","So you're looking for guidance within the guidance?","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Well, no. I mean I know you said the most important thing is to get these projects going. But I feel like we hear a lot about your customers just kind of go back and forth and keep rehashing over the FEEDs. And just kind of wondering, from your perspective, what that risk is, or you can give guidance within the guidance.","David T. Seaton","I think you've got to go back to when we established the range, which was at the end of the third quarter. And obviously, some things have slowed down and some decisions have been delayed. I think Kitimat's a great example of that, where we thought it would be awarded in the third quarter and then it was awarded in the first quarter, or at least the portion that we took in. So I think that explains a lot of why we've reduced the top end. But I would suggest we're pretty confident in the range that we stand at today.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I guess since you mentioned Kitimat, I'll use that as my follow-up. So for the amount that you put in backlog for that project, are you fully authorized to proceed on that work?","David T. Seaton","We are -- we don't talk -- go back to the Chevron rules, we don't talk about numbers in terms of total or in terms of what pieces we've done. We're confident in the work scope that is associated with what we took in the backlog.","Operator","We'll hear next from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","So, Dave, actually, I thought your comments about the power retrofit market actually were really interesting. Just -- are you getting the sense that a lot of utilities were holding back on spending, not just only on cash, but also the naturals until they were getting clarity and there had been kind of a building opportunity that might just be beyond just what's required for cash for itself? And I don't know if you have -- you could potentially even quantify how big you think the market is and maybe how many years you could see orders kind of emerge through that from the utilities.","David T. Seaton","I think you bring up a good point and I think your comment is correct. I think there's a pent-up demand due to waiting on regulation. You think about it, the U.S. generating capacity, I think 60s -- over 60% is based on coal. One of the things I like to talk about is everybody on this call walks in, flips the light switch on, lights come on, they plug in their phone, they don't even think about what's their power bill is. So it's about affordable energy. And right now, clean coal is available, clean coal technologies. Even at the cost of cleaning up some of the back end, it's still cheaper than some of the other sources. So I think there's an element of the market saying, \"Let's wait, for sure, and let's see what we can put into our business models and what those business models produce as far as what affordable energy would be.\" I think it's a long answer or a long period of time for this. And I go back to something that was -- I was on a panel with Jim Rodgers back, I don't know, this is probably 4 years ago, when they were talking about the rules. At that time, he said that Duke was ready to spend $20 billion on cleaning up their coal fleet if they had surety of regulation. So I think that -- I'd stick with what he said as part of the answer for how big it could be and how long-term I think that market will be. I think it's a pretty interesting market. We're very well-positioned to capture a large share of that. And I think that helps that -- it helps that confidence in the growth story over the longer term that I've been talking about.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Got it. And just secondly, just on LOGCAP, I mean, is that contract to you winding down faster than you anticipated? And I think you were looking for about $1 billion run rate as you exited the year. Do you think that is the likely maintenance level for the next couple of years? Or is there a big step down coming maybe in '15 and '16?","David T. Seaton","Well we're in line with what we thought. I think it will be a step down as you get into '15, '16. But again, it depends on the elections that are taking place right now in Afghanistan and what agreements are made with the U.S. Government. So we know it'll be less than right now, but we don't know how much less.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Okay. If I could just ask one more, just on Oil & Gas. So, Biggs, you were just mentioning there's quite -- actually it may have been David, quite a bit of FEED work actually has been booked just recently. And you're expecting construction to start winding up again in the second half of the year. But just given, I guess, the increased portion of the revenue being recognized in that FEED stage, I mean, should we be thinking that margins are hovering around that $5 -- excuse me, that 5% level for the remainder of the year?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, obviously, it depends upon mix and a variety of things. And we don't want to get too specific, but I guess I wouldn't be surprised to see them drop down a little bit and then come back up. We originally had forecasted being at 5% by the end of the year in our prior commentary. We got there early on mix, but if the mix moves back a little bit the other direction here next couple quarters, it could come back down and come back up later. But either way, it's well-positioned for additional growth over the longer term as volumes go up and as the mix continues to shift and this -- the leverage of overheads continues to improve.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I'll turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David T. Seaton","Thank you, operator, and thanks to all of you for participating on the call today. We appreciate your interest in our company.","As we discussed I think over the course of today's call, we continue to be very positive in our view of our Oil & Gas business, both in terms of the strength of their recent performance, but also because of the strong ongoing prospects that we're pursuing.","While we continue to experience some headwinds in Mining and Government, as we've discussed today, we view those as temporary conditions that will remedy themselves over time.","With that, our enthusiasm for growth into '15 and beyond is not diminished.","With that, we greatly appreciate your interest in our company and your confidence, and we wish you a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's conference.

Please go ahead, Mr. Telfer.","Geoff Telfer - Vice President, Corporate Finance and Investor Relations","Thank you, Whitney, and welcome to Fluor's third quarter 2015 conference call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcements was released this afternoon after market closed, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website which we will reference while making prepared remarks.","But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on slide two. During today's call and slide presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today.","During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at, investor.fluor.com.","Now, I'll turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Geoff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. Before we get to talking about the results for the quarter and our expectations for next year, I want to take a moment and share our perspectives on the markets we serve and what we're doing to strengthen our performance and our competitiveness.","Since our last call, the global economy continues to be sluggish and commodity prices remain depressed. While commodity prices are showing signs of stability, there does not appear to be any near-term catalyst to drive prices up to where they were just a year-and-a-half ago. Lower commodity prices have impacted our customers' cash flow and therefore their ability to fund projects at the same pace.","Nonetheless, we do expect customers to move forward with high-quality or otherwise necessary projects, especially those replacing depleting or deteriorating assets. For example, oil and gas customers need to add production to replace their declining production base as well as to meet the new regulatory demands. Utility customers need to build new power plants to replace retiring generation capacity. Infrastructure customers need to build new roads, replacing aging infrastructure. And the one area which we think is the most challenged to move forward at a rapid pace is LNG where the spread between gas and other energy sources has narrowed significantly and there's a lot of new supply coming online.","Things are never as bad as the meaning would suggest, nor as good as we would hope. Our focus is on the things we can control. Strategically, our company remains committed to the direction we set in 2011. We are focused on our transformation from an EPCM services company to integrated solutions company. This transition allows us to provide lower cost solutions to our customers, improve our margins, and expand our markets.","Our latest investment in fabrication, in the COOEC Fluor Heavy Industries joint venture with its state-of-the-art fabrication yard in Zhuhai, China, gives us large critical modular capability and opens up new markets in which Fluor could not previously participate. The Sacyr Fluor JV on the surface may appear to be just a divestment, but what it really does is allow both companies to pursue work neither of us were able to pursue on our own. Again, this opens up new markets we did not previously have access to.","So now let's move and look at the third quarter results beginning on slide three. Net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were $176 million, or $1.21 per diluted share. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $240 million. Segment profit reflects a modest increase in Oil & Gas results compared to a year ago, offset by lower results from Industrial & Infrastructure, Power and Global Services segments.","Segment profit margin was 5.5%. Total segment profit margins declined as a result of a cost increase on a gas-fired power facility in Virginia that is nearing completion. Oil & Gas margins were 7.9%, up from 5.5% in the third quarter of 2014, and up from 7.4% last quarter. Margin in Oil & Gas reflects an increase in higher margin engineering and design activities, lower overhead costs as a result of our efforts over the last year-and-a-half, and implementations of our integrated solutions execution model.","Revenue for the quarter was $4.4 billion, down from $5.4 billion a year ago, mainly due to lower contributions from the early cycle Oil & Gas work, and the lack of Infrastructure opportunities in our addressable market. New awards for the quarter were $5.3 billion, including $3.6 billion in Oil & Gas, $926 million in Industrial & Infrastructure, $534 million in Power, and $277 in Government. Consolidated backlog at quarter end was $41.7 billion, which is basically flat with last quarter. We have had no cancellations of projects this quarter, but backlog was reduced by approximately $1.1 billion as a result of foreign exchange fluctuations.","Our financial results are summarized on the table on slide four, and I'll continue my remarks on slide five. In the third quarter, the Oil & Gas segment booked $3.6 billion in new awards, including our portion of the KNPC Al-Zour refinery project and a refinery reconfiguration program in the United States. Ending backlog for Oil & Gas segment was $29.1 billion, up 9% from $26.6 billion a year ago. New awards for the quarter in Industrial & Infrastructure were $926 million, including the Bergstrom Expressway project in Austin, Texas. Ending backlog for the Industrial & Infrastructure segment was $6.6 billion compared with $8.6 billion a year ago as we continue to work off the existing mining projects.","Turning to slide six. Revenue in Government was $661 million, up from $615 million a year ago. Third quarter new awards were $227 million, and ending backlog was $3.8 billion compared with $5.2 billion a year ago. In the Power segment, third quarter new awards were $534 million and included the full notice to proceed on a gas-fired power plant in Florida. Ending backlog was $2.2 billion, which compares to $1.8 billion a year ago.","Now, before I move on, I want to take a moment and comment on the announcement that took place Tuesday evening regarding our discussions to support Westinghouse in completing the two nuclear projects. Right now, we're working on a professional services agreement to assist Westinghouse in assessing the construction status of Plant Vogtle's Unit 3 and Unit 4 in Georgia, and two additional units at V.C. Summer Nuclear Station in South Carolina.","During this assessment period, the final terms and conditions will be worked out for a construction-only subcontract under Westinghouse's leadership for both projects. While we don't typically give out specific details, I want to point out that any future contract will be on a cost-reimbursable basis and there will be no liability for pre-existing conditions associated with the prior construction. We are pleased to be working for Westinghouse on these projects and we'll work closely with the talent that is already on both sites.","With that, I'll now turn it over to Biggs for some of the details on operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by providing some additional comments on our performance for the third quarter, then move to the balance sheet.","Please turn to slide seven. As David mentioned, EPS from continuing operations for the third quarter was $1.21 compared to $1.15 a year ago. Earnings include $0.04 per diluted share for pension expenses not included in our guidance. Excluding this expense, earnings would be $1.25 per share.","In the third quarter, the company created a new joint venture with Sacyr Industrial by selling 50% of its ownership interest in the Spanish subsidiary. This resulted in a pre-tax gain of $68 million or $0.30 per diluted share after-tax. This was approximately $28 million more than what we saw as a minimum pre-tax gain we would book. In terms of how this translates into our outlook, this additional gain was offset by the unusually large cost increase on a gas-fired power facility in Brunswick County, Virginia.","Corporate G&A expense for the third quarter was $35 million, comparable with a year ago. Both periods reflect lower comp expense due to a decline in share price. NuScale expenses were up in the quarter and are expected to be $80 million to $90 million for this year and next year as we move toward Design Certification submittal to the NRC. The design certification is critical to being first to market and in attracting new investors. We expect net NuScale expenses to decline after submitting the DCA in 2016.","Shifting to the balance sheet, Fluor's financial condition remains strong with cash plus current and non-current marketable securities totaling $2.3 billion. This compares to $2.4 billion a year ago. Cash flow from operations was $366 million for the quarter and $570 million year-to-date. Year-to-date number is particularly strong considering we pay $312 million in the first quarter for non-recurring legal settlements related to Doe Run. Improvements in cash generation were mainly driven by favorable changes to working capital in Oil & Gas.","During the quarter, the company returned over $176 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Over the last four quarters, we have repurchased $855 million worth of shares. We remain on track to complete our $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of this year.","Moving to slide eight. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $41.7 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 24% at quarter end, and the mix by geography was 34% U.S. and 66% non-U.S.","Before we take questions, I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2015 and 2016, which is on slide nine. We are narrowing our 2015 guidance from continuing operations to a range of $4.05 to $4.20 per diluted share from $4.05 to $4.35 per diluted share, excluding all pension settlement related charges.","For 2016, we are establishing our initial EPS guidance at a range of $3.50 to $4 per diluted share. Our range for 2016 reflects continued weakness in commodity prices. Guidance for 2016 assumes that G&A expense will be in a range of $190 million to $200 million, NuScale expenses of $80 million to $90 million, and an effective tax rate of 33% to 35%. Guidance also assumes capital expenditures will be approximately $300 million.","And comparing 2016 to 2015, I would point to two things which have affected 2015 results. The Fluor Spain gain and the effect of stock price decline on G&A expense. If you adjust for these, the midpoint of our 2015 and 2016 guidance is fairly in line.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our first question from Jerry Revich.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Jerry. Afternoon.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm wondering, David, now that we're closer to hopefully the joint venture CNOOC closing, can you just talk about over what time period do you think that business could be a meaningful earnings contributor to you? And just step us through the plan as soon as you folks close in terms of looking for opportunities to fill up the fabrication yard?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're talking about the fabrication yard?","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, the China fabrication yard.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Yeah Zhuhai. Yeah, we're on track to finish the JV hopefully by year end if not into early next year. I saw some of the slides that are available to us now in terms of opportunity set that is now available that was not available to us before we made this investment. And even though you've got lower cash flow from our customers in the Oil & Gas segment, they're still continuing to spend money. We believe that right now the yard is full with COOEC work, and we expect that to continue. And then, as we expand, folding some of the other programs and projects that were there.","So we feel pretty good that it's going to be profitable and a good earner for us as part of 2016 and then grow from there. As I've said in the past, I've seen these cycles before and these oil companies still have to put reserves on their books. So I think that that's well set to accomplish that, but I would caution you that that yard is not just for offshore. The majority of the work that we're looking at right now is in fact modules for onshore projects primarily in Oil & Gas, but in other markets as well. So 2016, we should see a ramp-up, and then 2017, 2018 on a steady state of growth.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, I would just add, it will be gradual. Let's say, we get the JV form here, end of the year, early next year. And the yard is certainly being utilized today, but the capacity is going to grow over time. So the dollar investments that we're making, and that COOEC is making in that yard will flow into an increased capacity over time. And so it's going to start out at the lower level and then grow.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And then, in I&I, I think you folks are looking at expanding the scope of that business to international markets outside of the U.S. to a greater extend. I'm wondering if you just can flesh out for us when do you think that part of the portfolio, it can become a significant contributor to your business? And just lay out for us how we should be thinking about the action plan there?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'd break it into three pieces. Clearly, one of the biggest contributors over the last few years has been mining, and you've seen the commodity pricing that's there. We are starting to see some, as I've said in the last quarter, we continue to see FEED and study work in the mining sector come in, but again, that's reasonably small in terms of revenue, but it gives us good insight into what's being planned. I really don't anticipate seeing anything of a meaningful nature in mining until late 2016, early 2017.","The second piece of that is Infrastructure. Obviously, we won another project here in Texas, and we're pleased with that. But I'd point you to what we've been able to achieve in Germany and the Netherlands lately. So when you think about the Infrastructure business, I see it growing into Western Europe, Eastern Europe, and then on an opportunistic basis in the Middle East. We're doing the Saudi Landbridge program, which is the heavy freight rail in Saudi Arabia. We're doing the Bay Crossing in Qatar. So that business I think has got a good footprint globally and is poised to grow.","The final piece of that is Industrial Services. And we're seeing really good opportunities in the life sciences and biotech market and that is traditionally three or four places: Singapore, Ireland, Puerto Rico, and then some other places around the globe. But it's kind of conglomerated in those places. We've got a great history of being able to perform there. In addition, in Industrial Services, we're starting to re-engage with some old line customers like Procter & Gamble and DuPont and some others, and we're seeing some partnership style opportunities growing with those traditional customers that fall within that business line.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And lastly, congratulations on the Westinghouse win. I'm wondering, David, if you're willing to give us a framework for how should we think about the Fluor scope of revenue on that project compared to the backlog that CB&I reported. Just some high level of context there would be great.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's premature for us to say right now. We're in the process of supporting Westinghouse in an assessment of those programs. That'll take 30 days to 45 days. So really all we're doing is really supporting Westinghouse right now. I will say that there's great talent on both of those job sites, and hopefully, if Westinghouse sees fit, then we'll be able to work on most of the construction there. But I'd remind you, we won't be doing all of the construction. Westinghouse will still have responsibility for a fair amount of that as well as the fabricated equipment. So we're pleased that Westinghouse has the faith in us, and we'll have to wait and see. But hopefully, towards the end of December we'll know, and we'll announce whenever that \u2013 when that information is available.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Just for clarification, the guidance for 2016 does not include anything from Vogtle and SCANA at this point, is that correct?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When we build the plan, we considered all of our prospects in terms of the 2016 plan.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. So there is a piece assumed in the 2016 numbers?","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, we're just not being discrete on different pieces and how they add up or contribute. There can be upside from a lot of projects, but everything gets considered in terms of its probability, and its size, and its potential range as we go into this. And then, as we get a little further into the year, or into the next year, we'll get more defined with it.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","But it's premature to really give any more clarity than that with respect to how this was considered.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. But it's fair to say it was part of the planning process?","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, it's certainly a part of the process as we went into the last few weeks, yes.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Fair enough. And then separately, can you talk a little bit more about the cost overrun you briefly mentioned in the presentation about the plant in Virginia that, I think you said, offset the gain in the quarter? A little bit more detail on that, and how far along are you on the project? How buttoned-down is it with the charge you've taken?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We are nearing completion of that project. We feel pretty good about our estimates to go. It's been a challenging project. I mean, it's in a geographic area that's had two significantly bad winters, which contributed to that as well as some technical challenges in terms of the machines that are being installed. And we feel good about where we are in our current estimates.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, in terms of \u2013 we don't quantify specific projects, but I think you have a pretty indicative kind of statement in my comments in that we, on Sacyr, on the Spain JV, we recorded $68 million versus the minimum of $40 million. So that's $28 million more recorded than what we anticipated. And that was substantially offset by this cost increase on New Brunswick. So that gives you a pretty good feel for what the size of it was when you're trying to figure out what the relative impact is of both.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got it. Just real quickly, the NuScale costs \u2013 you provided that in the outlook $80 million to $90 million. Okay. I'm good to go. Thank you.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Good evening. I guess, my first question, the revenue in Oil & Gas, the decline was much greater than what I expected, and the declines have accelerated, you didn't mean (23:48) throughout the year. So I guess, David, I mean, is that a big concern? Is it just customers slowing the pace of the projects that you have? And as I look to 2016, what's the risk that projects continue to get lengthened or pushed out, or how to think about revenue for Oil & Gas in 2016?","And I guess the other side of it is, while the revenues have been disappointing, the margins obviously have well surpassed I think most people's expectations, but I'm also assuming you're not going to tell me assume a 7% margin in 2016. So when I look to 2016, do you feel more comfortable with the revenue pace or the margin pace, because just the revenue declines, I guess, have just been somewhat concerning. And then I have a follow-up after that.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Let me start, and then I'll ask Biggs to maybe give a little color to this. And I'll start kind of at a high level. When you look at the oil price drop, clearly all the oil companies kind of took a deep breath and evaluated all of their capital plans. They looked at and prioritized those. And then, in the ones that met that priority, gladly they were most of the ones that we're doing, they're going back and looking is the design proper, is the cost estimate as sharp given current market conditions, because some of these things were estimated a year ago. And boards are asking for more information. So that's what's kind of causing the delay.","The good part is, and it kind of gets to the second part of your question, is as I've stated previously, we have changed the way we're doing work. And in doing so, we're able to provide these customers that are looking for more capital efficiency, exactly that. And I'd kind of contrast some proof there. If you go back a year ago, or a year and a half ago, we were awarded the Clean Fuels program in Kuwait, which was a competitive lump sum turnkey project against open competition. And we won. And in fact, we are buying the majority of the equipment and materials, not our Korean partners.","That same approach led us to the award that's in this quarter on the two packages for the fourth refinery, the Al-Zour refinery. So that's proof that the new approach that we're using, that integrated model that we're using, is giving us confidence that it opens the aperture to the lens that we can go chase. And at the same time, it's satisfying the customers' need for capital efficiency. So I think over the longer term, we'll be hard to beat, and in doing so, when we win these things, we're not doing it on a price basis, we're doing it on a value basis, and we're going to make more money. So I think margins in Oil & Gas will be higher than the last cycle, but I wouldn't tell you it's going to be 7% or 6% or anything else, but over the longer term, it's going to be much better.","Now, when I think about what's in front of us in 2016 within Oil & Gas, as we said, we've had no cancellations and for the projects that have been kind of delayed for that deep breath, or whatever you want to call it, are starting to get to the point where FID is imminent. So I'm not looking for 2016 to be a big growth year, but I do believe the combination of some of these projects moving forward, and our ability to win them and make more money, puts us in a unique position as you get to late 2016, early 2017 and beyond. So based on...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","So it's fair to say \u2013 sorry, David, just because I think you were sort of getting into how you're thinking about the award pace too for Oil & Gas. So as you think about Oil & Gas, I don't even know that it would be in the second half. It's probably more late 2016 at this point before you'd start to see any acceleration in order pace and awards, is probably the proper way to think about it?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's going to be lumpy, Jamie. I think if some decisions that have been pushed come to fruition in the first quarter, first quarter could be big. If they don't, it pushes to second quarter. So I just think it's going to be kind of a lumpy year, and there's some pretty big programs in there.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. And then, Biggs, I don't know if you had any other question, then I had one more question.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I think David gave you a very thorough description of what's happening from a broad standpoint and looking at it over time. Just to drill into the quarter a little bit, the revenues being down relative to what we thought. To be real specific on that, there were no project delays or deferrals in the quarter which affected that number. Obviously, the order book was good. The bottom line was good. Performance was good. I would say more we just missed a little bit in our estimating in terms of how it was going to play out in the quarter, and that there's really no underlying message or concern anybody should have from that circumstance. So we would expect the fourth quarter to be relatively similar in terms of Oil & Gas revenues to the third quarter, and then over the course of next year to grow. So we do expect growth in Oil & Gas revenues next year on the strength of the orders that we've already recorded and we do expect to come in.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And then, sorry, one last follow-up just relative to Westinghouse, and congratulations. And I know you said in the prepared remarks, or actually in the prepared remarks and in response to a question. It's a cost plus. There's no risk to you in terms of pre-existing cost issues, whatever. But David, I just look at this, I don't understand, I mean, it seems like a big win for CBI, a big win for you. I don't understand Westinghouse, but they seem like the loser there. But I mean as you think about this project, is there any risk to Fluor in terms of future \u2013 I mean, where would the risk be to Fluor, if any?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't think there's any more risk to Fluor than any other project that we do. There's obviously reputational risk, because we've got to perform, but we did not and will not accept the same commercial terms that was in the previous contract. So...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","But it's completely cost \u2013 is there any portions of the project that are fixed price, or is it completely \u2013 I'm sorry, is there anything fixed price in there? Is it largely...","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Once we get to that stage, we expect a fully reimbursable contract.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. All right. Thank you. I'll get back in queue.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Alex Rygiel with FBR.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","On the Westinghouse topic, any other opportunities outside of Georgia and South Carolina that you're also in discussions with? And understanding the NuScale \u2013 or excuse me, Westinghouse has its own SMR Technology, any opportunity to kind of marry up NuScale with Westinghouse?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It's premature to say. We think we've got the best SMR Technology that's close to be submitted for Design Certification. So we feel very confident about this. But I wouldn't get too far out over my skis on the Westinghouse relationship. They're a great partner, a great company, and we work well with them. They've got a situation on two projects that they need our support and assistance. And because of that long-term relationship, we're willing to provide that. But we need to make sure we get through this assessment period. They're running the show, and we'll support them any way we can.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Fair enough. And David, you commented that LNG is most challenged. How should we view that statement as it relates to LNG project work and backlog right now?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's a slow roll like it's been. I think you've got several new projects coming online with some pieces of difficulty in Asia. You've got the ones in the States, one or two that are under construction that will go forward. But getting the rest of them to actually a sanctioned FID and actually turning dirt are going to be problematic, I think, as I said, because of that energy spread that exists, and in particular, with the low oil price, most of these are sponsored by significant oil and gas companies where their cash flow is impinged by the price, and maybe their priorities are a little bit different. I think when we look at what's in backlog and what's coming, clearly the refining sector is alive and well. You look at their financials, and they are doing quite well. You look at petrochemicals, and the wave of ethylene crackers that we have underway, again, we have three of them underway right now, and we expect another wave of five to six to move closer to an FID as we go through 2016. So it's not good for the upstream guys right now, but the other parts of those companies are doing quite well.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Steven.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Hi Steven.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Related to Brunswick County, David, you've been very careful on setting up the organization to manage these fixed-price projects to minimize risk. And I do remember that this plan had been competitively bid. Just trying to get comfortable with this fixed price mix that's in the rest of the backlog now. Is there something different about the way the organization was structured for Brunswick County versus the other gas-fired power plants you have in backlog and you're going to put in there? And then, more broadly, the other Oil & Gas projects now you have in backlog on fixed price basis? Just trying to be comfortable with the fixed price mix now.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's a great question. I would put the Brunswick situation in three categories, and none of which do I believe are embedded in how we've done any of the others. And in fact we've learned from this and have implemented some of those learnings as we bid some of these other programs. It falls into three categories.","One is, the weather that we experienced was a huge factor. As you remember, last winter was the coldest winter in a long, long time, maybe in history, and certainly Appalachia, I kind of come from not too far from there, it can be really, really cold, and we had issues associated with weather. Secondly, we had issues with labor productivity, something that is both in and outside of our control. But in terms of the learnings I think that's where we've learned the most. The third piece is, the Mitsubishi machine, that's the first time it's been installed in the United States and the learnings from that put us in I think a better position going forward.","So it's not symptomatic within the organization. You're correct, we've taken a very measured look at many of the programs and projects we're doing including the ones that are fixed price, and I don't see a fly in the ointment, so to speak. And I guess that's kind of what you're getting at relative to what we've got in backlog or the competitive nature of our offerings.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","The Power projects have been competitively bid for the last many years, and we've done well on them over the last several that were competitive bids. So I wouldn't put something in a distinct category just because it happened to be competitively bid. This is more attributable to the things David just described as opposed to being in a competitive situation.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then related to the Westinghouse contract, just trying to think about what the impact would be there on working capital and cash flow, because, I appreciate that there's no perhaps cost overrun risk, but just I imagine you're taking on thousands of employees. And I'm wondering if you're able to structure \u2013 I know it's in process, but will you be able to structure the contract so that there is no cash flow lagging and dragging down of your working capital on cash flow?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not any more than any other project that we do. When we start off, there's obviously a little more expense than cash coming in, but in this case it won't be significant. And again, as I've said, it's premature to even talk about that, because we've got to get through the assessment in support of Westinghouse before we get to what scope we will actually do.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, folks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Tahira.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Tahira.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","David, first question is really in regards to the uptick from backlog. Clearly, given especially the fab yard you've bought, you're in a really good competitive position. So I can see you gaining market share potentially. But how should I think about when I listen to customer calls and they're calling for 30% sort of cost reductions. How does that show up in terms of the optics of what you're booking going forward?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think the relationship with the Zhuhai yard puts us in a very competitive position. It's a low cost producer. You marry that with what I think is probably the best supply chain capabilities in our marketplace, and I feel very comfortable that we can not only satisfy the capital efficiency needs of our customers, but also the profitability that we expect. I actually think that we've been \u2013 I'd like to say we're brilliant, but I think our timing's just right in terms of these investments we've made, the overhead reduction that we went through last year and into this year, the organizational shifts that we've made, focus on directing our (39:35) construction and fabrication. It puts us in I think our sweet spot, and the fact that our customers are prioritizing and looking for lower cost projects falls right smack dab in the middle of the strategy that we've deployed. So I feel pretty bullish on our ability to satisfy our customers, and win, and satisfy our shareholders.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And David, does the other projects in scope just looking smaller, though, as you gain share, is it enough to offset the fact that each small project might be getting smaller in size just because costs are lower on the materials, et cetera?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I don't know. I think the portfolio will still be pretty robust, but clearly, if the customers allow us to do what we've learned, these projects are going to be significantly lower in cost. So therefore, you're going to see a drop in revenue from what the project should look like a year ago and what it should look like going forward. But I don't think that's significantly less, and there are customers that embrace this. All of them are saying that they want more capital efficient programs, and some of them are willing to do things differently, and others aren't. And we'll supply service to them, and do those projects too, but in those cases the projects won't come down 30%.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And last question, David, we've seen some positive movement, at least in headline news on some of the UK nuclear projects. Is that an area that you're looking at, at all, or is it only from the SMR side? So pretty long-term right now?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're looking at both the SMR side and the next-generation reactor there, and in fact we're discussions with some folks. But we're also part of the decommissioning infrastructure in the UK as well, so we're well footed I think in the UK nuclear space.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you very much.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Tahira.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","Good evening, everyone.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Michael.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","David, just again back to Westinghouse and the contract. When I read in documents about liquidated damages and more risk involved, that's just a Westinghouse issue, and as again as you guys negotiate your contract, that's not going to be anything that Fluor needs to be concerned about. Correct?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","Okay. Fair enough. And secondly, when you think about Energy and Oil & Gas and what the customers are going through right now, it's been a year-and-a-quarter since prices have peaked. What do you think it's going to take for customers to get more confident? Is it the dollar price of the barrel of crude oil, or is it just a better sense of global economic activity, or even the U.S. which seems to be seeing a little bit of a soft spot here? What do you think it's going take? And is that something that you could foresee happening in 2016?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Man, if I knew the answer to that, I could retire. You and I could get in all the...","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","Yeah. You could...","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...all the Giants games we wanted to go to.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","You could buy the Cowboys. I know you could.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Yeah. You know, Mike, that's a great question. I'd just make two comments. The first comment is, I'm hearing from many of the oil and gas customers that 70 is the new 100. And I think that what you've got is some stability in terms of oil price. It's volatile. I mean yesterday it was up 6%. Not sure exactly what it ended up today, but I think the oil and gas companies have gotten comfortable with the fact that $120 a barrel isn't something they should plan anything on. So if they're thinking that 70 is the new 100, then they're planning on something that's significantly less than 70.","Now, it's taking time, and the second point I would make is, in this process, these customers, I might risk getting in trouble with some of them, but I think some of them would tell you that $120 a barrel made them lazy in terms of their capital decisions. So they're kind of stepping back again, as I said earlier, and what are those priorities, and what is the actual need from a capital perspective, making sure that they've got that capital efficiency card kind of played within their program. And then slowly, but surely moving towards FID.","So I think that kind of the deep breath has taken place. But they also see that if they don't keep doing, particularly in the upstream, some of these programs that you got to think about it, some of these programs take 10 years from the first test well to actual production. They can't wait much longer. So that new statistic of \u2013 you pick the number, I don't know if it's $50, or $40, or $35, or whatever the number is that they're using in their models, they're clearly using a lower number, and many, many of these projects that we are pursuing make sense at that new number. But it needs to be reconfigured. And we need to \u2013 they need to let us apply some of these things that we've learned in order to get those project values down.","So I think we're kind of in that shakeout period right now where some things are slowly but surely moving towards FID that are in the upstream sector. But that's just one piece, as I mentioned. Refining's doing quite well. Petrochemicals are doing quite well. Power, there's power projects in front of us. There's Infrastructure programs in front of us. So it's not just a one-trick pony for Fluor when it comes to upstream oil and gas.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","That's been very helpful, David. Thank you.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Hi. Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, John.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Hey, John.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","David, I guess in terms of your backlog and what you're talking about now for 2016, how much work left in that backlog was won, or is projects that are being completed based on commodity prices of two years ago? In other words, you're finishing off large projects that need to be finished at this point.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Cerro Verde in Peru is one big one that's kind of finishing up on the last kind of the big mining things that are there. But that's really...","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","And that finishes in 2016?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pardon?","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","That finishes in 2016?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Late 2016, maybe early 2017.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But that's really the only thing of any consequence that finishes next year.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Okay. Okay. I'm just trying to understand how much is contributing to those earnings. And then the second question is in terms of your CapEx guidance, the $300 million, it seems like a significant uptick given the market conditions. Can you talk about that a little bit, maybe what's driving that?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we...","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","I mean of course, it is an estimate. It can be higher or lower.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Yeah.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","The biggest variability of it is associated with equipment demand. So in terms of projects moving to construction and having demands in that regard, we certainly expect growth. We don't expect a lot of growth out of mining at this point as we talked about, which is where certainly a lot of the business in the past has been associated.","The other part of spending is on the more corporate-related CapEx. So to the extent that we have buildings for our own use that we invest in around the world is a demand for capital. We make those decisions as we go through time, in some cases we have options to purchase, and that sort of thing that's embedded in that number. But that's one of the reasons why it'll end up being something different at the end of the day. It might be more or less depending on the circumstances and what we decide to do from a standpoint of lease versus buy.","John Bergstrom Rogers - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks, Biggs. Thank you all very much.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Company.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I guess a couple of them here around the guidance. And I'm just curious as to how much of next year's range do you feel like \u2013 do you believe is already in backlog, has already booked as under contract? And how much more do you need to make that range? How does that compare to history, as well?","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Well, I think, obviously from a historical standpoint our burn relative to backlog has been higher. But that's almost sort of the new norm now. So we'll look at it at the end of the year and we'll actually publish statistic as a part of our 10-K what we expect the burn rate to be of the backlog at that point in time. I think it's a little early to say right now, but it's probably going to end up being a lot like the way this year's was in terms of how it played out, in terms of the relationship of the revenues actually burned out of backlog. I don't expect anything real different. I don't expect it, I don't think there's any more risk to it or any less.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. You said...","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","(50:07), the stretch percentages are consistent with prior years.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. David you said burn is high relative to backlog, do you mean it was low \u2013 you got lower revenue on same backlog?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the burn is a bit low.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","It was higher in the past, it's lower now, yeah.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay. Are there any, are there any, like...","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","And part of that \u2013 I know, there's a lot of conversation about what might be in there that's causing that. But just by the nature of the projects we have being very large, and very long-term in their execution, you're going to have some slower burn.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And one of those projects has been LOGCAP. As you went into fiscal 2015, you guys gave a view of what that would look like. Can you update us on what you think LOGCAP's going to contribute to next year, as it relates to this year?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, based on what \u2013 the same things you read, troop count should be about the same in Afghanistan. So it would be consistent with what we see this year, if there's no other LOGCAP available to us. We did win the one of the call-off contracts in the African continent. But in my conversations with the Army, they still feel like they're going to have a pretty significant presence in Afghanistan, and you read the news, they're probably going to have a few more people in Iraq, and potentially, Syria. So that creates some opportunity for us as well.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, got it. And the African contract is another contingency contract, so you'd need something to happen there for that to deliver results. Is that correct?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's right, that's right. We're following the military and the deployments that they do. I mean a great example of that was the Ebola scare earlier this year, and we were tasked to build facilities and the like for the U.S. Army Medical Corps, and how they dealt with controlling that epidemic. So that's an example of where it's not just \u2013 it's not just war fighters, I guess, is what I'm getting at, there's also some things around humanitarian care that the military gets the mission for, and we're there to support them.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","That's good perspective. Then there's a lot of talk here about tapping the petroleum reserve, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve here. Is that an added profit kicker for you guys as you look into next year, or is that not an earnings driver for you?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, we don't get paid on oil. I wish we did sometimes. No, our contract is to manage a facility. The U.S. Government is going to determine whether they sell off part of it to create some cash flow for them for other purposes and then refill it over time. So that really don't have any impact on our profitability.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Final question, David, just on ethylene. Just curious, you talked about seeing more going through \u2013 can you talk about the impact of low naphtha prices and how that is addressing and affecting the profitability of your customers and the impact that that might have on that next wave of crackers?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it's certainly in the discussion. I really don't know what impact it would have on the plans that are underway or certainly the ones that are being suggested right now because most of them, there's no \u2013 to my knowledge, I don't think any of the ones that are in that next wave are naphtha crackers, but I might be wrong in that.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","But from a competitive standpoint the naphtha somewhere else versus ethane here?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I think the more interesting thing is who's going to be investing in the U.S. in ethylene, and it's the traditional players, but in a lot of cases they're partnering with folks like the Saudis and the Chinese and I think that kind of helps us because of our presence in those other places in terms of building those facilities, the client relationships that we have in those types of places around the world.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from George O'Leary with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company.","George O\u2019Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Just one for me as the rest of my questions have been asked. A lot of talk in the upstream sector particularly around offshore products, but also to some extent on your products onshore projects around standardization. We've heard from some of the manufacturing folks that you can actually reduce the headline project price or project cost, and actually increase the operating income that they can earn. And I was just wondering if that same effect potentially exist for you guys as this standardization phenomenon plays out over time?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. We're well down that road in terms of standard designs and offshore it's all about weight, and reducing weight, as well as the benefits that we're providing in the supply chain of all the commodities. So we're well down the road on that initiative, and in fact, that's what really started for us about four years ago. So I think we're well-positioned and aligned with our customers.","George O\u2019Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc.","Great. Thanks for the response, guys.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","And we'll take our next question from Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good evening. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to ask about the Government segment. I saw some mixed trends there. Revenues were up. New awards down quite a bit. And so following up on the earlier commentary, now that it seems to be Government budgets, particularly the defense budget remains at similar levels, what are you seeing in the pipeline for 2016 and 2017 for Federal work in the United States, and perhaps some of the key international markets as well?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you know, we kind of work for the U.S. Government and the British Government in that space. And we're continuing to see opportunities in the Department of Energy space, if you will. Some of those big programs are in the process of being bid and we're in the process of getting extensions in some others. So you're going to see, in terms of DoE business, some lumpiness just because of when those things come forward. There is some \u2013 one of them in this quarter, but it's just kind of a bridging period before we can take in the full extension. So there's an example, where it was a little bit this quarter, but a bigger number coming later. And that's just in one facility in the DoE space. So there's growth opportunity there, but it's going to be tough competition. Everybody's kind of teamed up with one another. And it's pretty fierce competition.","In terms of the DoD, they're doing the same things that a lot of the private sector's doing in terms of cost rationalization, some shutdowns, being more competitive in terms of how they provide the service to the military. So some of these base contracts will be coming up. And it'll be more based on best value and how much money you can take out of the end game, not just the rate per hour for an individual. But then there's also a fair amount of deployment bases that are coming up for bid during the next two years that we feel like we've got a good position to deal with. So it's going to be a lumpy thing. It's not going to be as big as it was at the height of LOGCAP in Afghanistan. We've said that in the past. But it's a good steady state, almost annuity-type business that provides some of the underpinning of the company. And it's for a pretty good customer.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks. And then on Kitimat, could you update what's going on there?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We continue to support our customer. And again, that's one of those that's been rationalized and poked and prodded and re-estimated. And we're waiting on our customer in what they want to do next. But we're still supporting our customer there. As you may know, they brought a new partner in. The new partner had new ideas. And they're looking at \u2013 we've gone back to some of the FEED documents and incorporated some of the new partner's wishes. So it's going to be a slow roll.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Yeah, our level of effort there has been low over the last year and we would expect it to be that way.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Just a few more clarification questions. On the nuclear projects, did I hear you right that Westinghouse will be keeping some of the work beyond their prior scope?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, they kind of had the whole scope before and they've got the whole scope now.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And we're trying to figure out exactly what they will maintain and what they'll ask us to do for them. So it's kind of \u2013 it's still a little too early to say.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Understood. And then for guidance, just mechanically, were you expecting the $0.30 gain in this quarter earlier in the year or is this a new update for guidance for 2015?","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","No. We were anticipating some gain from this transaction as it was developing. When we had the second quarter call, we were pretty clear that we thought it was going to be at least $40 million, which assuming the tax rate played out as expected would translate to \u2013 at normal tax rate it would have been $0.18. In the call I said, yeah, there are some things to be estimated including the fair value of what we're retaining, which under GAAP we were going to be recording a gain with respect to. And that was something that we didn't know exactly how it was going to play out and that's what produced though ultimately the gain at $68 million relative to the minimum of $40 million. So clearly, the $40 million we said was in our guidance coming in, and then after that it was a range of possibilities that obviously ended up playing out at $68 million. By same token, as I already said, we weren't planning on having any problem projects, so there just ended up being an offset in terms of the circumstances of the quarter and the year between the extra gain that we recorded on the Spanish venture and then the one Power project.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","That's very helpful. And just the last one for me on foreign exchange that's embedded in your guidance.","Biggs C. Porter - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","From a foreign exchange standpoint, there was a slight negative effect in the quarter. It was about $1 billion negative effect on backlog. On EPS, in the quarter, it was about $0.03. I think last quarter it was about $0.02. Other than that \u2013 well, you know, so it's been fairly small and we're not projecting anything significant on a go-forward basis. We do have a lot of natural hedges and specific hedges we've put in place and we would assume that those continue to play out to be relatively effective.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thank you very much.","Operator","This does conclude the question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Seaton for any additional or closing remarks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, operator, and thanks to everyone who participated on our call today. As you can see by the results this quarter, the Oil & Gas group continues to perform well. And customers with high-quality projects continue to move forward even in a tough environment and even as long as some of them are taking to get to FID. Myself along with the rest of our management team have seen a number of cycles like these over the years. We know that it's important to remain flexible, and the decisions we've made over the past few years to cut overhead costs and develop a better solution for our customers gives us just that. As we look ahead to 2016, we see not only some headwinds but also pockets of opportunity. Our ability to deliver in any environment has been proven and enhanced over the last few years.","With that, we really appreciate your interest in our company, as well as your confidence, and we wish everyone a good day.","Operator","This does conclude the presentation.

Please go ahead, Mr. Telfer.","Geoff Telfer","Thank you, Justin, and welcome to Fluor's fourth quarter and year end 2017 conference call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Stanski, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after market close, and we've posted a slide presentation on our website which we'll reference while making prepared remarks.","But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of the existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in the Company's Form 10-K filed earlier today.","During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now, let me turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David Seaton","Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon and thank you to everyone for joining us. I'd like to start off by discussing what we're seeing in the markets that we serve and what we expect to see in 2018.","We expect the economic growth to improve in the U.S. and globally this year. Our U.S. clients are optimistic about the recently enacted tax reform and our clients, both domestically and internationally believe improved commodity prices should drop an improvement capital spending. Also as indicated, we're on the front end of a multi-industry upturn and we're closely tracking and well positioned for many major programs and we expect to get a final investment decision in the next 12 months, particularly in the energy chemicals, mining and metals and infrastructure.","Our energy and chemicals representing several gas monetization projects including ethylene, derivative facilities and LNG, and it includes the LNG Canada project for Shell which we've recently shortlisted. We also see upstream projects moving forward including pipelines. We expect to build off last year's success in mining metals and we continue to track a number of projects slated for FID in 2018 including copper, gold and iron ore replacement projects. While we don't expect to see the super cycle we saw earlier this decade, we do see a path doubling our mining and backlog from it's current levels.","In the infrastructure we're able to start to move forward on the previously awarded Purple Line in Maryland. And one, the Green Line project in Boston in the fourth quarter. Our success continued in 2018 as we were selected with LAX automated people-mover project which we expect to close next quarter. We continue to see transportation programs advance globally and are looking forward to hearing details on the recently announced federal infrastructure funding plans. The plan appears to encourage private investment which I think plays well in our strong track record in developing public-private partnerships.","It's been a busy year in our government group as they held the hurricane restoration efforts in parts of the United States and Puerto Rico. In 2018, we will compete for the LOGCAP V contract and are looking at the hand for liquid waste project which is coming up for rebid this year. We also expect diversified service to improve as clients begin to increase their maintenance spend. We believe 2018 marks the start of the upturn we've been waiting for so long and I can tell you that Fluor is ready. We've grown our maintenance, fabrication and construction capabilities, we made improvements to our systems and processes to improve project delivery and we've invested in new data centric execution platform that will use historical standardized data to more accurately analyze and predict project outcomes. And finally, we're increasing our investment in our people through the development programs.","Now let's look at our 2017 full year results beginning with Slide 5. 2017 net earnings attributable of Fluor $191 million or $1.36 per diluted share. Excluding the onetime impact of the recent tax reform legislation of $37 million or $0.27 per diluted share, the company reported a net profit of $228 million or $1.63 per diluted share. Consolidated segment profit for the year was $545 million. Revenue for the year was $19.5 billion compared to $19 billion a year ago. New awards for the year were $12.6 billion and ending backlog stood at $31 billion.","Now if you turn to Slide 4; the Energy, Chemical and Mining segment booked $1.1 billion in new awards for the quarter including an offshore project in the North Sea, and the backlog for energy, chemicals and mining segment was $17 billion. Results for the year reflected a $44 million forecast adjustment related to estimated cost increases on the downstream project, this project is currently over 90% complete on construction and we expect to achieve mechanical completion in the second quarter. Fourth quarter no awards in industrial, infrastructure and power were $483 million including the Green Line light rail extension project in Massachusetts. Ending backlog was $7.7 billion compared to $15.1 billion a year ago; this decline reflects the removal of the two nuclear projects.","Regarding the remaining three gas-fired power plants we're currently executing, one project is substantially complete and in commissioning in start-up activity phases. The remaining two projects are approximately 75% complete and will be completed by year end. One of these projects incurred an additional charge of $41 million in the quarter.","Turning to Slide 5; the government group posted four quarter no awards of $1.1 billion and an ending backlog of $3.8 billion compared to $5.2 billion a year ago. New awards for the quarter were driven by task or awards from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to restore the power in Puerto Rico. I had a chance to visit our people in Puerto Rico a couple weeks ago, saw firsthand how we're helping restore power on the island. We understand how difficult the last few months have been for so many families, we're humbled by the outpouring of support from the communities in which we work. Since our arrival in October, we've restored power to nearly a 0.25 million customers and we've -- as a side note, we've been active in Puerto Rico since the 1950s and long-term Fluor employees there are some of those that have suffered from this devastating storm.","The Diversified Services segment posted fourth quarter no awards of $568 million including projects to support clients and the consumer products, power and the energy industries. Ending backlog was $3.5 billion compared with $2.9 billion a year ago.","Now let me turn and turn it over to Bruce. Bruce?","Bruce Stanski","Thanks, David and good afternoon, everyone. We have a lot to review today, so let's get started with our quarterly results. Please turn to Slide 6 of your presentation.","Let me begin by highlighting some income statement items and then move to the balance sheet. Revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, up slightly from $4.9 billion last quarter. Revenue improved in the government and diversified services segment to offset the declines in energy and chemicals. Corporate G&A expense for the fourth quarter was $54 million compared to $56 million last year. Earnings for the fourth quarter were $60 million or $0.43 per diluted share, this does however include $37 million or $0.27 per diluted share related to a onetime charge arising from the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in December. The principle amount of this charge was related to Fluor revaluating its deferred tax assets on the balance sheet from the previous federal statutory rate of 35% to the new rate of 21%.","Excluding these tax effects earnings would have been $97 million for the quarter or $0.70 per diluted share. In addition to help frame the quarter a bit, it's important to point out that our results include a benefit of other international tax items unrelated to U.S. tax reform which contributed approximately $0.16, the non-recurring hurricane work in the United States and Puerto Rico which produced $0.09, and a $0.32 charge related to both, a gas-fired project and a downstream project. The paint is still very much drying on tax reform and we caution that our tax rate maybe varied by period as we received additional clarification; I'll talk more about outlook for tax on Slide 10. But shifting to the balance sheet on Slide 5; Fluor's cash plus current and non-current marketable securities for the quarter was $2.1 billion; this is unchanged from last quarter and from a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $602 million for the year. Also for the full year we paid $118 million in dividends.","Moving to Slide 8; Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was just under $31 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 37% compared to 25% a year ago when we did have two large reimbursable nuclear projects in our backlog. At quarter end, the mix by geography was 42% U.S. and 58% non-U.S.","Turning to Slight 9; I want to cover the new revenue recognition standard that went into effect on January 1. Prior to the adoption of this new standard, the Company segmented revenue and margin recognition between the engineering and construction phase of it's contract. Now we will recognize the entire engineering construction contract as a single performance obligation. As you can see on this graph which is for illustration purposes only, what that does is reduce the segment profit variability. Instead of recognizing higher margin engineering first and transitioning to a lower construction margin as we move into the field, now we'll recognize a consistent margin throughout the duration of the project. You'll mainly see the effect this new revenue recognition standard in our ECM and IIMP segments and only on those contracts for engineering as part of the total performance obligation; this is in no way impacts engineering only contracts.","You'll see our results reported under this new standard starting in Q1 of 2018. To help our shareholders translate from the old recognition system, we will be providing a reconciliation in each quarter of 2018 showing earnings per diluted share using the new standard compared to EPS under the old standard. Now however this is an incremental positive for earnings in 2018 as some engineering work performed in prior periods will be re-recognized using the modified retrospective method, this method does not change prior periods but simply adjusts opening balances. Overtime the new standard should result in less variability in our recognition of revenue and margin over the term of the contract. Lastly, I want to point out that starting in Q1 of 2018 we've moved our mining business into our industrial, infrastructure and power segment to better align our external reporting with how these business segments will be managed.","I'll conclude my remarks today by commenting on our new guidance for 2018 which is on Slide 10. We're establishing a 2018 earnings guidance range of $3.10 to $3.50 per diluted share. The EPS range is inclusive of the new revenue recognition standard and also assumes G&A expenses of approximately $210 million to $22 million excluding any impact of foreign exchange gains or losses. We're also assuming a yearly tax rate of 25% to 30%. New scale expenses are to be approximately $75 million in 2018. Based on our current interpretation and analysis, the benefit of the new revenue recognition standard and tax reform in the U.S. will be approximately $0.75 to $0.95 per diluted share and approximately two-thirds is related to new revenue recognition standard and one-third related to U.S. tax reform. Our guidance reflects an expectation of gradually quarter of the improvement in 2018. You anticipate average full year margins in energy and chemicals groups to be in the 6% to 7% range; industrial, infrastructure and power including mining but excluding new scale to be in the 3.5% to 4.5% range, diversified services to be around 4.5% to 5.5%, and government to be approximately 3% to 4%.","So with that operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today will come from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher","I just wanted to ask about the guidance. The release says that the guidance assumes an increase in oil and gas and mining and infrastructure opportunities; can you just give us a little more clarification on what you assume has to happen from here and when it will happen as they hit that guidance?","Bruce Stanski","Well, we're not going to talk specifically about each project but as we said in the past, we do believe the new awards are backend loaded for the year; so we think that new awards will build as we go through the year, as will our earnings.","Steven Fisher","I mean, if the new awards are backend loaded, I mean how much of an impact do you assume that's going to be for 2018 versus 2019? I guess, I'm getting at -- are that some of these big things that you're just bidding is at embedded in what still has to happen in 2018 or is that more forward-looking?","Bruce Stanski","I think it's a little bit of both, Steve. And I mean, obviously the things that are in front of us, the book are very large projects that are multi-year in terms of their barn [ph]. Most of these projects are at least two years in duration, if not three, and multi-billion dollar kinds of kinds of projects. So the guidance certainly bakes in what we think when the win quarter would be and what that burn would end up being. I know I'm not answering this specifically but I'm not going to give you all the details on which projects.","Steven Fisher","The margin target is certainly helpful; the 6% to 7% for E&C stands out as a little higher than expected. Just wondering how much of that is some of the re-recognition verse that you talked about versus any kind of mix changes versus kind of fixed price? And is that 6% to 7%, would that be considered more normalized or again, is that sort of a onetime step-up because of some of the re-recognition?","David Seaton","The answer is that, I want to put a point on that. As we focus on integrated solutions throughout the last two years and perfected some of those things. We believe that the margin in backlog today and what it will going forward will be better than it's been in previous cycles, so fair amount of that is just an improved execution base in the margin associated with that, so Bruce you can follow-up with that.","Bruce Stanski","Certainly the margins that we're talking about are the margins we're having on our range of earnings guidance, so that's total for the year all-in as we look at quarter-on-quarter what we're making as margins in each of the segments. But maybe I'll take a minute here and get in front of maybe you and others questions about this whole revenue recognition adjustment and we did provide the range of $0.75 to $0.95 and we broke it down how much we believe is rhetoric versus the tax reform. But just to put this in context, revenue recognition change for us impacts about 125 active projects whose quarterly results will vary depending on how the work progresses through each of those projects and the mix of those projects in the quarter, and tax reform has similar challenges as we have to recognize tax from the territorial source of the work including new work and existing work.","And also -- and this is where the two are interrelated, that's kind of why we're given a single range is the revenue recognition provides new tax rates that we have to apply to re-recognize revenue on these 125 different projects. So I guess what I'm saying is they are very interrelated we won't know the exact impact of rhetoric [ph] in tax reform until we close each quarter of the year; that's why we're given ranges and estimates that we think are most accurate today. Does that help, Steven?","Steven Fisher","I guess maybe one follow-up; is it fair to ask then if we think about beyond 2018, if you have the same mix of what you have in 2018, would you still come up with the 6% to 7%?","Bruce Stanski","Yes, we would, yes.","Operator","Our next question will come from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie Cook","First question; not that I'm going to allow you to back out the charge in E&C in the quarter but if you do back that out your implied margins in that segment were about 7% which is higher than I would have thought. So can you talk to whether any onetime gains or mix or anything driving that margin if we back out to $29 million on the petrochemical project? And then, understanding you don't want to give guidance within guidance; can you talk about -- you seem much more constructive this quarter relative to the past two quarters and even last quarter on the opportunities on the E&C business, so can you rank order in terms of award opportunities as we're sitting here 12 months out, is it bigger in E&C or is it bigger in mining in terms of the potential award trajectory? Thank you.","David Seaton","What was the first question?","Jamie Cook","The first question was why were your margins good in the E&C extra charge \u2013 extra $29 million that was\u2026","David Seaton","It's the answer I gave to Steven. I think the approaches that we're using on those projects that we've been able to fully implement the new strategy, the integrated solution or providing us with better returns than we've had in previous cycles and I believe that that will continue. So I think part of the question was anything special in there that led that to be that number, the answer is no. So I think that going forward we're doing a much better job of that. Now in the new awards -- and I think I said in prepared remarks the really sizable projects that are in front of us right now are primarily in oil and gas, with mining second; and then I would say infrastructure is following behind that. But as we've talked in the past there is such huge pent-up demand, I was in the Middle East last week over the weekend and just kind of looking through the Gulf, the stated spend over the next five or six years is $500 billion just in the Gulf in the oil and gas sector. I think that's -- you add to that the other industries out there but then you multiply that by the number regions of the world, you can see the opportunity slate has grown dramatically over the last two years.","Now we still got to get these customers to get -- pull the trigger on some of the spending and we're very well positioned for our fair share which as you know, I like a bigger fair share to be a fair share. There is a lot of opportunity globally and I really think -- my concern right now is if all the stuff happens at the same time we can end up with another super cycle in oil and gas that we saw in the first part of 2000s and the issues that go with that. But I feel good about the opportunities in front of us that are really good about the positioning that our people have put us into in terms of those projects and I'm even more optimistic given the success of some of the projects that were bid and are operating under that integrated solution. As I said, I was in the Middle East, I was in Kuwait and went above the clean fuels project, as well as the new refinery project and I'm quite happy with what I saw in terms of execution and in terms of our financial position on those projects.","We've got to get some spending going, we got to get some customers to actually sign on the dotted line in terms of that FID but I'm pretty optimistic about oil and gas. And then on mining there are some very large projects, I mean I don't think it will be what it was in the last cycle because most of it's replacement capacity as opposed to new capacity. They are not really relying on a growing channel anymore, they're looking at how they maintain market share and that's what's driving those things. And I think there are very few companies in that particular segment that can do these big projects. So we feel pretty good about our positioning on those that we're pursuing, and in both cases, it's all over the globe, there is no one place geography wise that stands out over another.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich","David, can you talk about your expectations of the margin profile of the next set of projects, you know, the whole industry has struggled a bit on the last sort of major awards couple of years ago in terms of executing to those projects. And I'm wondering, if you could talk about the competitive landscape as you see it now and what changes should we be looking for in the bid process for hopefully better outcomes?","David Seaton","I think I've always said that it's a dog fight every day and I still believe that, there is no such thing as a good day with competition. I think that in the last cycle you saw some people take some pretty predatory pricing approaches and they're suffering from that. We tried to -- kind of select the projects we felt more comfortable with and the customers we felt more comfortable working with, and even saying that we had our own challenges; and we dealt with those and we learned from those but we've talked about the margin profile going forward in terms of all the industries as Bruce indicated. But I would say we kind of try to stick to our knitting and those projects that make the most sense for us, where we have a competitive advantage, as well as the technical edge.","So, as I said, I feel like we're positioned very well on a lot of these projects that are in front of us from methanol projects to LNG projects to refinery projects and petrochemicals; so I feel really good about the team there and what they've been able to do and what's been probably the worst capital approval process I've seen in my career. If you really think about it, there has been close to no spending, I mean obviously there has been spending but not of any consequence in half a decade. And because of that you've got -- you had our competitors being predatory because we enjoy that diversity and we don't have to take some of those projects where many of our competitors are in one industry as an example; so the diversity plays well for us and allows us to maybe take a little bit different tact.","But as I've said in my answer to Jamie, I think there's a herd mentality in the industry. And when spending starts, they feel like they've got to make sure they're in the head of the queue for everything from pipes and motor and pumps and alike as opposed to those that are going to be later in the cycle. So I think discipline is something that we're going to continue to play, I think discipline in terms of the elements of the integrated solution that we've invested in, the tools and systems we've invested in in this downturn, as well as the investment in the people we've made I think we're in a really good position. But again, staying true to that discipline and the projects that really fit our needs is going to be things that we're going to focus on.","Jerry Revich","Maybe just a question for Bruce; there was a $300 million to $350 million adjustment to retain earnings, Bruce. Can you talk about was that all related to revenue recognition and can you just give us a rough sense as we think about pro forma margin profile for Fluor over the past couple of years if we were to apply the lens of the new accounting standards -- what sort of adjustment should we be making to margin structure versus reported on '16 and '17 just so we can gauge cycle or recycle performance with the new accounting going forward?","Bruce Stanski","I think you might be referring to the $300 million to $350 million range in our K that we've put out, the impact of revenue recognition. So that range is over three plus year period, so that kind of gives you an idea how it lays out over the time period. As far as very much like what I said in my prepared remarks, was -- this takes out the variability of our revenue and earnings recognition, so the margins that we're quoting on a go-forward basis will be more consistently achieved because we won't have the higher margins on the engineering work then the lower end construction and you and us having to model all that out; so I don't know if that helps you talk about cycle over cycle, that's kind of my answer.","Jerry Revich","So just to clarify the fact that we're making a negative adjustment through retained earnings means margins would be negatively adjusted in prior years of rule to apply the current accounting standards, correct?","Bruce Stanski","Certainly, for the next period that we talked about, it's accretive to earnings, the revenue recognition standard; and it goes beyond this next period. Again, how it falls out, and the time period, and the framing of it; we will know as we close each and every quarter. One of the things from the tax perspective as I said they are interrelated is, unlike a lot of companies that do an estimate of taxes at the beginning of the year and then true up at the end of the year, we actually do a hard close on our taxes every quarter, makes it a little more difficult to model but we think it's more prudent way to get our tax rate right every quarter. So we're going to be seeing as we close these quarterly books exactly where we land on Rev Rec and tax, and so will you when we close the quarter.","Operator","Next will be Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Tahira Afzal ","David you talked about a lot of your sectors, you didn't talk that much about power; any thoughts in terms of outlook over there? And then on the LNG side, you mentioned some in Canada but will love to get some color on what you're seeing in the U.S. as well.","David Seaton","On the LNG, I mean obviously there is one we're pursuing in the Gulf Coast. As I've said in previous, I think we're going to see one 1C and 2Cs [ph] over the next couple of years as some of these other ones come online that are nearing completion and the market absorbs that LNG product. But those, you know -- the one in the Gulf and one in Canada, I think we're very well very well positioned for. When you think about power in general, we'll continue to pursue projects -- gas-fire projects and other renewables. We're looking at pursuing nuclear in Saudi Arabia and some other places; so I mean it's one of these things where I go back to my comment just a minute ago about discipline. And in hearing to that integrated solutions approach; so I think that there are some opportunities out there that are on the gas side kind of near-term, say this year. And I think the other stuff is in the out years but we're going to continue to pursue in other things that make sense in the power sector. We do have some good projects in that market as opposed to the four that we've dealt with over the last two years, and we'll continue to push that market as well.","Tahira Afzal ","Just as a follow-up; you touched on nuclear bit, some pretty big milestone for new scale, fairly recently any thoughts in terms of update over there, David?","David Seaton","We've had some really good news in terms of the technical review and I believe the NRC is on-target to complete that piece of the review early which just gives us confidence that we're going to finish the whole process I think in record speed. And once we've got that good housekeeping seal of approval, our focus right now and after that is obviously to bring in new investors and to continue to find other customers. We're looking to the DOE and I actually met with some government officials in the UK yesterday and there is great interest in the SMR technology there.","So I think that as steady as she goes but I think the fact that the NRC is progressing the way it's progressing shows that new scale really had its act together in terms of where the technology was, what the key issues were going to be and we're very prepared to feel those questions and provide the answers to satisfy the NRC. So all-in-all, I feel pretty positive about that schedule; and with that schedule I feel better about bringing in additional investors.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andy Caplots [ph] with Citi.","Unidentified Analyst","David, customers obviously have been talking more about CapEx, probably because of tax reform or partly because of higher commodity prices. Have you seen and hearing some [indiscernible]? Have you seen the precursors of these projects yet? Was the higher margin in EC&M add along with the quarter because engineering utilization is up?","David Seaton","No, I mean see -- I would say this up, this quarter necessarily we've got a lot of feed work going on in the early stages of projects but now I wouldn't say that's impacting the margin per say but when you look at some of the decisions that are being taken; it's in-line with what our expectations were going to be.","Unidentified Analyst","David, you've obviously seen several cycles now and you kind of alluded to that; how would you compare today's funnel when you add up, call it your high probability energy in mining projects versus the crackers a few years ago on versus the risks of finding cycle in 2000s, is it bigger when you added all together than those cycles or same or maybe smaller?","David Seaton","I think it's bigger, I think it's bigger. Projects are bigger, there is more of them because of the delay. I'm pretty bullish on what that future looks like, there is some really good projects in the funnel right now to use your term. I would say it's bigger than the '05, '06 timeframe.","Unidentified Analyst","That would be pretty good if it develops like that. [Indiscernible].","David Seaton","I tell you, you cannot hand it on tax and I'll address that. I would argue that on the oil and gas cost, tax reform is good but it's not going to drive their decision making. Most of their projects are global in nature and yes, good deal for earnings but I don't think the lion's share of them -- the decisions won't be driven by that. Where I think it's going to really have a benefit is in advanced manufacturing, pharmaceuticals, some of the fine chemical work that we do but because it helps those companies become very competitive, particularly with the U.S. manufacturing base, much more competitive on a global scale and much more comfortable to invest in that uprating or increased capacity or even a new facility, and we're tracking us a lot of those projects in the manufacturing sector. Now they are not multi-billion dollar projects but they are really good projects that are $200 million to $300 million and there is a lot of them; so again, I go back to the comment about diversity.","We're going to have the big stuff that you guys like to see and it does drive our business but I think the base load of those small to medium sized projects is growing much more than I anticipated. And I think it's going to bode well for all of our sectors. I think the other piece in my prepared remarks; we think about store in that whole maintenance piece of our business, people stop spending and when they stop spending on certain things like that they start to have failures. And the shutdowns get longer with more work and the frequency of those issues pick up; so I think it bodes well for store and the rest of that diversified services business to again be part of that diversity that raises the water level for the ship here. So, I'm pretty bullish I think on the future; the question is going to be is when? And all indications are, and I'll give you the example; I was worried about the year ended with new awards, it was a low for over many years.","We had two big projects that were -- the client said we're going to sanction. That we already have the projects, we're going to sanction in the fourth quarter, and in fact, both of them moved in the second quarter or -- no, one in the second quarter and one in the third quarter of 2018. So again, project makes sense, business model works, we're ready to go; well, let's wait one more quarter to see what else we can do. So again, the frustration here is at what point do we get to start on these projects and there are projects, we haven't lost anything that we've really pursued in terms of those big projects. So I think we're kind of in an interesting place and I think we're well positioned as I've said but timing is going to be the volatility this time as opposed to how we segment our business.","Operator","And next will be Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.","Michael Dudas","David, when you look at today's year-end backlog, how much would you peg as backlog levels been or secured prior to your integrated solutions improved tools and solutions methods, and relative to what's in there today using those, and will those types of opportunities allow the continued improvement in -- axel [ph] margin in backlog and the execution to drive improved margin performance over this upcoming cycle. A firm, relatively meaningful basis if the cycle turns out the way we hope will.","David Seaton","Yes, hard question to answer Michael and the reason is that most of the projects that are in that reimbursable bucket, we care that our customers are embracing the Integrated Solutions approach but as we've talked about, some of them aren't. So you've got a sizeable amount of our backlog that -- it doesn't matter, right, we're going to do what they asked us to do and we're going to make money on it. The fixed price component, clearly the 4 Fluor projects weren't but we're almost done with those and the project in the oil and gas sector was also bid prior to that. So I would say it's a pretty small percentage of the fixed price portion that we're still working off.","Michael Dudas","And as the cycle emerges to the business that traditional customers are just going to hire you and pay for; when do you think they will start to see that there might be tightening in labor, engineering talent, fabrication, yard facility, and in this cycle will a company like Fluor be able to extract more value from that in 2019, 2020, 2021?","David Seaton","I think absolutely, that's why we put together that whole process and we invested in our tools and systems, we invested in our supply chain, fabrication, the construction capability of the company, so we've got that one-stop shopping approach that our customers are looking for; and in the same vein be able to kind of protect our way of executing an earning on those projects. So I think we're going to start to see -- break it down a little bit here, I think we already have pinch points in construction, we've seen in some of these projects that the industry -- not just Fluor but the industries had issues with -- it's almost exclusively because of either lack of talent or lack of people in that construction rank. What we've done globally is look at training and make sure that when those people aren't available to us in a location, we're setting up training programs to make sure we've got the welders, and the pipe fitters, and the electricians, and alike; so I think we're a little bit ahead of the game on that.","I know we're marching backwards but I think construction is going to be the first place we see the pinch point because we've already seen it. Couple of years ago what we thought we were going to see before oil prices drop, I was really worried because we had to go to somewhere around 50,000 craft in the U.S. with the work we had but the projection said we needed to double that; I think that would have been an impossible undertaking given the situation at that time. Now again, since then we've spent a lot of time and effort on training people, so I think we feel good about being able to get those folks.","On procurement, I think you'll start to see the pinch point in several ways but it's probably not until we get into late 2018 or early 2019. And you're going to see it in two ways; one is, there is going to be a saturation point given the capacities that are out there. And that's the first thing we'll see, it's going to be not how much does it cost but when can I get it which we've seen in the last cycles. Second piece is, is when they become stretched qualities challenge, so we're going to have to make sure that we're in those shops managing that work, and in some cases in this current cycle right now we've got fabrication yards that are providing for us, not the ones we own but we've actually had to go in and take over the management of those yards to make sure we can get the deliveries that we have to have.","So quality is going to be the second thing that I think wanes [ph] but we won't see that until late 2019. Again, I go back to what I've said, if FIDs and pulling the trigger happens in the first quarter that would be the timeframe that we would see.","On engineering, for us I don't see that it as a big challenge, and that's for two reasons. I still think that we're an employer of choice and the folks that have the big projects, that's where those people want to go to come and work and we've proven time and again that drawing those folks at our locations from an engineering and project management perspective have not been a challenge. Second piece of that is, in that integrated solutions model is the investment tools and systems that we've made and the dispersed execution so that we don't have to take Houston over 4,000 people again. We can leave it around 2,800 and the other offices where they are and moderately increase each of them that are supposed to having those booming bust this industry has typically had in those engineering offices.","So, again, we had improved it, the projects in Kuwait [ph], I can tell you're proving that the process but until we get these awards going, we're not going to know whether any of those predictions on engineering, procurement or construction come true.","Operator","And our next question will come from Andy Whitman [ph] with Baird.","Unidentified Analyst","I guess I wanted to ask a little bit about book and burn type business; what a good number or maybe historically how much revenue have you seen from book and burn type business and how does that compare to your expectations for 2018 for that type of business?","Bruce Stanski","We don't provide revenue guidance here and I guess our book and burn -- it certainly was a bit light in the quarter, about 0.66. Certainly we expect that book and burn ratio to pick up as we book larger projects that David just talked about into our portfolio going forward, and a higher burn rate as they move through their life cycles but certainly this was a low quarter for book and bill and book and burn as you call it, and we expect it to increase.","Unidentified Analyst","I guess I'm specifically asking about that types of smaller projects that don't actually hit backlog if they contribute to revenue. Is that material -- is there any changes that's happening to the historical rates of that type of work?","Bruce Stanski","Certainly in our O&M businesses and the big star here in the quarter has been Puerto Rico, we've brought that out a couple of times where we get -- we do quick burns on revenue as it comes in and that -- certainly that does impact our book to burn ratio in a positive way but not in a sustaining way, and it comes and goes as the need arises and the urgency increases for that contingency work that we do; and that also extends into what we do for the army and contingency operations. Stork [ph] is another example of that where they take on a lot of work quickly, certainly at the end of a period or as David said, as assets get distressed and they are forced or our customers are forced to move out quickly and engage store can push a lot of money to have to get their assets back operational. Yes, positive impact but not sustainable.","Unidentified Analyst","As just looking at your K, do you still -- do you have some decent operating losses that potentially could sell-through your cash taxes this year? How do you expect your cash taxes to compare to your GAAP reported taxes? Are you going to realize some of the benefits this year, do you expect to? And how much?","Bruce Stanski","Well, certainly we're sorting through the whole tax profile now and the new tax reform act has a lot of good things. You see the onetime chart we took in the fourth quarter for our deferred tax assets where a good thing of lowering the U.S. tax rates 21% equals the charge in fourth quarters because we had put those deferred tax assets on our balance sheet at 35% tax rate, we had to write it down to 21%. So there are a lot of moving parts like that relative to our tax portfolio and profile that we again -- I keep repeating myself, we'll be understanding better and better as we close each quarters for 2018.","Operator","And our next question will come from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard","Just a question for you on Puerto Rico; how far long are you in executing those projects? By my numbers I think you're around 25% of the way down, just trying to think through -- just how the other earnings contribution cadence ramps from $0.09 this past quarter and to the beginning of the year set at stage four?","David Seaton","We're about 80% done, not 25% done. We've got about another month to go with the task order that we were given. I think we're at 82% or 83% complete as of the end of January. So again, as Bruce said, that's quick book to burn because it burns from October through the end of March.","Bruce Stanski","And the task orders we had on that were approximately $1 billion to give you for Puerto Rico.","Chad Dillard","And then could you spend some time talking about your government project pipelines, and more particularly, LOGCAP V and how this opportunity could differ in terms of revenue new contribution size versus LOGCAP IV?","David Seaton","Well, the way they are biding in, obviously you're bidding multiple areas for task order V; so that includes obviously the Afghanistan command, the Africa Command, and alike and we're active in all of those. I think the profile that you see, the U.S. military follow is probably going to be pretty consistent. So I think that that will continue to be a big part of our earnings stream over the long-term. There are several things in the DOE world that we're pursuing, there is some rebids that are going on, as well as some of the base operation contracts that are coming up. So it's a pretty robust slate of projects, but clearly LOGCAP is the big dog on that block.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer session. I'll now turn the conference back over to the presenters.","David Seaton","Thank you, operator and thank you to all the participants on the call today. As I mentioned earlier and throughout the questions, I'm encouraged by the commentary from our clients regarding their capital spending plans and the overall economic outlook but again I caution the timing of which just because of those decisions. We have prepared for this turnaround and investment and I think our Integrated Solutions approach, our people and our redoubling our commitment to safety has put Fluor in a unique position. I greatly appreciate your support of Fluor, and I wish you a good day.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today's conference call. We do thank you for your participation today."],"9309":["Fluor (NYSE:FLR) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 31, 2013  5:30 PM ET","Executives","Kenneth H.

Please go ahead, Mr. Lockwood.","Kenneth H. Lockwood","Thanks very much, operator. Welcome, everyone, to Fluor's Third Quarter 2013 Conference Call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after market close and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making our prepared remarks today.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2 of the presentation. During today's call and presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today, and in our Form 10-K, which was filed on February 20.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures and reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and are posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","So with that, I'd like to turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton","Thanks, Ken. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us on this Halloween. We'll try to be brief so that everyone can go trick-or-treat. Today, I'll be reviewing our results for the third quarter, our guidance for the balance of this year and we'll talk about the initial guidance for 2014.","If you turn to Slide 3, I'd like to begin by covering some of the highlights of the third quarter performance. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for the quarter were $173 million or $1.05 per diluted share, which represents an increase of 20% and 22%, respectively, over last year.","Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $311 million, which increased from $278 million a year ago. Segment profit resulted -- results reflect a 24% increase in Oil & Gas, as well as improvement in our Power segment.","Consolidated revenue for the quarter declined to $6.7 billion, with growth in Oil & Gas and Power segment, which was offset by lower revenues in Mining & Metals, as well as our business line -- our Government business line.","New awards for the quarter were $5.6 billion, including $2.4 billion in Oil & Gas, $1.9 billion in Government, $846 million in Power.","Consolidated backlog for the quarter was $36.5 billion. This compares with $37 billion last quarter.","Importantly, margins in new award and backlog continued to track above levels we experienced a year ago.","Our financial results were summarized in the table on Slide 4. And as you know, full detail by segment is included in the earnings release.","Continuing my remarks on Slide 5. Oil & Gas awards for the quarter included our share of the engineering, procurement and construction award for the Chevron Phillips Chemical ethylene (sic) [ethane] cracker project in Texas and award to debottleneck an existing oil sands facility in Canada. The CPChem award to Dow Chemical cracker, which was awarded to Fluor earlier this year, and the FEED award for Sasol's proposed cracker were evidence that Fluor's strong market position in petrochemicals. I feel very good about our capture rate in this very important market.","In addition to petrochemicals, we continued to be optimistic about prospects for a number of LNG projects, including the ongoing FEED for Anadarko's Mozambique project. As well as in North America, we expected to hear decisions in the next few quarters on our bids, both for the Kitimat project in Canada and the Cameron project in Louisiana.","In downstream, we continue to track several key prospects, including refinery work in Mexico, Canada, as well as in Middle East. We hope to receive full notice to proceed on the North West Redwater upgrader project in Canada within the next 2 quarters.","We continued to expect the demand for FEED work will translate into significant EPC awards over the next year, 1.5 years. Ending Oil & Gas backlog for the quarter was $18 billion, which is leveled with last quarter.","Moving to Industrial & Infrastructure. New awards for the quarter were $472 million. Backlog stood at $13.8 billion, continuing its downward trend from $18 billion a year ago. While a number of the new awards during the quarter were modest, the group is pursuing a number of road and rail infrastructure projects in North America and several developing opportunities in Mining & Metals. I'm pleased to announced that the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge was completed and opened for traffic during the third quarter, which was on time. I want to commend our project team for its outstanding performance in delivering this complex project to our customer. As you will know, our success on this bridge was key to our winning the Tappan Zee project in New York earlier this year.","Now with regard to Barrick's announcement today on the Pascua-Lama project, that is not a surprise to us. It is evidence of more headwind that we have within our Mining & Metals group and, certainly, we've taken that into account in our guidance range for 2014. We fully expect to participate in this project and it's -- when it comes back in that phased approach that Barrick was speaking about. And because of that, our backlog will not change. We're very confident in our ability to return to that project once they make their decisions and once you see some of the commodity prices return.","If you'll turn to Slide 6. New awards for the quarter for Government were $1.9 billion, including the annual funding of the multi-year Department of Energy contracts at Savannah River and Portsmouth and task orders on LOGCAP IV contract. Ending backlog for the Government segment was $1.8 billion. This compares with $1.6 billion a year ago.","With regard to LOGCAP IV, we expect task order volume to continue to moderate downward as a number sites and personnel that we serve are reduced. 2014, we anticipate full year revenue of approximately $1 billion, down from $1.6 billion in 2013.","I want to briefly address the government shutdown that occurred at the start of the fourth quarter. While some of our competitors reported workforce furloughs, fortunately, the impact of Fluor's programs were minimal, as most of our projects continued to be fully funded.","Moving to Global Services. The segment reported $25 million in segment profit and $150 million of revenue for the quarter, which compares to $29 million in segment profit and $159 million in revenue a year ago. These modestly lower results were mainly driven by reduced contributions from the equipment business line in the quarter. This group continues to be very active in supporting Fluor projects, as well as external customers.","In Power, new awards were $846 million, which included $800 million for the clean energy gas-fired power plant for Dominion Virginia Power. Backlog improved to $2.1 billion, up from $1.6 billion a year ago. And the Power group continues to track opportunities for new gas-fired plants, solar facilities, the plant betterment programs, as well as work on some new nuclear facilities.","With that recap, I'll turn it over to Biggs, who will review some of the details of our operating performance and the EPS guidance. With that, Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to Slide 7 of the presentation. As David indicated, consolidated backlog at quarter end was $36.5 billion. The percentage of fixed-price contracts in our overall backlog was 19% at quarter end, up from 16% last quarter. Major new awards in Oil & Gas and Power drove our U.S. backlog percentage to 34%, up from 30% last quarter.","Moving to corporate items on Slide 8. G&A expense for the quarter was $46 million, which compares with $41 million a year ago. Increased expenses in the quarter were primarily due to higher stock price-driven compensation costs.","The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29%, which was lower than our expectations, in large part due to an increase in earnings from noncontrolling interests, for which income taxes are not typically the responsibility of the company. Also, current quarter taxes benefited from research and development credits, while last year's third quarter was adversely affected by foreign tax charge. We expect the tax rate for the full year to be approximately 30%.","Shifting to the balance sheet. Fluor had cash and marketable securities of $3 billion at the end of the third quarter, which is an increase of about $400 million from the previous quarter.","Cash flow from operating activities was $470 million in the third quarter, driven mainly by earning sources and lower working capital, including accounts receivable collections.","As we've discussed in the past, we look at our actual cash balance on a daily basis and cash moved up as we approach the end of the quarter. Despite some reductions in the balance since quarter-end, based on our current view of cash flows for the balance of the year, we plan to repurchase between $200 million and $400 million worth of shares over the next several months. These amounts fall within the 11.8 million share balance available under the existing board repurchase authorization.","I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2013 and 2014, which is on Slide 7 -- Slide 9, excuse me. Based on strong year-to-date results, we are narrowing our guidance for 2013 to a range of $3.90 to $4.10 per share from our previous range of $3.85 to $4.20 per share.","For 2014, we're establishing our initial EPS guidance at a range of $4.10 to $4.60 per share. This guidance reflects our expectation for double-digit profit growth in the Oil & Gas and Power segments, partially offset by the expected declines in the Mining & Metals business and the Industrial & Infrastructure segment and continued reductions in LOGCAP IV task order volume in the Government segment.","During 2013, we benefited from a number of favorable project closeouts, particularly in Industrial & Infrastructure. Excluding those, we are seeing I&I's underlying quarterly earnings come down in line with revenue reductions. As a result, we expect our quarterly EPS in 2014 to start at a lower level and gradually recover throughout the year with stronger earnings in the second half than the first half. Overall, we anticipate flattish revenues in 2014 at a consolidated level but with an improving margin profile.","Guidance for 2014 assumes that G&A expense will be in a range of $170 million to $180 million and effective tax rate of 32% to 33%. Guidance for 2014 also includes some benefit from our expected share repurchases that I mentioned earlier.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","David, so total backlog has been dropping over the last year plus, obviously, because of mining. Do you think that over the next year -- you talked about prospects over the next year, 1.5 years in Oil & Gas. Do you think that those prospects can get Fluor to reverse that trend and start rising again, total backlog? And then what's your conviction level that Oil & Gas backlog can rise and get close to its previous peak that you did in '08, low 20s, during this current cycle?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'll take those in reverse order. I've got great confidence that over the next year, 1.5 years, that Oil & Gas will return to that level or larger. The question gets to be is what's the headroom -- I mean, sort of the headwind that we've got from the shutdown of some of the mining projects in the near term. I've remarked that mining, like Mark Twain said, mining is not dead, regardless of what people say. So there's a lot of opportunity there. We're kind of retooling our offering there and I think we'll be greatly successful. But if you think about our revenue profile over the last, I don't know, probably 2 years, it's been heavily impacted by the mining burns. So we've burnt a lot more, so that curve's declining more quickly than the curve on E&C new awards picked up. So on balance, we're kind of expecting a little bit flattish, if not a little bit up, in '14. But I think what I'm more excited about is the improving margin in that backlog and our ability to drive more profitability to the bottom line. But I really am bullish about E&C. You've heard us use the word lumpy in the past. There's some really, really large projects that are going to be decided over the next little while. And we feel good about what we're going to be putting in the backlog, but it's going to take time because they're so much larger and they're having to go back to their boards one more quarter and have these decisions made. But I'm very bullish on where Oil & Gas is and I feel confident that they can eclipse the former high.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. That's helpful, David. I'll let Jamie ask the question about [indiscernible]. I want to ask you about I&I margin. In the context of -- I know you said in your Q that there are progress on 2 infrastructure projects. Obviously, one of them is probably Bay Bridge. But when you look at the 5% margin you did in the quarter, maybe Biggs could quantify for us what the impact of these progress milestone payments were. And then as you look at the '14, do you think high 4s or 5% is achievable given the mix change that you're going to have?","Biggs C. Porter","Well, I think, Andy, you look at the third quarter, certainly, the margin rate was higher than it has run and it's higher than what we would expect going forward because of the significant pickup on a few projects. The run rate earlier in the year was the low 4%. Given the mix changes occurring, I think going forward, it's probably going to be closer to the prior run rate than it will be to that 5%. But a lot will depend quarter-to-quarter on the maturity of different projects. And when we hit milestones, as projects either hit those milestones or complete, it does enable a fair amount of profit recognition for performing well. But they're not always smooth across the quarters. And going into next year, we don't see quite the same frequency of opportunity in that regard that we saw this year and has particularly showed up in the third quarter.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Barclays Capital, Research Division","Okay. So, Biggs, is it fair to say, though, that the underlying margin is still sort of in the low 4s, but that underlying margin could be rising a little bit as you go through the quarters in 2014 given the mix change? Is that how we should think about it?","Biggs C. Porter","I don't want to get too much specific than I already got by saying, yes, I think, going forward, it's going to be more like what we experienced the last few quarters, but it can move around. And so it's going to be tough to model on a quarter-to-quarter basis. And a lot will depend upon how projects progress next year.","Operator","We'll go next to Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","David, can you flesh out the magnitude of the infrastructure projects that you're pursuing from here and just, if you don't mind, step us through the timing of final investment decisions on those?","David T. Seaton","They're mostly road. They're mostly in the United States. There are probably 3 to go to bid in early '14. And I'm not sure I want to get any more specific than that, but we do see a number of infrastructure-type programs. I think what you're seeing is the thirst for the PPP model, Public-Private Partnership model, I think, is only going to increase. And I think there's few people as well-positioned as we are to participate in those.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And within your Chemicals franchise and nice award this quarter, can you just update us on upcoming final investment decisions? How many do you think happened over the next 6 months for ethylene and propylene contracts? And then on the back-end, once you're done with the work, what's the opportunity set for follow-on work on derivative contracts once you have the main facilities built?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'm really pleased. Thank you for that question because I'm really excited about that. As many of you know, I spend a lot of my career in that part of our business. Obviously, we've got 2 underway, CPChem and Dow. Those were nearly early stages, obviously. And some of those downstream derivatives will be awarded later. We feel pretty good about our position on those projects. We're in the process of completing the FEED on Sasol. My expectation is there's a funding decision sometime early next year, at least by the second -- by the middle of the year. And that's the first, I think, piece of their investment there. Right behind it, you've got the gas-to-liquids programs that we're pursuing and have done some work on already. I think they're -- they, basically, have sequenced them such that you won't have the huge peak in the craft manpower requirement that we were worried about, frankly, a year ago. But there's Shell and there's Sasol and I think there's some other related projects. And then I mentioned the LNG projects. If you listened to my comments probably a year ago, I had those backwards. I thought that the gas-to-liquids would go before the LNG plants. And I'm pleased that I'm incorrect because those projects are pretty large and are pretty mature in their development. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're in competition for those projects. But we feel pretty good about our position and our ability to deliver for those customers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","And because Andy set me up, David, you're not off the hook.","David T. Seaton","Oh come on now.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","I guess, Dave, look, we're sitting here again, it's a year later and your margins have been hovering in the high 3s. And I guess, in the context of you saying margin should improve next year, how do we think about Oil & Gas margins, in particular, as you're willing to take on some projects that have more fixed-price exposure, which, in my opinion, says you should be looking for a higher margin because of the risk associated with that? So, I guess, that's my first question. And then, I guess, my second question, I don't know if it's for you or for Biggs. Biggs, you mentioned earnings first half versus second half. It sounds like second half should be better. Can you give color on that? And I guess, at what point -- I think investors are sitting here saying, \"You imply earnings growth at the midpoint, about 6%. Why aren't we growing double digit?\" And, I mean, could we get to grow more meaningful growth in the back half of the year just with the dynamics of Mining rolling off and LOGCAP, et cetera?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'll start on the last one and then go to your first question, ask Biggs to give color on the other. As I said, we're in a declining curve on the Mining projects. At the same time, we've got an inclining curve on Oil & Gas and it's just not as mature enough to show the kind of percentage growth that, I think, that you're suggesting. But I believe it's clearly in front of us. With regard to your first question in the margin, I think you're going to continue to see margin in our Oil & Gas segment continue to rise every quarter over the next little while. But I'd caution you because a lot of those projects are fixed-price and they're going to have a different curve than the refining boom that we enjoyed in the last cycle where there was pretty steady growth quarter-over-quarter. It's going to look like a lot of the patterns of some of the Industrial & Infrastructure programs, where a lot of the profitability will fall out when we've mitigated the risk or passed that risk and have the ability to drop more profitability to the bottom line.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","But, David -- sorry. Go ahead.","David T. Seaton","But, clearly, we expect in that backlog to have significantly better backlog on those fixed-price projects than we saw in the refining boom a few years ago.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So wait, you said better margin in backlog, so that would imply for sort of the first time you're thinking we could approach prior peak margins in Oil & Gas, or it's before you can play that down?","David T. Seaton","You said that, I didn't.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. So you said we can get the prior peak margins?","David T. Seaton","I think we have the ability over time -- and I'm talking about the back-end of next year and as we get into '15 and even into '16 -- that we will get back to those peak margins in Oil & Gas.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Okay. That's great. And then, sorry, just, Biggs, just help me with the second half, first half earnings, just so we don't screw things up over here.","Biggs C. Porter","Okay. I guess, first of all, on the year-over-year, I think the midpoint of our guidance to '13, the midpoint of the guidance '14 is about 9% year-over-year. Maybe I've got the calculation wrong, but that's what I came up with. But in terms of the trend, just using the midpoint of our guidance for this year, it would suggest a little bit lower fourth quarter as a result of some of the strong performance in Infrastructure, not necessarily repeating itself in the fourth quarter, and the Government business declining a little bit more in the fourth quarter over the third. So that gives us a little bit lower run rate going into next year by itself. And then we expect it to pick up as we go through the year, as the Oil & Gas business continues to develop. And it's mix engineering and other content matters beyond just the one of what's the mix from, a fixed-price or reimbursable standpoint. So from a combination of effects, we expect it to grow over the course of next year as the I&Is and Government sort of moderate over the next couple of quarters and then Oil & Gas starts to develop.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So declines in first half, growth in the second half? I'm sorry.","Biggs C. Porter","Yes. So our decline here in the fourth quarter...","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","Yes. And then in the first half...","Biggs C. Porter","Turning over and then picking up from there. Turning over to the first quarter next year and then picking up from there, gradually.","Jamie L. Cook - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division","So each quarter should see better growth sequentially?","Biggs C. Porter","Probably, yes, slight growth, second over the first and then sharper to the second half. But a lot will depend upon the kind of things that we always talk about, of how projects progress, how they mature, how we are able to increase our booking rates based upon hitting milestones and those kinds of things. So pretty subjective to get too finite about it, but the general trend would be that we fall off a little bit in the fourth quarter, stay down in the first and then move up over time.","David T. Seaton","Jamie, I applaud you, you're the first one that's gotten guidance within the guidance.","Operator","Our next question comes from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Just curious to get your thoughts on how we should think about LOGCAP and the decline of revenues in that investment next year.","David T. Seaton","Yes. I mean, LOGCAP, you read the papers just like I do. I mean, the U.S. military is pulling -- exercising the drawdown differently and more expediently than they did in Iraq. And as I said, we expect to go from $1.6 billion to probably $1 billion next year in revenue on LOGCAP. I will say that it's still strong and we think it will, quite frankly, extend beyond '14. But I would point you to the way the Government group -- I think it's been announced that we won the U.S. strategic petroleum reserve. So they've been really focused on growing their business and diversifying that business. And we feel pretty good about that being a pretty stable business, even though it will be down year-on-year because of how big LOGCAP is.","Vishal Shah - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. Great. And then just overall in terms of the GTL FEED activity. Can you talk a little bit about a timing of that and when you expect to start to see some of that activity?","David T. Seaton","I think the FEED activity will start to pick up as we get into next year, probably the second half. We've done some of the preliminary stuff on a couple of those projects. But I think kind of the truth, active FEED and then the EPC is back half, half of '14 and into '15.","Operator","We'll go next to Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","Just going back to I&I and Pascua-Lama, the news that we heard today. I just want to make sure, are you assuming that there's no revenue contribution in 2014 and you're still keeping it in the backlog? Is that the way to think about it?","David T. Seaton","There will be some revenue on it. We've got to wind the project down effectively. I mean, there's only 2 months left in this project. We did the water management program for them to help them with their permitting situation. That is not complete. So there'll be some in early '14 as we take that project down, but clearly, it's a chunk of work that comes out of our earnings stream. But it's a suspension, not a cancellation. As I said, I feel confident that we'll be a participant in that phased approach when they start that project back up. Which they said probably won't be until maybe some of the planning work as we get into '14, but certainly '15. And that's when I expect the Mining business will pick up again in general, in early '15.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And secondly, on new scale, so we're still waiting for the DOE to make its -- to determine who the other participants are. Obviously, there's been some delays, I assume, within that decision-making progress. Maybe -- process. Can you give us an update on how you see that unfolding? And is there an assumption that there's some sell-down in the stake in '14?","David T. Seaton","There is an assumption to sell down in stake in '14. I mean, the government promised us that they were going to tell us in August. It was a successful FOA recipient, whether it's 1 or 2. All indications are based on our proposal and the questions that have been asked, that we're being seriously considered for one of those. And just like most things with government right now, we're just waiting and seeing, but it doesn't change much of our strategy. But clearly, we're turning down spending to match what's necessary to meet the NRC requirements in our proposal.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners, LLC","And so there's an assumption that your spending in '14 does decline based on your sell-down assumption? Can you provide that?","David T. Seaton","Yes, but I'm not going to quantify it.","Operator","We'll go next to Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","First question is really in regards to what you talked about, David, and as you put yourself on the spot by saying it's really near and dear to your heart, which is why the petrochem work. Clearly, you've done pretty much close to a clean sweep in all the EPCs and some of the FEEDs that have come out on the ethane cracker side. Could you talk a bit about, perhaps, your sort of third-generation modular technology and processes and how much of a role they've really played in winning some of this work as opposed to really slow going out and bidding aggressively?","David T. Seaton","We spend a lot of time and effort in improving our systems and tools and utilizing more of a modular design approach in this way than in past ways for 2 primary reasons. One, we think that we have improved our design process to the point where we're actually lowering the cost of facilities. The second is we had a -- obviously, a fear of an overheated craft market, and we wanted the ability to take part of that off of the job site into a more controlled environment, thus, improving schedule and quality. So we've been able to affect that. And I think it has had a positive effect on our competitive stance on those projects. There's 4 in North America. We won 3, and we're disappointed we didn't win the fourth. But I think that we've got a competitive advantage now in how we are implementing our design tools and how that results in a much more efficient supply chain opportunity but also more efficient construction approach.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And the second question is really in regards to some of your international opportunities. I know there's a lot of excitement around North America. But when I look at my database, I see you being on the forefront of a couple of fairly large upstream opportunities, even in the Middle East. I would love to get an idea of really looking outside of the U.S., what you think are really exciting opportunities for you from a backlog standpoint into next year.","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we'll start with the Middle East. There's a lot of projects coming, both upstream and downstream, that we're pursuing and feel pretty good about in refining market. Kuwait is an example. The clean fuels programs or the bids are under development as we speak. I'm not optimistic that the fourth refinery will actually be bid until late next year, if not into '15. But those programs have been on kind of a quiet phase for quite some time. But we're very active in the proposal steps on the clean fuels piece of that. We're very bullish on the upstream market, particularly with the ADMA-OPCO, Parvana, in the UAE. We continue to win front-end work with them relative to gas processing, and I think that we'll see some success there. So the Middle East, in general, I think, just 2 places, give us great optimism for growth outside the United States. Kazakhstan, the continuing on TCO, the next phase is there, we feel very good about, as well as some of the major pipeline programs that are there in Russia and Kazakhstan and the former Soviet Union. In China, there is a fair amount of refining work. And again, we've been able to participate in that. We are one of the few -- I think we're the only Western contractor that has our own design license and our own construction license. So that gives us competitive advantage in China. But we're also seeing opportunities in places like Singapore and other places in Southeast Asia in the refining sector that are quite optimistic. Australia continues to go. I'm not sure when this next phase of Santos will go, but we feel pretty good about finishing that -- the first phase of that project on time and feel good about the next phases. So ending in Canada, we're really excited about the gas in the States, but Canada, the refinery there continuing work in the oil sands, I think we've made some step change in our skill set and the people we have around SAGD. And some of those programs are in their early stages. So all that together, I mean, I'm really bullish about what Oil & Gas group can do over the next 3 to 5 years, frankly. And I think that with some of the improvements I mentioned in our tools and systems and how we go about projects and taking more of a direct hire and controlling some of the fabrication, I think it gives us a competitive advantage, and I see great headroom in that part of our business.","Operator","We'll go next to Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","David, you talked about those increasing fixed -- number of fixed-price projects. How much risk are you willing to put in the backlog at this point? And then has your perspective changed on that as things in the marketplace had been a bit slower than expected?","David T. Seaton","I wouldn't say it changed the slowness. I mean, we kind of anticipated it. Because these projects are getting so large, there's a little bit longer gestation period on them. So that's not a surprise. On the lump-sum piece, I'll answer 2 ways. One, we've been as high as 45%, 50% of our backlog in fixed-price, primarily in the days when we were doing a lot of the Power work. But because of that Power work and that experience, we've been able to transfer some of that knowledge over to our Oil & Gas business, that kind of is the underpinning of our confidence of being able to deliver more lump-sum in Oil & Gas, which is supported by the improvement in tools and systems that I spoke of in Tahira's question. So we're still, what, less than 20% fixed-price. There's great headroom in our comfort in moving that number north. But I'm much more confident in our execution capability today than I have been in some time, and it's because we have invested in those tools and systems and we have been successful in moving people around that have that expertise. So I feel pretty good about our position of being able to not only be competitive but to deliver the profitability that's expected.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then for Biggs, what opportunities do you foresee in 2014 to repatriate any of your international cash? And then do you anticipate just generally generating more U.S. cash next year?","Biggs C. Porter","As far as the first question goes, we really can't repatriate today without too much tax consequence. The cash that we see as being really not readily available is the cash which is either tied up in joint ventures or for which it's in a form of a customer advance tied to a specific project. That's why we have a tendency to most carve out and say we really can't use that for operating purposes outside of specific projects to which they're tied and that we don't count on from the standpoint of having the kind of cushion we need to have for liquidity. So although there can be some inefficiency with international, we have taken into consideration that it's not the big driver of what we have available. The big driver is what was tied to projects, JVs and what's the amount of liquidity we just feel like we need to maintain. Do think that with the growth in domestic business and the increase in the backlog evidencing that, that we will see more cash generation domestically. However, as I said, that's not necessarily a big driver of our redeployment considerations, it's more a matter of do we have excess liquidity beyond $1 billion or $1.5 billion cushion that we feel like we need to have and are there any other better investment opportunities. If there aren't better investment opportunities and after we have continuously satisfied our dividend commitments or chosen increase, and then that's when we look to share repurchase.","Operator","We'll go next to Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","David, 2 quick questions. First, on the LNG space in North America, a little bit bigger picture. You're quite involved now these days. How much room you think there are in North America, including Canada, even maybe a longer-term project that could happen in Alaska, I hear from one of your customers, do you foresee? And is Fluor positioned to take a lot more than we see right now or are you comfortable with your positioning?","David T. Seaton","I'm pretty comfortable with our positioning, and we want to make sure that we're focused on the ones that are going to happen the quickest. I think that there is a lot of growth for us. I mean, I'm very happy with our relationship with JGC. I work with JGC for at least since the early '90s on different programs. I have great respect for their capability. And the relationship that we've created there actually makes us part of that club and that's a part -- that's a club we haven't been -- haven't had access to. So I feel really good about where we are, I feel good about the competitive bids that we've put in on the 2 that the bids were actually active, including the fact that we're one of the FEED contractors on Mozambique. I think that there's a challenge on Mozambique from a timing standpoint, but notwithstanding that, I still feel good about our position to continue to participate in that program. I think when you think about the whole gas play, in my previous comments, I thought petrochemicals would go first, which it has. I thought LNG would be last, which is not. And I think the question gets to be is at what point does the supply -- the demand start to outstrip supply and what happens to gas prices. I don't think we're going to see dramatic rise. But LNG is a global commodity and I don't know why the U.S. would look at that any differently than the rest of the world. I think that the flows are going to change relative to who gets what flows around the world. But I feel pretty good about our position and we're going to take this one -- one project at a time and make sure that we can execute that project with excellence and deliver the profitability. I mean, they're big programs, big projects. We've got a partner that we're dealing with, that we're happy with. So I feel pretty good about where we are.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee & Leach Inc., Research Division","And just a quick follow-up, David, on Power. A likelihood of 1 or 2 similar type bookings in 2014 than what we witnessed there in Virginia?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we're continuing to work on the front-end to several gas-fired power plants. If the economy continues to improve in the United States, you're going to see an improving demand in electricity usage. At the same time, once we get the environmental regulations and rules exacted from the EPA and otherwise, I think there's going to be a demand. Whether it's -- when it is in '14 or whether it even moves in '15, I really -- I have no clue right now based on what's going to happen with the regs. But I feel good about our position and the fact Bear -- or the Dominion project is up and running -- I mean, up and off to a good start from an execution standpoint. So our ability to prove that we can execute is clear.","Operator","We'll go next to Andrew Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","David, I just want to kind of dig into the earnings cadence as we move into '14 a little bit more. How much of the bookings -- or how much visibility through bookings that are already on the books are in place today that gives you confidence with the earnings ramp as we go through '14? In other words, how much is there today versus what needs to be won to get that second half acceleration?","David T. Seaton","Well, 2 comments. I know I'm going to regret my comment about the Giants at some point in the near term. Secondly, the fact that Jamie got Biggs to give you guidance within a guidance gives you an answer that we feel pretty good about profile of EPS as it goes through the quarters next year. We feel pretty good and have great visibility into how we're going to get there.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Just in terms of the buyback coming out of the last quarter. It sounded like you're pretty confident that you wanted to kind of use the timing in the cash flow. The cash flows in the quarter were pretty good. Yet you didn't buy stock. Was there something that changed in the quarter about the way you viewed the capital allocation? Or can you just kind of take us through the process, why nothing happened in this quarter? In the near term, you're saying you'd come back and do this now. So I'm just wondering, kind of, was there a change in the thought process in the last 3, 6 months, how you're looking at buyback and cash flow?","Biggs C. Porter","There's really been no change in our philosophy. As I said in my comments, the cash built up towards the end of the quarter and we have a pretty good view towards just staying high or cash generation being good through the rest of this year. So it just was an ample trigger to go ahead and commit. So I think rather than spending a lot of time on what the -- all the circumstances were of the last quarter, last few quarters, I focused more about the fact that we've stepped out and made a commitment that we're going to spend $204 million over the next several months.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","And then maybe the last question here is just talking about labor utilization, knowing that there is eventually going to be a substantial ramp. And David, you've been pretty outspoken about thoughts about constraints on labor. Can you just talk about where you are today on that and how much the floor model has in terms of leverage from underutilization, if could go to well-utilized labor in the next quarter or 2, and what that could mean to your margins? Can you just give us some context about where your people are being built today?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think in addition to my comments about the tools and systems, we also, I think, have perfected the dispersed execution models, where we have greater capacity because instead of taking Houston to 5,000 people, again, we can grow the entire portfolio and be effective in how we do design. And that's the designs side and the project management side. So we feel pretty good about our ability to scale this thing up quite a bit in the near term and over the long term to serve as the Oil & Gas boom. But also, it's kind of retooling our organization with some pretty talented folks. And I'm really pleased it's where we stand there. From the craft side, we've invested in training programs and in Texas and Louisiana so that we can get a head start on that craft. We do believe that we're an employer of choice in that marketplace. And early indications are, based on -- in our past and the fact that we are a direct-hire constructor, I think what we've seen in terms of interest in those training programs, interest in getting lined up for the projects that we already have going on, like Dow, Freeport and some other things, we feel pretty good about our ability to scale the craft resources as well. If you think about the petrochemical boom, we're the -- we've got the first 3 of the big programs in Louisiana and Texas. So we'll be the first one staffing those people and have that following that we're going to need to continue as we get into the bigger projects in LNG, gas-to-liquids and power and some of the other programs that are out there for us in the southeastern region of the United States. So I feel pretty good about our position and I feel pretty good about our ability to kind of turn the crank here and get the people we need to be successful.","Biggs C. Porter","I might just add. You asked about labor. But certainly, as you look at not just labor but nonlabor components of our overhead costs, as E&C ramps up, there will be benefits to their margins from increased leverage, I guess, overhead. So it will be a contributor. We have -- as David said, we have the labor capacity and ability to grow across the world, but from an overhead standpoint, there will be improved leverage as well contributing.","Operator","We'll go next to Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Markets.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Two quick questions. David or Biggs, maybe you can identify 1 or 2 sort of primary variables that could result in earnings of either $4.10 or $4.60. And then I have a follow-up.","David T. Seaton","Why don't we move to your follow-up? That would be guidance within the guidance.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Well, if I could expand upon that a little bit, do you think it's the timing of certain projects or do you think it's sort of the margin profile of what's in backlog and how that comes through the P&L?","David T. Seaton","I think it's more timing, more than anything else. Clearly, things like Pascua-Lama and the headwind that, that presents is included in that range. But barring any more cancellations, I feel good about where we are in the visibility again and to how we're going to get there. But I think between the low and the highs, it's clearly a timing element.","Alexander J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co., Research Division","Okay. And secondly, if we were to exclude Pascua-Lama, because I think we all understand what's going on there, any other sizable projects that were canceled or delayed in the quarter?","David T. Seaton","No.","Operator","We'll go next to John Rogers with D.A. Davidson.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","I just wanted to touch a little bit on plans for and uses of cash. I mean, I appreciate the plans to step up the repurchases, but when you generated a lot -- $470 million in the quarter, you're holding a lot of cash. David, any thoughts there on this cycle, some reasons that you have to hold more going into it or just waiting for the right opportunity?","David T. Seaton","Well, I mean, as Biggs said, I don't think our strategy or how we think of this has changed. I think when you look at the headwinds that were there around a government shutdown and all of the challenges that we've seen in front of us, I think it was prudent to kind of -- to wait and see. I think there's a lot of uncertainty out there. And I believe that having a healthy cash balance allows us to do what we need to do to prepare to grow. I don't think there's any magic in why it's a fourth quarter, first quarter buying bench, if you will. But I think that as we go through next year, you'll see a more normal buyback process because we do think that we're going to generate excess cash over what we think we need, which I appreciate is a different number than what you guys think we ought to have.","John B. Rogers - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","All right. And are you still of the mind that you're better off building capabilities than buying them?","David T. Seaton","Well, I think we've proven that we know how to grow organically pretty well and we have great control over that. I do believe that there are some weaknesses and maybe some holes in our current offering from a market perspective and from a geographic perspective. And we're going to look to see how we fill those holes. And I think that some acquisitive growth mentioned in its makeup is something that we've got to consider pretty directly as we get into '14.","Operator","We'll go next to George O'Leary with Tudor, Pickering.","George O'Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","Just a quick follow-up on that last question. Maybe some of the areas that you're considering or some of the holes that you're considering, what, I guess, segments would those fall into?","David T. Seaton","Well, I'd say across the board. I mean, we've got a good position in all the markets that we're in, but we can always get better. And I think that there's some room in our Oil & Gas offering and the upstream piece that would be helpful. Also, I think there's room in our government offering based on some of the changes that we're seeing. I think there's also opportunity when we think about infrastructure. But what that means and what shape that takes, I think that I'd caution you with our conservatism and the fact that we grow organically pretty well. And, again, because I believe we're an employer of choice, we got the ability to go get the critical people we need pretty readily and then build from there.","George O'Leary - Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Securities, Inc., Research Division","All right. And then last question for me. With Cameron and Kitimat both coming up, I think the expectations so that both of those projects kind of hit in the first half of next year and, potentially, Q1 of '14, I guess, first, are you kind of onboard with that timeline? And then, second, how do you feel you guys are in the running for the KBR project, given there's -- sorry, for the Kitimat project, given there's a couple of bidders there?","David T. Seaton","Thank you for that correction. That would be a new something I didn't know. I wouldn't -- I feel really good about our position. Basically, it's -- we're competing against one other consortium in both cases. I feel really good about where we stand on both of them. I'm not sure that I agree that both will hit in the first half of next year. I think one will and I think one will push out later in the year.","Operator","We'll take our final question from Robert Connors with Stifel, Nicolaus.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","With the receivables coming down and the government mix dissipating, do you see the opportunity that -- I know you gave your EPS guidance range, but that the operating cash flow in 2014 could be a little bit higher than that range.","Biggs C. Porter","For the government, I mean, it's a very steady payer. But certainly, on the Government business, as revenues come down, there should be less tied up in working capital, that's true. Of course, on the E&C side, we've got growing activities and so that's going to take some working capital. I think all in all, the relationship between working capital and revenues should be largely the same 2014 as 2013. But I just have to caution everybody. When you have very large projects, there could be some very significant payments that come in, that could come in the day before the end of a quarter and the cash balance goes up; and they come in a day later when the cash balance goes down. So if while we look at it on a day-to-day basis and see what's happening and so you have some volatility quarter-to-quarter, but looking at it on sort of a normalized run rate basis, we'd expect a similar relationship between working capital and revenue next year, as this year, as I said.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","I may have missed it, but where you think corporate G&A shakes out for 2013?","Biggs C. Porter","Right. I guided, I think, to $170 million to $180 million.","Robert V. Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. Or for 2013?","Biggs C. Porter","I'm sorry, I gave 2014. I didn't give a distinct number for 2013.","Operator","And gentlemen, that was our final question. So I'll turn it back to you for any closing remarks.","David T. Seaton","Thank you, operator. And thanks to everyone participating on the call this afternoon. I appreciate your interest in our company.","As I think I've expressed, I feel pretty good about our financial performance so far this year, particularly given the short falloff that we've seen in the Mining & Metals market. Our Oil & Gas and Power and Infrastructure businesses have all performed well and are delivering, I think, strong growth in '13. Importantly, the Oil & Gas segment has been very successful, as we've said, in capturing the key awards during the year that we signaled in positioning ourselves quite well for substantial new awards and as we get to '14 and beyond. I want to reiterate that we think that we're in the early stages, early innings, if you will, of a substantial multi-year Oil & Gas investment cycle and our market position and prospects for growth are extremely strong. And I think our outlook is very positive.","We greatly appreciate your interest in Fluor and your confidence in our company. And I wish everyone a safe Halloween and a good day.","Operator","Thank you. This does conclude today's program. You may disconnect at any time and have a great day."],"9452":["Fluor Corp.

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow management's presentation.","A replay of today's conference call will be available at approximately 8:30 P.M. Eastern Time today, accessible on Fluor's website at investor.fluor.com. The web replay will be available for 30 days. A telephone replay will also be available through 7:30 P.M. Eastern Time on November 9th at the following telephone number, 888-203-1112 and the pass code of 4869593 will be required.","At this time, for opening remarks, I'd like to turn the call over to Mr. Geoff Telfer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.","Geoff Telfer - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, Deedee, and welcome to Fluor's third quarter 2017 conference call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Stanski, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after market close, and we've posted a slide presentation on our website which we'll reference while making prepared remarks.","But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of the existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences, in the company's Form 10-Q filed earlier today and our Form 10-K filed on February 17.","During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now, let me turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Jeff. Good afternoon, everyone, and I appreciate everybody joining us today. On the call, we'll review our results for the third quarter and discuss our views of the market. If you turn to slide 3, let's look at the results for the third quarter. Net earnings attributable to Fluor were $94 million or $0.67 per diluted share. Our consolidated segment profit for the third quarter was $203 million, and segment profit margin was 4.1%.","Revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, compared to $4.8 million a year ago. New awards for the quarter were $3.8 billion. And ending backlog stood at $32.9 billion, with both of the nuclear projects having been removed from that backlog number.","If you'll turn to slide 4, the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked $2.6 billion in new awards for the quarter, including a number of petrochemical projects, mostly in Malaysia, the Philippines and the United States. Ending backlog for Energy Chemicals & Mining segment was $18.5 billion.","We continue to see a ramp up in mining, with the award of BHP Spence copper project in Chile. Based on what our clients are asking from us in terms of feasibility studies and FEED work, we believe that we're at the start of the next commodity cycle. This includes commodities such as copper, gold, as well as replacement mines for iron ore.","Our oil and gas customers continue to focus on projects that are advantaged; meaning, they have a clear and distinct economic profile in the current commodity pricing environment. As we look at Q4 and into 2018, we see clients pursuing final investment decisions on chemical facilities and pipeline projects in the United States, LNG projects in North America, as well as refining and chemical projects in the Middle East and Asia. As we look into 2018, we anticipate an increase in front-end engineering awards, which as you know, has been at a trough level for the last two years. Third quarter awards for industrial infrastructure and power were $628 million, and ending backlog was $8.1 billion.","During the quarter, we brought ground on the Maryland Purple Line project, a 16-mile light rail project that is leveraging our P3 experience from the Denver Eagle Commuter Rail Project we completed last year. We also hit a significant milestone in August, opening the first span of the Mario M. Cuomo Bridge in New York, which was formerly known as the Tappan Zee Bridge. All traffic has been shifted to the first span allowing us to focus on the second span, which we expect to complete sometime in 2018.","I'm pleased to report we made solid progress on the three gas-fired power plants we're currently executing and remain on track to complete two of those projects in the first part of next year with the final project to be completed in late 2018.","Turn to slide 5. Diversified Services segment posted third quarter new awards of $338 million including new contracts to provide operation support services in Colombia and asset integrity services in the North Sea. Ending backlog was $2.7 billion. The Government group posted third quarter new awards of $234 million. And ending backlog was $3.6 billion, compared to $5.9 billion a year ago.","During the quarter, we announced that we were successful on our bid for the base operating support services contract in Guam, which will be taken into backlog early next year.","Before I turn the call over to Bruce, I'd like to address the impacts that we've seen in hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria. And as you know, we have a number of employees, offices and projects in the affected areas. Recovery efforts will continue for years and we are doing our part to support our employees and those clients.","And finally, two weeks ago, we announced that we were awarded a contract from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to help restore electric power to Puerto Rico as a result of Hurricane Maria. We've been called upon to work in disaster stricken locations for decades, and we're proud to play an initial role in restoring a sense of normalcy to the people of Puerto Rico.","With that, I'll turn it over to Bruce. Bruce?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 6 of your presentation. I'll start by providing some additional comments on our third quarter performance, and then I'll move on to the balance sheet. As David just said, revenue for the quarter was $4.9 billion, up slightly from $4.7 billion last quarter and $4.8 billion a year ago. Revenue improvements in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment are being driven by the mining and metals business line as we start to execute on recent awards.","Corporate G&A expense for the third quarter was $46 million, compared to $47 million last quarter.","Shifting to the balance sheet where cash plus current and non-current marketable securities for the quarter was $2.1 billion, flat with last quarter and a year ago. Cash provided by operating activities was $123 million for the quarter and $551 million year-to-date. During the quarter, we paid $29 million in dividends.","Moving on to slide 7. Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter-end was $32.9 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 36%, compared to 29% a year-ago, when we had two large reimbursable nuclear projects in our backlog. A quarter-end, the mix by geography was 40%, U.S. and 60% non-U.S.","I'll conclude my remarks today by commenting on our guidance for 2017, which is on slide 8. We're revising and tightening our earnings guidance range to $1.50 to $1.60 per diluted share. And, finally, I want to mention one housekeeping item as we look ahead to 2018. Some people have asked me about the change in accounting for construction based contracts.","Starting January 1st, Fluor will be required to report under the new revenue recognition standard. Under existing guidance, the company's segments revenue and margin recognition between the engineering and construction phases of our contracts. Upon adoption of the new standard, the company expects that the entire engineering and construction contract will be a single performance obligation, which will result in less volatility and recognition of revenue and margin over the term of the contract.","We won't know the full effect of this new standard until we know what our mix of business will be at the end of the year. As such, we're delaying 2018 guidance until we report full year 2017 results. While we won't know the full impact until the year is concluded, the economic drivers of the business remain unchanged. For fourth quarter 2017 and going into 2018, we expect our tax rate to be in the range of 34% to 36%, and G&A expense to be approximately $50 million a quarter depending on currency fluctuation and share price. NuScale expenses are expected to be approximately $75 million in 2018.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And we'll go to our first question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good evening, guys. It's Alan calling on for Andy.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Okay. How are you?","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Good. David, outside of your award for TCO, this is the best aggregate bookings result we've seen in ECM since I think the second half of 2015 and you did it with fairly broad-based strength in mining and oil and gas. So I think the tendency to think that has made market potential turn here and customers moving forward with larger project decisions. I mean do you think that's a fair way to kind of look at it? And does this give you more confidence and backlog starting to turn higher for good here?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","That's a great question. And I'm cautiously optimistic. I mean I've been bitten over the last five quarters on certain things continuing to be shifted right on the schedule. But this does kind of give us some optimism that the trough is the trough and we're starting to come out of it. I think the quality of the projects that are coming up are really intriguing to us in terms of mining, as well as some of the projects that the oil and gas guys are finally taking to FID. So I guess the short answer is, I'm cautiously optimistic that we're in the beginning of the recovery.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. I appreciate that. And maybe, David, you can talk about how we should think about ECM margin going forward. I think over the last several quarters you pointed to the lack of engineering utilization, as you said, as being a drag on margin performance. But you did book some sizable engineering awards this quarter and CPChem is rolling off. So do you think we should start to see maybe a more significant inflection in margin heading into 2018, and maybe talk about how mining plays into that?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I'm really not going to give any guidance. I would just say that, you're correct in that there's more of an engineering component at least coming in right now. But I would remind you what Bruce said around the new rev rec model. So I think what you're going to see is, two things: we still are seeing improved margin in terms of backlog, but I think what you're going to see is a more smooth take-up in terms of that margin over the longer term with the new regs.","Alan Fleming - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you. I'll hand it over.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, David and team. Congrats on being back on track.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So listening to your customer calls, it does seem cautiously optimistic, make sense. I know in the past you've been more positive on petrochem, seems like you're getting more positive on mining. How about LNG, any change in thoughts over there?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, there's some big projects out there that we're pursuing. We'll see how quickly they move forward. I think there's one or two that'll probably be \u2013 will reach FID in 2018. And then, we'll see what goes from there. But I think you're correct. I mean, we're continue to see strength in petrochemicals globally, as well as refining. And again, as I said in the prepared remarks, it's pretty diverse in terms of geography in that regard. So, again, cautiously optimistic. I've been wrong before, but I listen to the same things you do and talk to those same customers. And there seems to be a little bit more optimism there as well.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. And, David, if you look at the recently advertised Saudi 2030 Vision plan, it seems like probably the most notable plan for infrastructure we've seen in a while. And I was just wondering, is there a way you can leverage your relationships that you've built on the oil and gas side so successfully? Can you leverage them to get a bigger piece of that pie, if you're interested, that is?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, we've always had an infrastructure play there. We're currently managing the heavy-haul rail program for the Saudis and have a fairly sizable project management organization there to do that. We were doing the, before it was canceled, the Doha Crossing project Sharq, which was called Sharq.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We've managed the mass-transit program in the UAE. So I think not only can we leverage the relationships we got, but we also have a pretty good resume to use. I would say that the plans are quite aggressive, but really intriguing to us because they fit within the types of programs that we're interested in. And I had mentioned that there was a power seminar or conference, or whatever you want to call it, this past week there and there was great interest in the presentations that were made on NuScale.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","And I think that that bodes well for where we're going with NuScale. Clearly, if we can get the Saudis to sign the 123 Agreement, that kind of opens the door. The DOE was there and was very complimentary of our progress in terms of the DCA submittal. And we're on track. So I think, to me, those were very positive statements that were made in the Middle East that fit a lot of the things that we're looking at doing.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you very much, David.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Tahira.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Good evening.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good evening.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And it's nice to see a back-to-normal Fluor quarter. Couple questions. One, David, obviously it was nice to see that we didn't have any charges in the quarter. I think you did talk about last quarter trying to decide strategically whether the gas-fired power business made sense for you longer term. So an update there.","My second question, obviously, when I think about sort of green shoots on mining versus your traditional oil and gas business over the next 12 months, which end market has a bigger pipeline in the next 12 months? Is it mining versus energy if you handicap really what you think will go forward? And then, will mining be a lower-margin business like last cycle if we adjust out the accounting? And then, I have a third question for Bruce.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","No. You can't have it, two \u2013 you can only have two.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Oh, come on. I'm complimenting you on the quarter.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, you think one compliment gets you three questions, really?","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah. Come on, it's been a while.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Okay. I'm in a good mood. What's the third one?","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","The third one is, I know you don't want to talk about 2018 guidance, which I'm fine with because we can make our own assumptions on the markets. But of the things we do know, is it fair to just assume as we think about the base for 2017 and we can make whatever assumption we want on the end market or backlog trajectory, is it fair to just adjust out the problem projects? And then, obviously, we have to minus the new projects which come out, which I think is about $0.40. I just want to make sure I have that math right.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I'll let Bruce answer the math questions. But \u2013 let him get under fire a little bit here, this thing is his first official call. You've said basically that mining wasn't our traditional market; I know you didn't mean it that way...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No. I didn't say that. I said over the next 12 months.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","No, I get it.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Which is a bigger opportunity.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","You basically said that only gas was our main market. I would argue that we're very diverse; and mining is just as much a main market as oil and gas. But clearly when you look at where mining was in terms of backlog, say, a year ago versus where it is now, it's growing. But clearly the oil and gas market is going to be a bigger market in the medium-term, more long-term. So I would argue that oil and gas is still going to kind of drive the ship, but I think that's going to be the back half of that 12-month period that you stated.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I think we're going to see some more mining things in the near-term. We're kind of at the trough, like I said, in terms of new awards. And as I mentioned in the last call, I'm not seeing the markets this low for this long in my career. And I do think that there is going to be a bit of a feeding frenzy with some of these projects that need to go forward if these companies are going to make the kind of numbers that they're suggesting. So I used the term cautiously optimistic just because I've been burnt before, but I do think that both oil and gas and mining are picking up. But oil and gas is going to be a bigger piece of the pie. And the first question was?","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Government \u2013 sorry, not government, gas. You said last quarter you were trying to figure out whether it makes sense to stay in it while you make a final division.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We still haven't made a decision. In fact, there are certain projects in that gas market that we're continuing to pursue. But it's not for bids and a cloud of dust and the one that makes the most mistakes wins, which has been that market for some time. Projects that we're looking at are projects that we're helping these owners develop and have an ability to negotiate what the right cost should be.","So we really haven't made our decision. We're still looking at some gas, but it's on a completely different basis than the four projects that we made mistakes on. But we're kind of sticking to our knitting, if you will, in terms of how we're executing and executing against that plan that we used. Just like I think we've done this very well in the past and maybe we've had a couple of hiccups, but selectivity is still the word of choice regardless of market. And I'd say, we've kind of sharpened our, as a management team, sharpened our focus on selectivity. And now, the margin question.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, Jamie. Thanks. When I look at the math as it be, I want to take out the impact of our problem projects here for the year, I get more like $0.89 instead of $0.40.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Well, no, the $0.89 is the problem projects, the $0.40 is the \u2013 we're taking the new projects, like how much does the absence of the new projects hurt 2018. So you would add back to $0.90 or $0.89 and then subtract out to $0.40 because you're going to lose that. Does that make sense, the Westinghouse project?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","That does make sense. And I would say it's directionally correct.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right. Thank you. I appreciate it.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","You can get back in the queue and ask a fourth question, if you like.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Don't tempt me.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we'll hear from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good afternoon.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","And since you're in a good mood, I've got six questions for you. Just kidding.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I should have know that. I thought we X'd him off the queue.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","So starting last quarter, David, you commented that the market environment was the worst in 30 years. That was a pretty strong statement. Now, you're cautiously optimistic. What's kind of changed over the last three months?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, basically, I was talking about the previous time. And I think what I said was that we're starting to see companies move these projects forward, but that it was going to be a back end of 2018 kind of timeframe. I think some of the projects that we were counting on have come through in terms of the schedule. LyondellBasell is probably a great example of where it moved around quarter-to-quarter. And that one actually received funding, and we're moving forward on that one.","There's a couple others that are \u2013 it appears they're going to stop moving and decisions are going to be made. And in most of those cases are projects we're already working on. So I think it's just a timing element. And I think, like I said, I'm not seeing a whole big slog of things happening in the next two quarters. But I think as we go through 2018, we'll end up with a better new award performance in 2018, than we'll have in 2017.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. And then, just a couple of backlog clarifications. What was the roughly $1 billion downward adjustment to the EC&M backlog in the quarter. I didn't see it in the Q, but maybe I missed it. And then, do you have any preliminary expectations for how the new revenue recognition standard is going to affect backlog?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Steve, I'll take that one, if you don't mind.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Sure.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","The $1 billion in our EC&M segment was \u2013 we had to remove CFM, Customer Furnished Materials, from refinery project and a pipeline project. So there were no cancellations in that segment. As far as rev rec from the backlog and the revenue and earnings side, that's what we're evaluating. Again, we'll have a much better understanding as we close out 2017, what the impacts will be on 2018.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And sorry, Bruce, why did you take those things out of your scope?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We no longer had the responsibility for the Client Furnished Material on those two projects. So the risk profile of those contracts diminished. And those two projects, we're still doing the engineering and project management, we're not responsible for the material. So it doesn't flow through our books.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Fair enough. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And next, we'll hear from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi. Good afternoon and good evening. David, you folks often have the best early look at mining opportunities. Can you just flesh out what commodities or regions you're most optimistic about translating into bookings for you folks over the next 12 months? Obviously, mining spans a lot of commodities and markets. If you could just give us any context there, that'd be helpful.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I think certainly copper. You've seen the prices rise on copper and there's a fair amount of work. Some of the stuff we've just been awarded is in that commodity. What we're seeing is capacity replacement programs in iron ore. They've shipped as much as they can ship and now they got to figure out how to refill the ability to perform. We're also seeing some opportunities in bauxite still in Western Africa. And then, we're starting to see some aluminum projects come back on the fabrication side. So it's mostly aluminum, copper and iron ore that we're seeing move.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And then, can you talk about the opportunities you're pursing in Government and Diversified Services there? How are you thinking about the opportunities to grow backlog over the next 12 months? anything meaningful on the radar that we need to keep in mind?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I think the \u2013 Bruce is in as good a position to answer this question as I am having come from that. But I think when you think about government work, there's no new work. You got to take it away from someone. And there's a fair amount of bids that are coming up in the next, say, three to four quarters. But I think the biggest thing that's going to be in the near-term is just how much do we need to do to help Puerto Rico.","If you look at, what, 2005, 2006, after Katrina, I would argue that Puerto Rico's damage rivals Katrina. And I think this first contract will grow. I mean it's out in the contracting space. There's an additional $600 million available. That's just the way they're using the process. So there's going to be growth there. And I think that you see the strife around the globe. And I think our LOGCAP contracts certainly won't be shrinking over the near-term, and there's probably some additional opportunities there.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you. And lastly, David, earlier you mentioned you see pretty good opportunities in oil and gas within the I think six to 12-month timeframe. Can you just flesh out what part of the oil and gas food chain you see moving forward first? I guess what are the most positive end markets within that area?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Petrochemicals and refining, I'd say that's one and two. There will be one or two LNG projects that go very little upstream offshore, although we're starting to see some studies around new production, which I think is probably 2019 kind of a timeframe, 2019, 2020 before it starts to come back. But there are significant opportunities in petrochemicals and refining.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And Thank you. And next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","Good evening, everybody.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Mike, I can't hear you.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","Can you hear me now? Can you hear me now?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","Okay. Thanks. Sorry, David. Two thoughts. First, good news about the Purple Line getting going. So that could be very helpful for the next couple years on the infrastructure side. Can you refresh us on your strategy still of those $200 million to $300 million, $400 million projects and that you're pursuing, how we might see some of that flush through? And are there any big larger type projects given that you're seeing a lot more state and local funding coming through the door that Fluor could be helpful on that front or even some P3 things down the road?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I think in the near-term what you're going to see is, is the $200 million to $400 million project. There's, I don't know, a half a dozen or so that we think we'll be successful on as we go into 2018. There's a big bid slate that we're working on, on various projects and in various in infrastructure kinds of markets that probably won't be awarded until 2019. So we kind of went through a low. We had a couple of big ones with like Purple Line into backlog, we've been successful on the smaller projects. And then, it's going to be a little bit of a low before those big projects come back. But we're working on the procurement on and bid development on several large ones.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","I hope we can find another bridge to use the Left Coast Lifter?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","That's right. That's right.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","And I drive over that bridge twice a day, so they're all doing and working real hard and doing a great job there.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","That's good.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","So one commuter appreciates it.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","You'd be surprised how many commuters I get e-mails from.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","Good or bad?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","They'll only let me see the good ones.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","So second question is, I know it just got announced this morning, but with the U.S. tax reform, I don't know if there's any early indication on how that might impact things looking into 2018 if things goes from the corporate side. But do you get a sense from the people you talked to in the commissions that you're on such that there could be a lot more activity in the U.S. economically going forward. And can Fluor generate benefits from some of that if we continue to see this momentum we're seeing in the U.S. economy?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, if we can get everybody to make it law, that'd be great. We still got that process to go through and I'm sure there'll be some reconciliations that takes place. But from a vantage point on the National Association of Manufacturers, we're already seeing significant reinvestment in the United States in manufacturing. And we're well-positioned in that market in a lot of the things we're doing. There's a fair amount of direct investment in the United States from outside as well.","So I think it's going to have a positive impact once it becomes law. And the simplicity of what they've put forth, I think, is really good for everybody. So I think there will be a good uptick in terms of investment and kind of regenerating that manufacturing, Mike, of the U.S. I'm pretty excited about that and for a lot of the reasons, not withstanding that we'll hopefully build our fair share of that. So I'm pretty optimistic that the new tax law will be a good catalyst for growth.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners","Excellent, David. Thank you very much.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks.","Operator","And thank you. And lastly from Baird, we have Justin Hauke.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Thanks. So I've got kind of two quick ones here. First, I just wanted to clarify maybe the contribution from the nukes and try to understand if there's any nuke residual revenue in the fourth quarter, or if we should think that the $0.57 to $0.67 that's implied there is basically a clean number versus maybe some contribution you had in the second quarter and the third quarter?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, we're still working on both sides. So, I mean, it's little onesies and twosie kind of thing. I think we still got about 140 people on the SCANA site helping them shut that project down. So there'll be some, but it won't be material.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Great. And then, I guess the second question is just more capital allocation. It's been I guess about two years since you've done any buybacks. It sounds like you're saying that you feel pretty good that you're at a bottom here. Previously, you were buying the stock in the mid-40s, balance sheet's in a good position, you mostly \u2013 I guess you don't really have much on the fab yard left to invest in. Is buyback back on the table or what are you thinking about what you want to do with the balance sheet here?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I'll let Bruce answer that.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Justin, that's a good question. Obviously, our cash and securities balance remains at over $2 billion, and that's very consistent with where we've been. But relative to our capital strategy, it really remains unchanged. So, as you know, we have a priority for our capital allocations. The first, of course, is to fund current operations. The second is to service our shareholders by paying our dividends. Third, looking at very select niche M&A opportunities. And lastly, share repurchase when we have excess cash and capital that we think \u2013 I don't think we're in that position where we have worked our way down that list effectively right now. So for the near-term, we don't see share repurchases is the best place to put our capital right now.","Justin P. Hauke - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And, gentlemen, we have no further questions in the queue. I'll turn the call back over to you for finally remarks.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, this is a record in terms of time and we really appreciate that actually. I wondered is it because of people breaking the rules and asking three and six questions that got us here. I was really disappointed that Michael didn't say anything about my cowboys, but we'll save that for later. But I would like to thank everyone for participating in the call. I believe that our results this quarter are stepped in the right direction. And it's clear that we're focusing on execution and positioning ourselves to win advantaged projects across all of the end markets that we serve. We greatly appreciate your support, and thank you for your time today.","Operator","And that concludes today's conference call, and we thank you for joining."],"9551":["Fluor Corporation (NYSE:FLR) Q4 2019 Earnings Conference Call February 18, 2020  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Jason Landkamer - Director, Investor Relations","Alan Boeckmann - Executive Chairman","Carlos Hernandez - Chief Executive Officer","Mike Steuert - Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Steven Fisher - UBS","Jamie Cook - Credit Suisse","Andy Lee - Citi","Andrew Wittmann - Baird","Michael Dudas - Vertical Research","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank","Sean Eastman - KeyBanc Capital Markets","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Fluor Corporation's Fourth Quarter 2019 Year-End Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. A question-and-answer session will follow management's presentation. A replay of today's conference call will be available at approximately 10:30 AM Eastern Time today accessible on Fluor's website at investor.fluor.com. The web replay will be available for 30 days. A telephone replay will also be available through 7:30 AM Eastern Time on February 25 through a registration link also accessible on Fluor's website at investor.fluor.com.","At this time for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Jason Landkamer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Landkamer.","Jason Landkamer","Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Fluor's fourth quarter 2019 conference call. With us today are Alan Boeckmann, Fluor's Executive Chairman; Carlos Hernandez, Fluor's Chief Executive Officer; and Mike Steuert, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our fourth quarter announcement was released earlier this morning. We have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our safe harbor note regarding forward-looking statements which is summarized on slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's filings with the SEC.","Given the company has not finalized and filed its full year financial results, the information provided today is preliminary and unaudited and could be affected by subsequent events or determinations. During this call, we may discuss certain forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts to the comparable GAAP measures are not practicable given the nature of the potential adjustments. For additional information see our release from this morning.","I'll now turn the call over to Alan Boeckmann, Fluor's Executive Chairman. Alan?","Alan Boeckmann","Thank you, Jason, and good morning to all of you. There are several important business updates we'd like to share with you this morning. I'll start by addressing the investigation that we reported in today's press release.","As reported, the SEC is conducting an investigation of the company's past accounting and financial reporting and has requested documents and information related to projects for which the company recorded charges in the second quarter of 2019. In the course of responding to the SEC's data requests and conducting our own internal review, the company is looking at its prior revenue recognition, charges and related control environment, focusing initially on the Radford contract.","While we currently believe that the total dollar amount of the revenue and subsequent charges taken on this project was correct, we are reviewing whether the accounting and financial reporting along with a limited number of additional projects was recognized in the appropriate reporting period.","Let me make a statement that we do not believe at this time that we have material errors that is the intent of the investigation. To accomplish this, a special committee of the Board of Directors has been formed and will complete a review with the assistance of external advisers. We have informed the SEC of our actions.","Given the ongoing internal review and the recent developments of two projects, we will not be able to complete and file our Form 10-K prior to the end of February. In addition, this means that any financial information we provide today is preliminary, unaudited and subject to change.","While it is disappointing to delay the filing of our audited financial statements, we are confident that the company and our Board are on the right path to complete their review in a transparent and comprehensive manner. Looking forward, I believe our tireless efforts to put this company solidly on the path to profitability, our strategic review led meaningful changes at Fluor, including significant organizational and management changes, Board refreshment and the establishment of a Risk Committee at the Board level. We will continue to selectively pursue lump-sum work and we now feel better positioned in bidding with our revised pursuit criteria and more disciplined in execution with our enhanced Board and management oversight.","I'd like to take a moment to reinforce my conviction in Fluor's plan for long-term success. We expect to work off the majority of our problem projects this year and have a backlog that consists mainly of projects bid under the proper conditions. Our cash position is strong, our commitment to risk management is unwavering and we will remain vigilant and disciplined in our pursuit of projects. We firmly believe that Fluor will emerge from 2020 in a position of strength poised to succeed for the next decade and beyond.","And with that Carlos will now talk about our end markets and what we expect to accomplish in 2020 to deliver value for our shareholders and customers. Carlos?","Carlos Hernandez","Thanks, Alan and good morning, everyone. There are three main topics I'd like to cover today. But before I begin, I want to briefly address the coronavirus. While we recognize the impact of the virus is widespread our health, safety and environmental group has taken the lead in putting procedures in place to protect our employees and their families.","To-date none of our employees or their families have contracted the virus. Our major offices in China are now open and we expect to ramp-up to normal staffing levels over the next several weeks. ","Our fabrication yard is also open and most of the local staff and craft are returning to work. Workers from other provinces will be subject to a 14-day quarantine period before they commence work. We're currently assessing the impact that coronavirus has on our projects and have already made or submitted force majeure notices where appropriate.","Now the three main topics I'd like to discuss today are: one, an update on the AMECO and government businesses; two, our new risk profile and criteria; and three, a high-level review of our segments and prospects.","If you would please turn to slide 3. Last fall as part of Fluor's strategic review to improve its financial position, the company announced that it was initiating plans to sell substantially all of the government business.","As we look through Q4 and realized some of the early benefits of the restructuring plan, we gained confidence in our solid liquidity position and our viable options for generating cash flow such that we no longer deem it necessary or advisable to proceed with the sale of this important and attractive asset. As a result, we have decided to retain this business which will cease to be reported as a discontinued operation in the first quarter of 2020.","On the AMECO front this transaction continues to progress and our plan to sell this business remains unchanged. It is our intent to have made significant progress with one or more potential buyers by the end of the second quarter.","Now turning to our risk profile. As Alan mentioned risk imbalance has proven to be a challenge for our industry. As a result, we continue to take significant actions to enhance our risk profile and implement stronger controls. These risk-mitigating actions include a realignment of our engineering, procurement and budget management disciplines, which now report directly into the business units providing improved oversight.","As an example of our new discipline around project pursuit, we recently participated in a bid proposal where the client wanted to proceed with unreasonable schedule and cost risks assigned to the contractor. Through negotiations and alignment with the client we were able to conform the contract to meet our revised pursuit criteria and we outlined -- that we outlined last year. The results benefited both the client and Fluor.","Now please turn to slide 5 for an update on our segments. In Energy & Chemicals we booked new awards of $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter and ending backlog is expected to be $14.1 billion. New awards include EPC phase for a manufacturing facility for a chemical used by -- to make nylon polymers, fibers and other specialty materials for INVISTA in China.","We also booked the Polyols Petrochemicals project in India for Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited. The contract includes the detailed design, engineering, procurement and construction management services intended to help reduce India's dependence on petrochemical imports.","We recently won the EPFC for Canada, Kuwait Petroleum Corporation's PDH Silo project which we -- were booked in the first quarter of 2020. This bid was under our current guidelines and we have built three PDH plants with the same technology.","Our LNG Canada project in Kitimat is well underway. We started piling activities in the fourth quarter, which will continue into next year. Both fabrication yards recently celebrated the first steel cut for the OSBL and ISBL portions of the project. We continue to monitor our progress and are focused on achieving our next major milestones completing the 90% model reviews.","Moving to our offshore project. This project is staying relatively close to its revised forecast. New awards for 2020 will be led by the Mozambique Rovuma LNG project. We expect to book this project this year and are currently executing this project under a limited notice to proceed.","Fluor along with our partners JGC and Technip have assembled a strong team that is designed to execute this project on schedule and on budget. Last quarter we talked about the Formosa Sunshine project in Louisiana and remain optimistic about this project moving forward. We now expect to see the various EPC packages of this project awarded in the second half of 2020 and into 2021. We also see a number of refinery and petrochemical projects in Europe, North America and Asia Pacific.","Now turning to Mining & Industrial on Slide 6. We expect to end the year with a backlog of $5.4 billion and fourth quarter new awards were about $0.5 billion. Fourth quarter awards were driven by EPC contracts for data centers in our Advanced Manufacturing and Technologies group.","Mining awards have been light in 2019 as anticipated, but we expect to see the FEED work we have been completing convert into EPC awards in the back half of 2020. Our prospects continue to be led by copper, bauxite and lithium opportunities. Our market position remains very strong. We have great relationships with the industry leaders and are working with them to successfully execute complex projects around the world.","For Infrastructure & Power, backlog at the end of the fourth quarter was $6.9 billion. New awards in the fourth quarter were modest. While we expect to have a lower level of new awards for infrastructure in 2020, we continue to see interest at the state level on improving infrastructure. We're confident that we are focusing on the right states, where we have the right track record to win the right projects.","Now please turn to Slide 7. In Government, we ended the year with an expected backlog of $3.8 billion. Last quarter we were \u2013 and our joint venture partners were selected to lead the Central Plateau Cleanup Contract at the Department of Energy's Hanford site near Richland, Washington.","Fluor was previously at this site from 1996 to 2009. We were also pursuing the Hanford Tank Closure Contract and we expect to hear a decision towards the end of February. In Diversified Services, we expect to end the year with a backlog of $2.5 billion. Our historic restructuring is almost complete and well positioned for 2020.","Now turning to Slide 8. The other segment includes our two fixed government projects, Radford and Warren and our investment in NuScale. Both of the Radford and Warren projects are continuing to progress and we do not expect to take any additional forecast additions in the fourth quarter.","As for NuScale, it cleared a major milestone in December, when the NRC concluded the Phase IV review of its design application with no open items. NuScale remains on track to receive its final design approval in September of this year.","Funding in the second half of 2019 was provided by third-party investors. We're actively engaged in discussions with additional potential investors. Also earlier this month, the Department of Energy approved up to $350 million in cost saving financial systems.","And now I'll turn the call over to Mike to provide a few highlights for 2019 and our outlook for 2020. Mike?","Mike Steuert","Thank you, Carlos. Please turn to Slide 9. While we are unable to announce our final financial results, we can provide key preliminary unaudited highlights for 2019. Cash flow in the fourth quarter is expected to be strong, benefiting from a $150 million closeout of a completed project. Fluor's cash, plus marketable securities at year-end was $2 billion, up slightly from a year ago. Our available domestic cash balance at year-end represents 40% of total cash.","Corporate G&A expense for 2019 is expected to be $167 million, up from $118 million a year ago, primarily driven by foreign exchange losses as compared to gains a year ago. For the full year 2019, we paid $118 million in dividends and given our announced dividend reduction payments for 2020, would be approximately $56 million. Primary cost impacting our performance in 2020, are expected to be the following. Restructuring and other exit costs of $202 million, $84 million of which is noncash; noncash write-off of our deferred tax assets of $668 million; noncash impairment charges of $305 million; and a noncash expense of $138 million associated with the settlement of the U.K. pension plan.","Before I discuss our 2020 outlook, I want to provide an update on a few of the financial initiatives, we addressed on our strategic review call in September. Please turn to slide 10. For our P3 monetization initiative, we have seen significant interest in our assets including those in Europe. We have also received indications of interest for our American assets. We are continuing to make progress on reducing overhead expenses across the organization.","In the past few months, we have started to reduce our real estate footprint and related overhead expense. We expect to achieve the previously disclosed run rate of $100 million in annual savings by the fourth quarter of this year. We are in the process of examining other transactions that will along with the sale of AMECO continue to allow us to strengthen our balance sheet and our financial position through debt reduction and enhancing our cash position. Our goal remains to generate substantial cash from asset sales and other receivable collections, sufficient to maintain our investment-grade rating.","I will conclude by commenting on our guidance for 2020, which is on slide 11. We are establishing a 2020 adjusted earnings per share guidance range of $1.40 to $1.60 per share from continuing operations. We are excluding any restructuring expense or other special nonrecurring items from our guidance. We are also excluding NuScale expenses from our guidance, as we expect additional funding will be provided by third-party investors. Our guidance also excludes any earnings from our AMECO business, which we expect to divest this year and we are reporting as discontinued operations.","Our assumptions for 2020 include modest revenue growth over 2019; adjusted G&A expense of approximately $40 million to $50 million per quarter; a tax rate of approximately 28%; and approximately $60 million in restructuring costs. Reflecting on revised pursuit criteria, we expect a minor improvement in new awards in 2020, with year-end 2020 backlog modestly down compared to 2019.","I also want to comment on cash flow in 2020. In the fourth quarter, we utilized approximately $100 million of cash to fund our previously announced Challenge Projects below what we anticipated. We have approximately $500 million of cash requirements remaining related to our loss projects, two-thirds of which we expect to fund in 2020. A portion of this funding has already occurred so far in the first quarter.","Moving to slide 12. We anticipate full year margins in the Energy & Chemicals group of approximately 3% to 5%, improving as the year progresses. Mining & Industrial margins of approximately 2% to 3%; Infrastructure & Power margins of approximately 1%; and Government margins of approximately 2.5% to 3.5%; and finally, Diversified Services margins of 3% to 4%.","Before we turn it over to G&A -- or Q&A, excuse me, we want to note that there's no additional information that we can share regarding the delay in our financial filings beyond what we provided today in our remarks and in our press release. While the SEC investigation may not be concluded in the near term, we anticipate filing our Form 10-K when our reviews are complete.","With that, operator, we are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We'll now take our first question from Steven Fisher from UBS. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Steven Fisher","Great. Thanks. Good morning. I did have some further questions on the SEC investigation, but I guess I'll have to hold off on those. So maybe starting with, I guess, to what extent are you seeing your revenues being delayed relative to what you would have thought a few months ago? Because it seems like the government business could be contributing something like $0.35 to $0.40 of earnings in 2020, which is now a meaningful part of the 2020 guidance which would have been there before.","And the margin for the E&C segment isn't too far off, but I think expectations were. So are the revenues in E&C now much lower than what we would have been thinking about a few months ago? I think you said they were going to be up a little bit, but maybe just talk a little bit of what you're seeing on the revenue front and how projects are proceeding.","Carlos Hernandez","Yes, Steve, let me -- thanks for that question. What happened, as you can tell from the new awards in 2019 is, there have been several projects that have been canceled, couple of methanol projects that have been canceled, a couple of projects that had moved into 2020, Rovuma being one of them. So that's, I think, probably the reason why the revenue is not as high. We do still expect a little bit modest growth in revenue for 2020, but the -- there has been a movement to the right-hand number of projects.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then, in the release you talked about some recent developments on two projects. Can you just talk a little bit more? If I didn't miss it in what your prepared remarks were, what are those projects? What are the recent developments that you're talking about there?","And then, maybe the bigger picture is that, I mean, clearly you're making progress on the turnaround, but the quarterly results still have some big negative surprises here. So I guess to what extent now going forward do you have some more visibility to -- in terms of your arms around what's going on and cleaner in quarters? Thank you.","Mike Steuert","Yes, let me answer that question in a few different parts. Because of the investigations, we're not able to file the Form 10-K. And as a result our -- which remain open for subsequent events on various projects. And that's why we use of the word -- use the word expect in a lot of the financials and can't be a little bit more precise here as the year turns out.","And that's, in large part, driven because of a percent complete accounting that requires us to adjust our estimates for subsequent events that occur prior to our filing date. That impacts all projects. There are a couple that we just indicated that perhaps a little more sensitive to those changes than others. And that's why we made that comment that that really impacts all of the projects for the year.","Certainly, we had some unusual costs in the fourth quarter that were non-recurring, the U.K. pension adjustment, which was a good thing for Fluor. That allowed us over the past year to really essentially cap and reduce our liabilities on future pension expenses. We've had some restructuring costs.","And as I indicated, we expect those -- some of those restructuring costs to continue into 2020. We do expect the performance of the company to improve as we move through 2020. I made that comment in terms of E&C and we think we'll see that in other sectors as well -- or segments as well as we move through the year. So it's operational. We are seeing improved performance that's going to be gradual throughout 2020.","Steven Fisher","Okay. That's helpful. But just, again, if I could. I know there's some sensitivity here, the developments on the two projects. Is these projects that are deteriorating in their performance, or is this something different?","Mike Steuert","No, it's not a performance deterioration issue per se. It's that we've left those projects as all of the projects open for subsequent adjustments. We'll have to see how that transpires as we move through the first quarter before we file our Form 10-K.","Steven Fisher","Okay. I'll turn it over. Thanks.","Operator","And now we'll take our next question from Jamie Cook from Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jamie Cook","Hi. Good morning. I guess my first question, Mike, is on the cash flow side. Understanding, you said the $500 million of cash flow drag of which two-third is in 2020. But what's your expectation in terms of cash generation if any for the year, and how we think about first half versus second half?","And then, I guess my second question is I guess on the asset sales. Do we know -- do we have an updated proceeds number given we're just selling AMECO now? And then it sounds like there's other assets that could potentially be up for sale. I'm just trying to understand how big, how material that is, and what are the decisions driving other potential asset sales, if I'm reading it right. Is it to reduce cyclicality? Is it we still want to get to the $1 billion in proceeds? I'm just trying to understand the thought process there given Government is now off the table. Thank you.","Mike Steuert","Okay. Let me address cash flow. Seasonally, our first quarter cash flow is somewhat negative. It strengthens as we move through the year. But as you've seen in the past, our cash flow can be very -- can be substantially variable. It's up and down, quite a bit as you move through the year and even as you move from month-to-month, depending on advances on projects and then how we burn through the advances that we receive as well.","But we do expect our capital to strengthen as we move through 2020. And we do expect our cash flow generation from operations to fund a substantial portion of the cash that we were going to need to fund the loss projects that we've talked about in the second quarter of 2019. So, we expect to see our right now for our plan our cash flow generation should fund the major part of the losses on those projects in 2020.","Jamie Cook","Okay.","Alan Boeckmann","Let me just add one more comment to that. I think Mike is exactly right. But -- and you look at the comment as Carlos said to keep the Government group, I'm really pleased with the swift implementation of this team on all the actions that came out of our strategic and operational review. So that -- and maintaining our investment-grade credit rating, if you'll recall, is a primary objective. And we believe now that we have strengthened our financial position, and we see additional means to generate cash to make this possible. I'm extremely pleased with where we're at in this regard.","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. Let me just add something to that, because we've always known the Government business is a very valuable business. It's got viable earnings and cash flow and substantially reimbursable. And for that reason, we had very strong interest from many well-funded buyers both strategic and financial [plan] [ph].","Most of the buyers has approached us when we announced that we were going to divest the business. But as Alan stated, we're so pleased that we're going to be able to keep this significant contributor for -- of earnings and cash flow, and the reasons that we're able to keep Government is a credit to our organization.","Our efforts and our people have been very focused on cash conservation and generation. As a result, as of the end of 2019, we had $2.0 billion in the bank, which is more than we had anticipated. We have been successful in monetizing a number of claims and expect to do more of the same this year and next year.","We're encouraged by the interest in our P3 investment and our excess real estate. And we've reduced the annual dividend by more than half. The cost savings -- or the cost reductions efforts will be resulting in cash savings. And of course, we're proceeding with the AMECO sale, which will raise significant cash and relieve us of the associated capital expenditures of that business.","So the combination of these factors really drove our decision to keep Government. And as Mike stated, we're going to maintain a strong balance sheet to support our objective of maintaining an investment-grade rating, and obviously keep the benefits of the Government and its very talented people.","Jamie Cook","But do we have an updated how to think about it range for the AMECO business if you're willing to provide one, just because you provided a range before when Government and AMECO were together?","And then, the other assets that you're contemplating is it just real estate and the P3 investments? As I'm thinking about Fluor's what will remain strategic to Fluor's portfolio?","Mike Steuert","Jamie, we haven't -- we're not going to give ranges on individual transactions on this, but we do think that the combination of sale of AMECO, the sale of real estate, sell some of our P3 investments, will give us the amount of cash necessary to maintain our investment-grade rating to modestly reduce our debt and enhance our domestic cash position.","Jamie Cook","Okay. Thanks. I\u2019ll get back in queue.","Operator","And now we'll take our next question from Andrew Kaplowitz from Citi. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andy Lee","Hey, guys. It's Andy Lee on for Andy Kaplowitz. Thanks for taking my question. So just the first question in terms of your 2020 outlook for margins for the different segments comparing that to our 2019 Q4 guidance the margins seemed a little bit lower in our E&C Infrastructure & Power and Diversified Services. So can you just talk a little bit about the difference there? I mean, is it just seasonality, or is it the lower-than-expected revenue like versus a few months ago, or is there anything else that's driving that?","Carlos Hernandez","So let me start with that \u2013 answer part of that Andy and maybe I'll ask Mike to follow-up. Look, we have \u2013 we've said in the past that 2020 is going to be a transition year for us. And we are still working off some of the problem projects. And so when we gave guidance, we're trying to regain our credibility in the marketplace. So we are giving a guidance that we believe we're going to make it understanding that, there's a lot of unknown still in 2020. But we are going to be seeing progress through the year as we go. Mike, do you want to add something?","Mike Steuert","We often have commented with the charges we took last year on the infrastructure projects that we will have a number of lower zero margin projects and that's impacting the outlook for margins in infrastructure through this year.","Andy Lee","Okay. Got it. And then secondly on the \u2013 on NuScale. I think you guys mentioned now you just hope to find new investors for \u2013 to fund the NuScale. But how likely is it to find the necessary investors versus funding ourselves ultimately?","Alan Boeckmann","This is Alan. Let me respond to that. We are in discussions with potential investors right now that give us significant confidence in our statement that the third-party investors will be \u2013 will provide the funding to cover the overhead cost of NuScale. Carlos mentioned the coming through the NRC approval of gate 4. That is probably the most critical gate in that entire process. The rest is fairly rote process to get through it into September. We actually think that this maybe improved. It's that milestone plus the opportunity for several projects that is starting to attract investors. And we're seeing a significant response. So yeah, we \u2013 it's a very good question. I'm glad you asked it. We do believe that this entity is well on its way to commercial realization.","Andy Lee","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Operator","We'll now take our next question from Andrew Wittmann from Baird. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Andrew Wittmann","Excuse me. Sorry, guys. Mike I just wanted to clarify on the restructuring charges here. Looks like you've got $118 million of cash that are planned to go into restructuring actions. I just want to understand a little bit more about what that is. And is that extra $118 million needed to accomplish the $100 million run rate savings that you previously talked about and talked about on the call today, or should we expect that that extra cash that you're putting into restructuring delivers incremental savings \u2013 cost savings for the bottom line?","Mike Steuert","So some of the restructuring costs are to reduce our real estate footprint and generate savings going forward. Some other restructuring costs are to reduce headcount and also reduce savings. They'll contribute to the $100 million run rate improvement in overhead. And as we mentioned before, the majority of that overhead savings is going to occur in the business units as opposed to corporate. And even the ones that result in corporate will be in part reflected in lower allocations to the business units. So you won't see it all \u2013 you won't even see that much of it in the corporate numbers going forward, but rather in the business margins. It's a wide range of things. Some of it is cash and non-cash and it's a wide range of actions just taken to improve our cost structure across the company.","Andrew Wittmann","So \u2013 okay. But is \u2013 do you expecting that you'll be able to exceed the previous targets that you outlined though on your cost synergies?","Mike Steuert","Yes, we do. We said we expected to see our $100 million in cost savings in the business by the fourth quarter of this year.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay.","Mike Steuert","I guess, a lot of that will be in the business units \u2013 in the business unit margins as opposed to in the corporate G&A expense.","Andrew Wittmann","Great. Of course. Okay. And then I guess my second question was just on the awards. So, I guess, in the quarter it seemed like one of the large awards and I don't know this but maybe if you could comment on the Chinese EPC job here for the petchem job for nylon as the product here. That seems like one of the large awards in the quarter if not the largest award.","And I just wanted to understand is that one of the fixed price lump-sum job? And how are you going to manage the risk? I know that you've been in China. And obviously, the fabrication yard you're in China. I can't recall seeing an EPC job of particularly the size for a while and just wanted to get a sense of how you're going to execute that on the risk terms on that job in particular?","Carlos Hernandez","Yes. And thanks for that question. That project as all our projects now meets our criteria. And one of the ways that we can get comfortable with lump-sum projects is for us to do a reimbursable FEED and development phase. And then at some point we're comfortable that we have defined the scope adequately and have adequate information with respect to the procurement and the vendor information converted to a lump-sum and that's exactly what's happened with this one. We have been executing that project on a reimbursable basis and at some point, we will convert it to lump-sum.","Andrew Wittmann","Got it. And then just kind of a clerical question here. The $150 million closeout is a very nice closeout. I was wondering Mike if you could just give us a little bit more detail on that. What job was that?","Mike Steuert","We are not disclosing that.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And now we'll take our next question from Michael Dudas from Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Michael Dudas","Good morning gentlemen. I guess for Carlos looking at -- you indicated in your prepared remarks or maybe announced some delays in certainly projects moving to the right. Maybe you could add a little bit more insight relative to given what's happening in the oil markets given the virus indications what you're hearing on the ground with the clients how does your pipeline look looking towards 2020 aside from the projects that you called out in your prepared remarks that you anticipate happen later this year relative to get to that ramp for a slight decline in backlog and give you some confidence for a reasonable transition in 2021?","Carlos Hernandez","Well, our pipeline in E&C we pretty much identified some of that pipeline. It looks very solid at this point. I think what we have we're going to see in mining is more EPC work picking up in mining as the FEEDs that we've been working on develop into full EPC work.","So, I can't say that our pipeline is going to result in new awards that exceed 2019 by a lot, but we're definitely going to exceed 2019 -- I'm sorry 2019 but we're definitely going to exceed 2019 new awards.","Michael Dudas","But on the energy side, is there a sense though of like kind of caution relative going into 2020 given with oil price and buyers that you're sensing from your clients? And is there a visibility that could maybe inflect a bit as we move into the second half of the year?","Carlos Hernandez","Well, as we talk to clients they are obviously concerned about the coronavirus. But I don't -- they don't see that as a long-term impediment going forward with their capital expenditure plans. So, obviously, our clients are much more disciplined now than they have been in the past about that. But I don't expect that the plans are going to be contracted any more than what they had previously announced.","Michael Dudas","Terrific. And then my follow-up I mean on the Government side now that it's back into fold into Fluor's business model, maybe a little bit more view on what you have, what re-competes or what the booking opportunities. I know you got the Plateau Contract is very supportive that you see through Government and how that can play out for even improved cash flow as some of these revenues click in and the risk this model changes as we move into later 2020 and 2021?","Carlos Hernandez","Well, as you know we have a very, very strong position in the DOE space with a number of labs that we're managing. We have -- this is not a predictable side of the business but we are strong with FEMA as well. And the LOGCAP business is going to be changing. But I think we're well-positioned in those areas for additional awards from the government. And obviously, our -- the prospective buyers of that business have to as well as we have a lot of, lot of interest in that business.","Michael Dudas","Lot of this pointed the bright sight. Appreciate, Carlos. Thank you.","Carlos Hernandez","Yeah. Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Thank you. And now, we'll take our next question from Jerry Revich from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Jerry Revich","Yes, hi, good morning everyone.","Carlos Hernandez","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","So out of the $500 million of expected cash outflows to complete legacy projects, can you just give us a sense for how many projects we're talking about? And does that include Radford and Warren as well? Just additional context around the scope of what that $500 million addressable would be helpful?","Mike Steuert","Yes. It really includes the 15 projects in the second quarter that we took charges on. Now all of those don't represent cash flow. There's a handful of those that are settlements that actually generated cash. And some of them are just accounting adjustments that were non-cash. But of the ones that do have cash requirements going forward that's what the $500 million represents. And again, we expect about two-thirds of that to occur this year and then some of the funding in subsequent 2021. And yes, it does include Radford and Warren.","Jerry Revich","And sorry, did you say it does include Radford and Warren? And how many projects in total? Does that include appreciating the fact that a bunch of the projects identified on Q2 had non-cash charges?","Mike Steuert","Right. It does include Radford and Warren, yes, it does. I don't have the exact number at hand, but I would say perhaps 8 to 10 of the 16 will represent material cash outflows.","Jerry Revich","Okay. And lastly, what will your percentage of completion be on those 8 to 10 projects exiting 2020 if you hit the current schedules?","Mike Steuert","We expect to complete a lot of those by the end of 2020. A few will roll over into 2021 some of the more recent ones such as Warren that we just started in 2019. But the majority will be complete as we end 2020. That's why we're saying most of the funding will occur in 2020.","Jerry Revich","And sorry, let me add just one more please. Considering the time range on these projects continuing into 2021, can you just folks talk about what gave you the confidence to retain the Government services business considering it looks like there's substantial wood to chop still on a number of these projects exiting 2020?","Carlos Hernandez","Well Jerry as we mentioned, we have a number of ways to generate cash. The largest one is AMECO which will be -- we expect to sell maybe in Q3 having a buyer by -- by the end of Q2. And we're going to have savings in CapEx. We're going to have P3 that we're going to be selling and monetization of a number of claims. For example, the one that we just recorded in the fourth quarter is one of those. So we have increasing confidence that we're going to be able to generate the cash that we need to cover the $500 million and then some of the project charges.","Jerry Revich","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","And now we'll take our next question from Chad Dillard from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Chad Dillard","Hi, good morning, guys.","Carlos Hernandez","Good morning.","Mike Steuert","Good morning.","Chad Dillard","So I just want to make sure I had my arms around the cash conversions for 2020. So I was hoping you could provide a bridge from net income to cash flow realizing you guys talked about I guess it's about $335 million of projects into the cash burn, but just wanted to also understand cash post from restructuring working capital swings closeouts CapEx. And ultimately, what sort of leverage target are you expecting to achieve in 2020?","Mike Steuert","Given where we are, we're not finalizing our statements for 2019. And having the beginning balance, it's really hard to go through a very detailed cash flow reconciliation for you from earnings all the way down to cash. It's very complex for Fluor because every single project is different and has a different cash profile. That's why we give our earnings guidance. This is really the first time we're giving cash flow guidance. It's something that we manage very aggressively and we manage it on a project-by-project basis. And for most of our projects our intent is to be cash positive.","Now, obviously, when we have a project that's in a loss position like we announced in the second quarter those projects remain in a cash positive position but we aggressively pursue that. It's also very complicated by the fact that one of our projects is on a JV basis. We have partners and that impacts the cash that we pull out the projects that are not complete in over time. And that really complicates it.","So as we go through this year, we'll provide additional insight on cash flow. But right now, we're just giving high level guidance in terms of our expectation that cash flow from continuing operations including both from retaining our government business will fund most of the project losses. And we expect to return the required fund in 2020.","Chad Dillard","Got it. And then just a question on the E&C margin guidance. It's certainly little bit wider than what it's been historically. So I was hoping you could just talk about just what each of the bookends represent and how to think about that?","Mike Steuert","All right. The E&C margins, again this reflects how some of these projects go throughout the year. Obviously in the first part of the year, we were looking for lower margins as some of our other projects kick in that were awarded in 2019 and as we progress some of the other projects such as LNG throughout the year. So it's really the -- margin development in 2020 is very highly impacted by how these specific projects progress throughout the year. And that's why it impacts our quarter-to-quarter strengths. That's what impacts the fact that we expect improving margins as we move throughout the year.","Chad Dillard","Thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Feniger from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open. Mr. Feniger, please un-mute your line. I'm afraid Mr. Feniger stepped away.","Our next question is from Sean Eastman from KeyBanc Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Your line is open.","Sean Eastman","Hi, gentlemen. Thanks for taking my question. Just going back on the cash flow, your comments around operating cash being able to fund a substantial portion of what's needed to fund the loss projects. It would be helpful to get a little bit of context if possible just around how much claims are driving that dynamic. And just what gives you confidence around the line of sight around those claims given those are things that seem to be tricky to pin down in a particular year in terms of getting the cash in the door?","Mike Steuert","Sure. I mean, your observation is correct that it's tricky or difficult to forecast claim revenue. It's complex. You'd have to rely on lawyers to get your money. There's a lot of difficulties involved. But looking at our cash flow for 2020 is not based on any significant claim revenue. We don't factor that into how we manage the business going forward because it is so spotty and so difficult to forecast. And some of the claims can take years to resolve.","Sean Eastman","Okay. That's helpful. And then on the targeted domestic readily available cash balance of $1 billion you guys had laid out post the divestitures, we did see that balance tick up fairly meaningfully in 4Q versus 3Q it seems. But I'm just wondering the time line on achieving that $1 billion now with retaining government and whether that's a goal we see achieved at some point here in 2020?","Mike Steuert","So that certainly remains my personal goal and we're working towards that going forward. But as we move through 2020, the asset sales AMECO other potential asset sales and collection of various receivables that are outstanding on our balance sheet will all contribute to that as we move through the year.","Sean Eastman","Okay. And then in terms of the P3 and real estate sales, is there any kind of rough thought on, whether it's a first half versus second half, kind of time line?","Mike Steuert","It's going to be both. And we are --given our financials -- let me put it differently. Given our financial position, we are going to be very, very deliberative, in terms of how we proceed with those sales. And we're going to use effort to maximize value as opposed to try and do something quick. And just get the cash right upfront.","Sean Eastman","Got it, okay, last quick one for me. I've seen several articles written about pause in work at Fab Yards in China, not surprisingly, just curious, whether you foresee any kind of delays or issues around some of the module deliveries to LNG Canada, in light of some of this coronavirus outbreak impacting the Fab Yard there?","Carlos Hernandez","No. Our Yard got back to work on February 10. And at this point, we don't see any delays. But obviously, we'll wait and see when we ramp up completely.","Sean Eastman","Okay, gentlemen. Thanks for the time. I appreciate it.","Carlos Hernandez","Thank you.","Operator","It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Mike Steuert, I'd like to turn the conference back to you, for any additional or closing remarks.","Mike Steuert","Before we conclude, I just want to reiterate, that we are in a period now, where the books are still open. That because of our accounting processes, we are subject to future changes that could impact the financial statements of subsequent events.","And that's why we did mention the two projects, that were there, because they are large projects that perhaps are somewhat more successful to change it, as we go through the completion of our reviews, that we hope to occur as soon as reasonably possible.","And that's why we did mention those two projects. And that it's impossible how to forecast what's going to happen. Everybody just has to be aware that, the books are open, as we go through the remainder of this month and next month.","Carlos Hernandez","Okay. Mike, thank you. And with that, thank you operator. And thanks to all of you for participating on our call today. Last year, we started down the path of making tangible and actionable changes to our business strategy and structure to position for long-term success.","And as we look ahead now, driven by our talented workforce, we will continue to act with a sense of urgency to drive our business forward.

During the quarter, we received a limited notice to proceed on (2:57) LNG Canada project in Kitimat. And we have assembled a remarkable project team and are preparing [Technical Difficulty] (3:04) investment decision, which is expected later this year. We've collaborated with this customer extensively to create a project that will be successful for all parties involved. We started by taking the original FEED package and worked with our partner JGC to design a more economical and appropriate [ph] plot plan (3:23).","We then optimized the design using our zero-based execution approach to define minimum operating requirements and improved capital efficiency. And finally, working [Technical Difficulty] (3:34) with the client we were able to leverage our supply chain, fabrication capabilities allowing us to [Technical Difficulty] (3:42) of needed onsite labor above or 35% which is probably the largest risk on that project.","I look forward to talking more on (3:50) this project once FID is achieved. We also saw (3:56) opportunities on two other LNG projects. We recently [Technical Difficulty] (3:59) our bid for project in the U.S. that could move [Technical Difficulty] (4:04) in 2019. The other prospects in Mozambique currently expected to reach FID in the second half of 2019. Outside of our LNG opportunities, we expect a decision on a large petrochemical plant later this year with another one expected early next year.","Globally we expect that the financial health of our clients will continue to drive CapEx spending on select advantage projects. This includes significant downstream and [Technical Difficulty] (4:36) in Asia and Europe, Africa Middle East.","While we continue to pursue a number of prospects [Technical Difficulty] (4:42) and internationally, we will maintain our [Technical Difficulty] (4:45) and limit our pursuits to projects that allow us to fully leverage our people, systems and processes to maximize opportunity and more importantly minimize risk. The one challenge for the quarter was a project in Europe of which we have $36 million in backlog remaining at the end of the quarter. And at the end of July the project was approximately [Technical Difficulty] (5:08) complete and we expect to reach final completion in September.","Turn to slide 4, the Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power group reported new awards of $3.6 billion in the second quarter including the South Flank iron ore replacement mine for BHP in Australia and the Los Angeles International Airport Automated People Mover project. Ending backlog for the segment was $12.4 billion. I'm pleased to see the mining market continue its upward trajectory [Technical Difficulty] (5:40) as clients turned to us to help improve their capital efficiency.","At the end of the second quarter our backlog stood at $4.8 billion which is a significant improvement from $1.2 billion a year ago. We expect some additional awards over the next two quarters that should drive mining backlog into the $6 billion to $8 billion range by year-end. We continue to see opportunities in infrastructure which includes our recent announcement that our team was the preferred bidder on the Gordie Howe International Bridge project connecting Windsor, Ontario and Detroit, Michigan.","The second project in this region for Fluor and our partner, as we recently completed a Parkway in Windsor that will connect to this bridge. We expect the bridge authority to reach financial close (6:32) on this project this year. Our results (6:36) for this segment include an additional charge related to our gas-fired project in Florida and we have $37 million in backlog remaining on this project at the end of the quarter. And through the end of July the project is 93% complete.","I am pleased to report that last night we were able to successfully achieve first fire on power block 1, which is a huge milestone. And supports the overall individual (7:02) completion dates that we're moving [Technical Difficulty] (7:02). This project along with our Greensville County [ph] project are (7:12) scheduled to be completed by year-end. And this will mark our exit from the fixed-fire power market in the United States. Our power group is currently refocusing its efforts on other end markets.","Turning to slide 5, the Government group reported new awards of $742 million which includes [Technical Difficulty] (7:31) for LOGCAP IV in Afghanistan. Ending [ph] backlog (7:37) was $2.3 billion.","Looking at our opportunities (7:40) for the second half of 2018 we were recently selected by the U.S. Navy's Naval Sea Systems Command and the National Nuclear Security Administration to manage the Naval Nuclear Laboratory. And we are also part of a team that recently won a contract to oversee operations at Los Alamos (7:57) National Laboratory. As we have said in the past, we have wanted to have a bigger role in this space and I'm pleased to see that our strategy (7:59) is coming to fruition. Recent (8:02) wins are in addition to our pursuit of LOGCAP V contract and the liquid waste contracts at Savannah River and Hanford.","Turn to slide 6 please. Diversified Services reported new awards of $513 million which includes an (8:26) award to operate and maintain gas fields in Colombia. Ending backlog for the quarter is $2.2 billion. As you may have heard, our oil and gas clients are beginning to increase spending levels on major maintenance programs, Stork (8:38) is well-positioned to benefit from this increased level of spending.","Before Bruce provides a financial update, I want to briefly comment on tariffs. We've done a lot of homework over the last few months looking at the impact of tariffs on us and our clients. After doing a deep dive on our projects we believe we can mitigate the Fluor exposure to tariffs through purchasing strategies and contract provisions.","Now I'll turn it over to Bruce. Bruce?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, to everyone. If you turn to slide 7, I'll start by discussing new awards and backlog. This quarter we booked new awards of $5.4 billion, driven mainly by $3.6 billion in our Mining, Industrial Infrastructure & Power segment. We were pleased to win several big awards this quarter across the end markets we serve and are encouraged by the growing pipeline of work our clients have entrusted to us. Our book-to- (9:32) bill ratio improved from 0.53 last quarter to 1.1 (9:37).","As David mentioned, we recently won both the Los Alamos National Laboratory contract (9:44) and the Naval Nuclear Laboratory contract in our Government (9:48) Group. I think it's important to note that when we transition on to these sites, we'll see significant margin contributions as we recognize fee (9:56) with no corresponding backlog component.","Please turn to slide 8 (10:03). Revenue for the second quarter improved to $4.9 (10:05] billion, led by increased revenue contributions from the Mining, Infrastructure Industrial & Power segment, as well as the Government segment. Corporate G&A expense for the second quarter was $18 million, compared to $47 million a year ago. Expenses in the quarter (10:21) reflect the benefit of $25 million related to foreign currency exchange (10:21) fluctuations.","Now turn to slide 9. For the quarter, we reported net income attributed to Fluor of $115 million, or $0.81 per diluted share. Results for the quarter do include a $0.56 charge related to estimated cost increases on a downstream project and a power project, $0.21 for the combined positive impact of foreign currency fluctuations at the corporate level as well as for an embedded derivative relating to [Technical Difficulty] (10:59] our joint venture partner in Mexico. And additional non-recurring [Technical Difficulty] (11:04) related to final close out efforts on hurricane related work in Puerto Rico contributed $0.10.","We have provided some highlights from the balance sheet on slide 10. So if you would please turn to slide 10. Fluor's cash plus marketable securities for the quarter was $1.8 billion, flat to last quarter. Quarter-end domestic cash balance was approximately 13% of the total cash and marketable securities. Our domestic cash position reflects the use of cash needed to fund our working capital in Puerto Rico, as Puerto Rico pays its subcontractors before it can invoice the government and return that cash to us and our legacy projects until they are complete.","Before I discuss outlook, I want to cover a few housekeeping items. This evening, we will file an S-3 to renew our (12:00) shelf registration that expired at the end of July. In conjunction with this shelf, we will also file an 8-K that presents our (12:07) 2015, 2016 and 2017 audited results under our new business segment reporting structure. Just to be very clear, this is not a restatement of our financials (12:11). Nothing has changed in our overall results, just the classification.","We also wanted to alert you (12:26) to our progress in closing out our significant (12:28) pension plans around the world. As you might recall, we settled our U.S. pension plan back in 2015. We are now working towards settling our UK pension plan that was frozen in 2011. While our expense for this quarter was small, just $2 million, we do expect to see additional settlement charges in the future. We don't expect this settlement to have a material impact on our cash position. Settling this UK plan will result in lower future expenses and eliminate the actuarial and (12:58) investment risk inherent in defined benefit plans.","Finally, I want point out (13:02) the appendix we've added to the presentation that we posted online (13:07) in this afternoon. In this appendix, you'll find a summary slide updating the status of our gas-fired power project as well as more detail on how we are managing our real estate and G&A expenses.","Now if you'll be so kind, turn to slide 11. I'll conclude my prepared remarks by commenting on our guidance for the (13:27) second half of 2018. We are maintaining 2018 earning guidance in the range from $2.10 (13:36) to $2.50 per diluted share. Guidance assumes G&A expense of approximately $50 million per quarter excluding any impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, (13:47) integration or pension expenses and tax rate of 25% to 30% (13:53).","NuScale expenses are expected to be $75 (13:56) million in 2018 while the run rate for NuScale (14:00) expenses are higher than normal, to-date, we will still limit our investment to (14:05) $75 million this year and invest at a lower rate after this year (14:09).","If you turn to slide 12, we anticipate margins for the remainder of 2018 in the Energy & Chemicals group to be in the 6% to 7% range. Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power excluding NuScale to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% (14:25) range, Government to be approximately (14:30) 3% and Diversified Services to be around 4.5% to 5.5%.","As a final point, we're excited to announce that we're planning to hold an Investor Day in New York on Friday, November 16. We look forward to sharing our progress and goals for 2019 with our investor community.","With that, operator, David and I are ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. One moment. And our first question will come from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good evening. I guess a couple of questions one for David, and one for Bruce. First, Bruce with regards to the guidance, I'm just trying to understand how you're thinking about normalized earnings if we ex out all the charges because if I think \u2013 if I back out all the one-offs (16:02) in the second quarter, it implies you're earning about $1 of earnings. And if I think about the range of guidance it implies in the back half of the year you're anywhere between $0.70 and $0.90 each (16:14) quarter. So why is the second quarter over a $1 and the back half (16:20) run rate much lower than that or did something inflate (16:24) the second quarter?","My second question relates to the slide you guys sort of glossed over in terms of real estate footprint and corporate G&A expense. I mean it looks like there's a new cost savings program evolving here. So if you could provide a little color, it looks like there's lot of opportunity to reduce square footage, reduce corporate G&A and if you could give color on (16:47) how much NuScale could come down in 2019?","And then David I'll try one more time, when do we see an end to the problem projects?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Okay, Jamie I'll go ahead and start. [Technical Difficulty] (16:58) the phone is clipping your questions a little bit but I understand...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Yeah, we're hearing that on your end in the (17:05) prepared remarks. So I don't know if there's something wrong with the line.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Okay. Something wrong with the line here. Well, yeah just talking about guidance and where we are so we're holding to (17:14), of course we don't give quarterly guidance. We're holding to our $2.10 to $2.50 EPS range with the $2.30 midpoint. And you know from the first half to the second half of the year (17:26), for us we're guiding very simply, in the first half of the year (17:30) we delivered $0.68 with between the two quarters, and the second half of the year simply doing the math from the midpoint of (17:36) $2.30 we expect to deliver $1.62 in the last two quarters (17:39) of the year. But you know we're really not going to get into how that will fall in the quarters (17:45) because there is a lot of moving parts here, but we still are comfortable with our $2.30 midpoint.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","But why is the implied EPS ex (17:51) everything else north of (17:52) $1 in the second quarter, like I threw out there (17:54) was there a gain in the fourth quarter we don't know in E&C or is that just \u2013 it doesn't make sense given where you were, what the run rate is in the (18:04) back half?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Sorry, can you repeat that? (18:08), I apologize, Jamie, but you're getting really clipped. (18:09)","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","If I look at the second quarter and I add back the (18:13) problem projects, FX and Puerto Rico, earnings are about $1.06 or something like that dollar, okay. If I look at your guidance in the back half of the year, it implies, I don't know, $0.75 (18:29), so I'm just trying to figure out why the implied (18:33) run rate is going down or was there something inflating the second (18:37) quarter?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, certainly in the second quarter, we did get a huge benefit from the FX -","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No, I'm adjusting, I'm adjusting for that.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Okay. And from a run rate basis, we had a nice benefit from the Puerto Rico contract here as we closed it out. We don't expect any more earnings or maybe very limited earnings from the (18:54) contracts, so that's out of the portfolio. We did see pickups in mining (19:03) as well as E&C in the second quarter, but we have some \u2013 a lot of puts and takes in the second quarter like you said.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","And there is nothing inflating E&C margins, if we add back the $67 million in downstream?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Nothing, special, no.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. All right, sorry. And then just sorry on the cost [Technical Difficulty] (19:22) David on the problem projects, just how comfortable?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We're always looking at how do we [Technical Difficulty] (19:31) reduce our run rate. [ph] We've gone through a process (19:34) over the last couple of years of really [ph] what we (19:39) talked about in terms of disbursed execution and what we've done is we've been able to kind of stabilize that head count across the board. And there is two activities that we've undertaken; one is the densification effort, so that we're maximizing the square footage of the existing facilities. And then over the next few years, we're going to exit an existing facility [ph] in Houston and (20:07) build another one. And in doing so, we will [ph] reduce our footprint in Houston (20:14) from about 1.2 million square feet [ph] to about (20:16) 600,000. So yeah we're focused on overhead reduction and making sure that that [ph] we're as sharp as (20:26) we can be. On those two projects, I'll start [ph] with (20:34) the power project, [ph] I'll hold a weekly call with a (20:36) project team including the President of that group which is almost resident at the site.","I can't overstate the importance of first fire yesterday (20:49) because it supports the schedules that we have not withstanding the charge that we had. The charge that we had this quarter was missed [Technical Difficulty] (20:58) both in terms of material and labor associated with it which [ph] on other (21:05) projects that would have been handled by contingency and because this thing is out in lights everything stands out and that's why we had to announce it. I still believe that because of the schedule, there is a positive adjustment at the end of the year available to us assuming that we continue to perform. But my accounting friends have made us report it the way that we've reported it.","On the project (21:38) in Europe that project completed in September, again we're in negotiations with the (21:43) customer and I expect some relief associated with that write down that we took in the quarter. But that project is all but done. So, I think these legacy issues as we get to December will be \u2013 are (22:02) all behind us.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I am sorry, David. Back on the real estate (22:07) footprint, I mean is this something in terms of cost savings? Are you going to end up (22:11) quantifying this? Is it big enough to talk about and just too early? I am just trying to (22:14) to figure out.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","It's too early. We won't break (22:16) ground until probably mid-2019. (22:21) Our lease at the existing Sugar Land facility ends in, I think it's June of 2021. So, it's going to be significant \u2013 it won't be significant until we get to 2021.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you. I appreciate the color. I'll get back in queue.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","Operator","Thank you. And we'll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon. I just want to come back to the question about the E&C margin because if you do add back or [Technical Difficulty] (22:58) for the quarter, I know Bruce, you said there was nothing special in there. But then why would margins for the back half of the year then be implied at much lower rate? Or is that just some [ph] conservatism (23:13)?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, Steve, you kind of see (23:16) very high margins in the second quarter from margins that have been lagging that in (23:21) E&C in prior quarters. So, as we look forward into future quarters, we are still sticking to our (23:27) 6% to 7% range for the second half (23:30) and we think that's very reasonable, so.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","But I think that when you look to the future (23:39) we've talked about integrated solutions, we've talked about the things that we've been investing in and doing to change the model. And the question that you guys asked, I don't know four years ago was do you think you'll ever get back into the 6% margin range in E&C? And I believe because of what we've done, yes we're going to get back to 6%, and stay at 6% as we run through this next cycle. And as I said, we're on the early side of this cycle, and I believe the things that we've done and the pieces of projects that we're doing now that we were subcontracting before supports a higher margin going forward as we get into next year, and the year after.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. The E&C bookings were a bit light, just trying to [Technical Difficulty] (24:41) how much project deferral there is? And then kind of related, [ph] you last talked about (24:48) a potentially lower win rate going forward, so to what extent are you still seeing some aggressive bids that makes the lower rates still likely or have we sort of cleared the decks on that? And now what you're focused on is really all projects that you can be equally competitive with others out there?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, I feel pretty good about where we sit right now. You know, we've had some things shift from quarter-to-quarter still, some decisions being made. I think, there's a little bit of trepidation on our customers because of tariffs. You know, we've done the studies and we know what those \u2013 what (25:27) that impact could be. In most cases, it doesn't impact the client's model. So I think that our win rate will be more solid than maybe I've suggested in prior discussions.","A good line of sight in the second quarter and \u2013 I'm sorry third quarter and fourth quarter is awards (25:42) and pretty high confidence in hitting some big numbers in those two quarters. So as I said in my (26:03) prepared remarks, this is the first time we've seen a positive move in backlog since 2016, and I think you're going to see that that reality as we go through the next few quarters (26:20). But decisions are being made [Technical Difficulty] (26:23) confidence is maybe stronger than it was last quarter when I kind of maybe had a little bit too stern a warning. But we feel pretty good about where we're headed in this long awaited change in the cycle that we've [ph] talked about (26:43) and we're on the very beginning [ph] edge of that (26:44). I mean mining alone if you go to \u2013 what was it, close of year 2016, we had $800 million in backlog, and today we're over [ph] $4 million and projecting $6 billion to $8 billion (27:01). And I see the same change in trajectory, oil and gas and some of the other stuff. I think it's understated a little bit but, what the [ph] Government group has been able to (27:18) do with the laboratory community [ph] we believe (27:20) is tremendous.","And again you look at recurring revenues and earnings in our business is usually a very, very small percentage, and what we've been working on with the acquisition of Stork and with our focus on government is growing that recurring earnings, which just allows us to grow in this cycle bigger than we were in the last cycle. So if you're sensing a little bit of optimism more so than the last quarter, it's correct because we can see the awards that are in front of us.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. That's good to hear. Thanks very much.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Steven.","Operator","Thank you. And next we'll hear from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Just kind of (28:17) following along those lines, I think, it was asked (28:20) before but when you look at mining, LNG, (28:22) infrastructure this year, I mean, the visibility toward bookings for you guys is good, but you know, when compare this cycle to other cycles, and maybe you can give us perspective, right. So if we look at the 2013 and 2016 PetChem cycle, the 2011 mining cycle, you know, 2016 refining cycle. Do you think ultimately over the next three years, you're going to be able to book more work than those cycles, [Technical Difficulty] (28:51)?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah. Andy you breaking up. I'm sorry, we've got a bad line today. But I think the short answer to your question is yes. In the last call maybe I think, it was last call, we began the eighth year in January, the eighth year of downturn in terms of capital spending across the board. And we've been signaling the bottom for some time, well, we've seen the bottom (29:24) and the way I look at these cycles and what we've done on the integrated solutions (29:32) on \u2013 not just doing it [Technical Difficulty] (29:35) but just the skill sets around supply chain, our construction capability, our fabrication capability, I think, we've got a great opportunity to be a much bigger company in this cycle than we were in [ph] previous (29:51) cycles.","I was in China two weeks ago in our yard that is absolutely chock-a- (29:58) block full of modules for the Al-Zour power plant. And I'm telling you if you go and walk that site you can see why we did what we did and how successful we're going to be. There was 14 sailed out in May and they're fitting perfectly (30:26). So not only is the competitiveness of our offering proving out, but the quality of our offering is proving out. And I think that, that's only going to be an added benefit when you look at this next cycle and the projects that are in front of us and the customers that are looking to us (30:45) for surety in terms of cost and schedules. So, again I \u2013 you \u2013 just like Steven's comment, I'm pretty bullish on what we've invested in, it's just a shame that (30:57) this noise on legacy projects that have dampened some really good quarters over the last two years, and we've done everything in our power to lessen that risk, and better insight in surety in terms of our performance going forward.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, I know that there are connections. So let me just ask you sort of a concise question. Do you hit any more milestones on that checked in Europe to get over that hump there because I think it's the same project that you have issues on some time (31:36) ago.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We're in startup this quarter (31:41) basically the answer to that nothing stands in the way of a startup in their operation in September.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thanks guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question will come from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi, folks.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hi, Tahira.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So David can you talk a bit about what makes the integrated solution maybe for us who are not really from the industry maybe you can sort of highlight one or two elements that really help control the risk. And I see not only for yourselves, but throughout more E&C names (32:25), if there's a problem project there's a domino effect and stuff to control once there's a cost increase. Is there anything within the integrated solution model that does help prevent something like that?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I think in my prepared remarks the comment about 5% of the labor off the job site is key just because of the location. And regardless of where you are in the world, there is a limit on skilled capable crafts people, whether it's the Gulf Coast, the United States, the Middle East or anyplace else. So one of the risk mitigations is being able to put things in a controlled environment in terms of quality and safety and the things that go with it. Maybe other and this is a technical terms, so be prepared its one throat to choke. Our customers are looking for one company that they can look to, to deliver these assets. And more and more \u2013 most of our customers are looking past the unit rates and looking for total delivery. And that's what we're focused on, that's what we've invested and that's why I feel like in this cycle we've got the ability to connect the dots and there's no \u2013 there's no middleman that we've got to negotiate with. We can get things done in a more timely manner and make sure that we stay in sequence. In every one of the problem projects something has gotten out of sequence.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","And lots of reasons why, some is the customer, some is the equipment supplier and some is of our own fault (34:27) making sure you stay in sequence is the biggest risk mitigator to delivering cost and schedule (34:36).","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, David. That's actually pretty helpful. I guess [Technical Difficulty] (34:41) just in some of the LNG projects you're seeing out there, David. I saw that Woodside recently pulled out of one in the U.S. Are you seeing some reshuffling in terms of developers and where they want to be positioned. And does that change what you feel you're better positioned for?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","No, it doesn't change what we're targeting at all. You look at it LNG now and it's almost synonymous with the way the offshore market runs, where the beginning of exploratory wells, somehow the partners change. Either in percentages or completely changed out and I think you're going to see that in LNG. There's always going to be a leap and in some of the other companies are going to ebb and flow, so I don't see that as abnormal (35:37) and it certainly doesn't change the ones we're focused on.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, David.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And next, we'll hear from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Corinne Jenkins - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, this is Corinne Jenkins is on for Jerry Revich. So I was hoping you could talk a little bit more about the mining backlog, it sounds like you're expecting to have between $2 billion and $4 billion, so my assumption would be is that some pretty big projects. I was hoping you could talk about how quickly you'd expect those to ramp?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, yes, the one at Quellaveco, (36:09) that's been announced that \u2013 that you know we're on. It's a very large project. And then you know what you've got is a lot of replacement capacity type projects that are out there. You've seen the commodity price like I have, copper kind of leading the way. In most of those projects or things again that have been pushed to the right on the schedule because of capital needs and this kind of downside. Yeah, we're tracking. We're tracking a lot of very large projects and it's not just this year. I mean I think this is going to be a longer cycle in mining than maybe we've seen in the past.","Corinne Jenkins - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Thank you. And then on the infrastructure side, so you boast a couple of projects that they're public private partnership, could you just tell us if you're seeing that kind of work or if that's just a couple of one-offs?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","No, as I've said, before I think the public private partnership approach has to be the leading approach, if these studies are going to get done. I mean, you've seen that our Congress can't pass or even sign a good infrastructure bill, I think he's been pretty clear about what he wants and in both cases they've used PPP as the go to model. But federal government, state governments, they can't afford them, so you got to go to the private side to be able to fund them. And there is a lot of money sitting on the sidelines (37:47) waiting to fund these things. So financial closure on these things on a schedule that we expect is pretty high probability there. But as you can see with the LAX people move or Gordie Howe, all those things are starting to move forward. And there's several more kind of big programs that we're doing right now that they give us confidence that that business is going to continue to to grow (38:24). Now if the U.S. federal government can get their ducks in a row and pass a infrastructure bill, I think that supersize is the opportunity there.","Operator","And our next question will come from Andy Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks for taking my question. In the first quarter, the change in the revenue recognition didn't have really a material effect on your reported revenues or your profits, but looks like the 10-Q calls out that on a pre-tax basis it's about $30 million and most of that it says fell in the E&C segment. The missing piece to the \"gain\" that other analysts looking for, or is that level of impact from (39:16) revenue recognition supposed to stick around in the second half?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah. As you've seen in our Q (39:24), we have a revenue recognition, a narrative and it's got tables in it where we're comparing the current quarter old way versus new way and then year-to-date old way new way. And from that table, year-to-date we're a little over $21 million (39:41) in the rev rec column. So, as you remember, at the beginning, we reduced our retained earnings by about $340 million. And that's what then gets re-recognized on a basis consistent with rest of our people companies in the E&C industry recognized revenue. So, it's a slower burn but you don't get the engineering high margin and then the construction smoothes it out. So that $340 million will be burnt off over 3 plus years.","The challenge, of course, is how to predict what comes in (40:18) each quarter. First two quarters of this year are very reflective of that. In the first quarter, we were $1.2 million (40:25) and then $20 million in the second quarter, getting to $21 million, (40:18) $21.7 million in the table. So, we will see that inflection come and it will grow as time goes on. It's just a matter about how our contracts burn through each quarter and how much of that rev rec we pick up.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Yeah. So that all makes sense (40:46) but I guess maybe the question is, given it's lumpier, what's in the guidance? Are you expecting that to \u2013 in the first quarter, you said that for the year you don't (40:55) expect a material effect. We got a bit of material effect here in the second quarter. Is that going to be negative or flat? How are you thinking about it in the second half of the year but I think that might be the missing piece to the revenue or the EPS deceleration that people are trying to understand better?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, I said in the first quarter call, we're rolling the impact of rev rec into our overall guidance of our $2.10 to $2.50 now this year. And that is (41:21).","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Right so. Yeah, all right, are you expecting a (41:24) benefit in the third and fourth quarter revenue recognition?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, again, burning off the quarters we'll (41:32) see the impact by quarter. I've kind of fallen away from giving up [Technical Difficulty] (41:38) to provide guidance on that rev rec because it changes so much quarter-to-quarter. That's why we rolled it into our overall guidance.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. I'll \u2013 my next question is just on \u2013 we were thinking that there was going to be a payment for the Chinese fabrication venture that was due sometime (41:57) this summer, it was around [Technical Difficulty] (41:58). It didn't come in the quarter is it is third quarter or is that payment been delayed or somehow changed?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","It's been delayed. Basically we've invested as much as we can invest until the next projects come in. But there is an investment coming but it will be towards the end of the year. If not \u2013 it could slip into next year, but towards the end of the year.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Great, thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you and next we'll hear from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good evening, everybody, David. If 2019 booking opportunities accelerate and FIDs come through do you anticipate that maybe the market might \u2013 clients might start to speed up their awards just because they're going to run out of some [Technical Difficulty] (42:57) capacity, engineering capacity and could we get to the point where we saw like in the early cycles of 2006, 2007 where things really heat up if the economy stays strong and these energy projects finally get pushed through?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Michael, I think so. As I've said, they've pushed their spending both on the major maintenance and shutdown, turnaround kinds of things as well as on the capital side to the right for the last six, seven years. And they still have to do the same things to (43:34) meet their bogeys in terms of reserves, new product that they're looking to do, if you get back into the petrochemical side, mining side. One of the fears I have is, if you think back to that last cycle, it got a little pretty overheated in terms of those commodities, the engineering equipment, the building materials that we had. Hoping there's a little more structure and discipline in this cycle which I (44:11) signaled before. I'm hoping it doesn't (44:11) peak bigger than it was, I mean there's more [Technical Difficulty] (44:14) out there available now than there was in the last cycle to be \u2013 put a point on it. But I just think it's going to point to a longer period of that peak. But there's a lot of big projects that are lining up, and I feel really good about our position to capture our fair share.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","But with your integrated solutions and your new model, can that mitigate and actually benefit you if those environments pick up in a couple of years?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","That's the plan. (44:55)","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you. Secondly \u2013 No I \u2013 good answer. Follow-up is, take your temperature on NuScale, where we stand, there's been some interesting articles I've seen in the press last month or two on the prospects and how you're feeling and any timing relative to better visibility on getting off some of the expenses that we're seeing?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I'm pretty bullish about where we are. I mean we're the only small module reactor technology that's actually matured to a point [Technical Difficulty] (45:27). There's a lot of people talking about what they've got, but really all they've got something on a [ph] piece of paper (45:32). We've got equipment being built and tested to support the NRC [ph] requirements (45:39) and design certification.","So I feel pretty good about that, getting through that first phase which we did this last quarter puts us in a position where outside investors are starting to show interest. The Department of Energy has been very supportive of what we're doing and how we're doing it. And I think that we're headed towards what we expected, but as I said our expected investment was all (46:15) meant to be replaced by others and that's what we're looking for. And I put a lot of pressure on the NuScale team to actually do that and [Technical Difficulty] (46:30) the DoE is [ph] helping with that, (46:36) in terms of that match, and as I said [ph] there's (46:45) is peaking. So, I feel pretty [ph] good (46:48) that we're on our schedule, and I'm not willing to say what \u2013 how much less for 2019, but it'll be significantly less.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And, David I'll take under 8.5 wins this year. Thank you.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good luck. Who is your quarterback by the way?","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","That's the Cowboys I mean. Thank you.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Sorry.","Operator","And thank you. And I do apologize for some of the audio issues we're having. And we'll take our next question from Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi guys. Maybe I'll kick off with I don't know if you'll be willing to comment on 2019 growth prospects, but if I just look at your pipeline of projects, you should be ending the year with kind of double-digit backlog growth. Can you comment on how quickly can you convert it into revenue, if it's a double-digit backlog growth. Can we expect double-digit revenue growth next year? Any color you can provide around kind of burn rate on backlog?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, I'm probably not going to get too deep into that. The new rev rec approach smoothes things. So in previous times, we would have been doing the engineering early which [Technical Difficulty] (48:10) margin than the [ph] construction did (48:13). So that fast ramp up and peak won't match the last cycle, I guess is the way I would categorize it, but these projects are starting quick and we are burning percent complete [ph] more (48:34) quickly than we did in previous cycles. So, I wouldn't predict double-digit but I think we've got a good growth story and we'll obviously give you more of that type of detail when we have our Investor Day.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","That's helpful. And maybe switching to free cash flow. Any comment on what the outlook could be for the second half, it's been coming a little bit weaker than I would have expected. Is it just where you are in the project cycle, is it just some of the problem projects just taking some of the free cash flow out of your company. How do you expect the ramp of free cash flow through the rest of the year?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","So Anna, pretty straightforward, free cash flow is equal to net income. So as we see our net income growing, that's going to be all [Technical Difficulty] (49:23) cash coming in and as we see the growth in the second half [Technical Difficulty] (49:26) both in our revenue and earnings burn that's going to really help our [Technical Difficulty] (49:30). But certainly our focus [Technical Difficulty] (49:35) build that U.S. cash balance. That's why we're providing visibility in the MD&A and in our disclosures here [ph] is one (49:42) you to track it right along with us. But no, that's [ph] where our free cash \u2013 we see our (49:46) free cash increasing as the year goes on and [ph] well, even more so (49:50) into 2019.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","The opportunity for upside to come above 100% conversion with some of the prepayments on projects, kind of what are the potential upsides or downsides to free cash flow relative to your net income in the second half?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Clearly, as we win these big projects, the customer advance [Technical Difficulty] (50:11). And right now, we're not really planning on the upside of customer advances because we do keep that earmarked for the projects, a lot of [Technical Difficulty] (50:19) but we do. But that does very much drive our cash balance and you'll see that in our free cash flow.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question will come from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good evening guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hi, Chad.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. So, David, you shared where you thought mining backlog is exiting the year to (50:43) $6 billion to $8 billion. I was wondering if you could do the same thing for oil and gas. Then also it seems like the LNG cycle is kicking into full gear here with the LNG Canada win. I'm just trying to get a sense for how you think about the comfort level with carrying multiple LNG projects. Should the opportunity actually arise?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, I think we shared the backlog today, it sits with E&C at about $12 billion. The previous peak was about double that. And I think we can grow past that in this cycle. I'm not going to give you the number but I think that significant growth over that 24 (51:23) is available to us in this cycle. With regard to LNG, yeah, you're right. It's starting to percolate here with that win, is a big win for us. But I remind you that we're teamed with [Technical Difficulty] (51:43). So we're leveraging their resources, not just Fluor resources and we'll continue to [Technical Difficulty] (51:49).","They have had more than \u2013 I don't know what the peak was but certainly [Technical Difficulty] (51:56) [ph] 2 or 3 (51:57) in their backlog at one time in the last cycle. I'm not uncomfortable with the same number as we get into the cycle. I said though, I think it's going to be a little bit longer cycle this time. So, when you think about LNG Canada, as an example, you've got about 12 to 18-month design cycle and those people will start to become available nine months into the process.","So as you can see based on timing, we could have several in the backlog at the same time as long as their percent of (52:22) completion, fits the resource (52:41). But the good thing about Fluor and when you do have those big projects, is you attract the best and brightest. We've proven that over our history and again in this cycle we'll do that again. I think with the discipline around the design systems that we've changed, some of the predictive tools that we've got and the added capabilities that we have in terms of supply chain construction, fabrication, give us better \u2013 bigger bandwidth in this cycle than we've had in previous cycles.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. And just really quickly on diversified services, it seems like the backlog continues to tick down in that business. And I'm just curious whether you're starting to see \u2013 whether you're close to the bottom or any green shoots, and how you're thinking about timing for that business picking up from bookings perspective?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah. I would [Technical Difficulty] (53:44) some of the businesses within Stork, and some of the [Technical Difficulty] (53:47) on the Flour, of the historic Fluor side. As I mentioned, most of those customers in oil and gas, and in mining and everybody else stopped spending. And we're seeing a tremendous [ph] uptick (54:04) in terms of those major [ph] maintenance projects, those (54:06) turnarounds and shutdowns. So the 2019, 2020, 2021, [ph] I think we'll (54:13) I see them grow pretty rapidly frankly, as those projects come up. As you know, there's a lot of assets on the ground that need to be maintained. And I think that our business model allows us to do that for those customers as well.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks. I'll pass it along.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Chad.","Operator","And as there are no further questions in the queue. We'll turn it back to over the presenters for final comments.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, operator. I'll attempt to close us out here. As we moved, as I've said into the second half of (54:53) 2018 there's a number of signs that the cycle is pivoting from this multi-year trough in my conversations (55:00) with the customers, they're optimistic but measured in their efforts to move some of these projects forward. They can deliver value across the range of the economic cycles. Our clients are being thoughtful in which firms they engage, and they're looking at more than just an E&C provider, they're looking for strong capability in the functions, but that can deliver (55:26) in terms of cost and schedule. They [Technical Difficulty] (55:30) into focus on characteristics other than the lowest EPC bid.","We are approaching this next cycle differently than we have the prior cycles. We made (55:45) progress in the past few years and transformed the company (55:30) from a transactional reimbursable model to [Technical Difficulty] (55:52) supports collaboration and allows our company to bring innovative solutions to each and every project on which we work.","I thank you all for participating in the call today and greatly appreciate your support in Fluor.

With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcements was released this afternoon after market closed. And we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we'll reference while making prepared remarks.","But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on slide two. During today's call and slide presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today.","During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now I'd turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Geoff. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us here today. Before we get into specifics on our second quarter performance, I'd like to share a bit about our perspective on the markets we serve and the actions we're taking, continue to take, strengthen our performance, and strengthen our competitiveness.","At the time of our April earnings call, commodity prices were recovering and expectations of a gradually improving global economy gave us confidence that we could achieve the financial goals for strong growth that we set out last October. Since then we've seen a shift in the supply and demand curves leading to lower pricing, especially on crude oil and some specific metals.","This is a result of excess supply compounded by slow economic growth and uncertainty in multiple markets. Even with these challenges, we continued to record oil and gas backlog near all-time highs and are well-positioned for robust slate of opportunities. In fact, today we received an award letter for two packages for the new KNPC al-Zour refinery and we expect to book our portion of this $5.8 billion project into backlog during the third quarter. While I'm particularly pleased with the performance and results in oil and gas, weakness in our non-oil and gas end markets persist.","In mining and metals, ongoing weakness in iron core and copper are now pushing opportunities that we considered 2015 prospects into 2016. With regard to infrastructure, competition continues to be aggressive and a lack of long-term funding solutions is limiting the near-term opportunities. In power, we continued to win our fair share of U.S. combined cycle build out even in a highly competitive environment. And we are optimistic about the improved regulatory uncertainty that it will drive a number of opportunities over the next several years.","Overall, there is a slower pace of project awards. The end result is a relatively flat backlog in the aggregate as opposed to the growth we had planned for in October. While it's not what anyone wants, we will manage through this. That's why the path we've been on for the last three years to improve Fluor's competitiveness and why an improved offering of truly integrated solutions is so important. This is an environment we have prepared for. The measures we have taken \u2013 have been taken have been well-planned and well executed.","We made fundamental shifts in our construction and fabrication offerings to drive profitable growth for our company and to improve control and delivery at the project level. Of equal importance, we've aligned our businesses leadership and employees to offer broader, more cost-effective array of Fluor assets and capabilities to our customers. We will continue to look for opportunities to enhance the offerings we provide to our customers and provide profitable growth for Fluor.","I'm pleased to say that this approach has helped us change over time. As a result, we're not faced with the need to take extreme measures driven by economic uncertainty, which I believe can be disruptive.","This afternoon, we announced the strategic joint venture with Sacyr in Spain. This new JV will \u2013 allows us to expand geographically into select regions with a proven construction partner. Historically, we've been successful in expanding work through joint ventures including our highly productive JV in Mexico, and expect to do more in the future. In many cases, this requires investment on our part, however, with Sacyr, this was achieved by selling 50% of our interest in our Spanish-based business.","Now let's look at the second quarter results and begin on slide three. Net earnings attributable to Fluor for continuing operations were $149 million or $1 a share \u2013 diluted share. Consolidated segment profit for the quarter was $282 million. Segment profit represents a 21% increase in Oil & Gas results compared to a year ago, offset by the decline in our Industrial & Infrastructure, Power and Global Services segments.","Segment profits \u2013 segment profit margins were 5.9% level with our 6% a year ago. With Oil & Gas margins at 7.4%, up from 5.9% in the second quarter 2014, and consistent with the results from last quarter.","Margins in Oil & Gas reflect favorable performance on projects progressing towards completion and an increase in higher margin engineering and design activities. Revenues for the quarter were $4.8 billion. New awards for the quarter were $4.3 billion including $2.7 billion in Oil & Gas, $726 million in Government, and $607 million in Industrial & Infrastructure.","Consolidated backlog at quarter-end improved to $41.6 billion compared to the $41.2 billion last year. We have had no cancellations on major projects this quarter and only a minimal impact on backlog due to foreign exchange fluctuations.","Our financial results are summarized on the table in slide four, and I'll continue my remarks on slide five. In the second quarter, the Oil & Gas segment booked $2.7 billion in new awards, as I mentioned, including additional refining work in Europe and a new production and chemical programs in Canada. Ending backlog for Oil & Gas segment rose 18% from a year ago to $28.7 billion. New awards for the quarter in Industrial & Infrastructure were $607 million, primarily related to new work for the industrial services customer. Ending backlog for Industrial & Infrastructure declined to $6.7 billion from $9.1 billion a year ago, as we continue to work off the existing mining projects.","Commodity prices remain a challenge for this business line, and we are seeing some prospects that were slated as I said for 2015 award pushed into 2016. On the Infrastructure side, although a long-term federal funding solution continues to be abated, (8:33) I'm pleased to report that a Flour led JV won the Bergstrom Expressway Project in Austin, Texas. We expect to book this project in the third quarter as well.","Turning to slide six, revenue for the Government group was $607 million, similar to the results a year ago. Second quarter new awards were $726 million, and included another task order award for services we provide under the LOGCAP IV contract in Afghanistan. Ending backlog was $4.3 billion, down from $5.2 billion a year ago.","In the Power segment, second quarter awards were $253 million, and included a new maintenance services contract for Luminant's Comanche Peak nuclear facility in Texas. Ending backlog is $1.9 billion, which was comparable to $1.7 billion a year ago.","With that I'll now turn the call over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance, and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Thanks, David. Good afternoon, everyone. I want to start by providing some additional comments on our performance for the second quarter, then move to the balance sheet. Please turn to slide seven. As David mentioned, EPS from continuing operations for the second quarter was $1 compared to $1.02 a year ago. Foreign exchange rates were slight negative on earnings for the quarter.","Corporate G&A expense for the second quarter was $48 million compared to $57 million a year ago. This year-over-year decline was primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense. Shifting to the balance sheet, Fluor's financial condition remains strong with cash plus current and non-current marketable securities totaling $2.1 billion. This compares to $2.7 billion a year ago.","Cash flow from operations was $165 million for the quarter. During the quarter, the company returned over $134 million in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Over the last three quarters, we have repurchased $700 million of shares. We remain on track to complete our $1 billion share repurchase program by the end of this year.","Moving to slide 8, Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $41.6 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 16% at quarter end and a mix by geography was 34% U.S., and 66% non-U.S.","Before we take questions, I'll conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for the remainder of 2015, which is on slide 9. We continue to win a number of front-end engineering awards, particularly in Oil & Gas. However, relatively low new awards this year and the deferral of investment decisions due to volatile commodity prices is placing pressure on our expected results for 2015. After taking into consideration these factors, the company is reducing its 2015 guidance range of $4.50 to $5 per diluted share to $4.05 to $4.35 per diluted share.","The range presumes completion of our announced $1 billion share repurchase program by end of the year, an effective tax rate of 33% to 35%, G&A for the full year of $180 million to $190 million, and the closing of our sale of 50% of Fluor Spain. The guidance excludes the effects of previously announced termination and settlement of Fluor's U.S. defined benefit pension plan, which is expected in the latter part of 2015.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. At this time, we'll take our first question from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Hi. Good evening.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good evening.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I guess a couple questions. One, the Oil & Gas revenues we've seen declines over the past couple of quarters; I think you're expecting sort of more flattish. If you could just comment on what's going on there; is it the projects that are in backlog, the burn rate is lower than what you would have thought? Is it push outs in \u2013 what's in backlog? Just if you could give more color there in how we think about that for the remaining half of the year?","The second question relates to profitability in Oil & Gas and Industrial & Infrastructure, which on the positive continues to surprise on the upside. David, I think, last quarter you said high 6% for Oil & Gas; it's \u2013 at third quarter we're at 7%. And I think you also said I&I margins from 4% to 5%, where again you guys are consistently above that range. So I'm wondering if we structurally should think about profits at higher levels than you've been guiding to.","And then sorry, my last question is for you, David, with regards to \u2013 obviously you don't want to talk about 2016 right now, but I think the market is embedding or assumes that numbers are going to be down \u2013 EPS will be down next year, which I agree, just given the push outs we're seeing in backlog. But the question is, we can make our own assumptions on the market, is there anything you're considering or that you can do internally to help the EPS growth or actions that you can take, whether it's some restructuring on the G&A line, whether it's we should think about you guys continuing to be disciplined buying back your stock or perhaps there's other markets you're more optimistic on, that could help the top-line? Thanks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Those are lots of questions.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","I know. I know. Sorry.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, in terms of revenue, I think it's just the time of where we are in those projects. We've got a fair amount of projects that are just going to the field, where you're going to see the revenues I think tick up in terms of Oil & Gas in the second half of the year and as we go into 2016, so it's basically a timing thing. As I said, we have had no cancellations. It's just where we are in the cycle of these projects. So I would just \u2013 I wouldn't read anything into that; I think you'll see Oil & Gas revenues improve.","In terms of margin, and I'm going to answer part of the last question first. We've spent the last three years really looking at our competitiveness. And as I've mentioned, we took over $100 million out of our overhead last year in terms of becoming more competitive, and we did it in a very measured way, and we didn't take a restructuring charge. We just did these things as a normal course of our business, which puts us I think in a much better position to weather this storm in terms of the other businesses, but also be more competitive in the marketplace. And I think we're seeing that. Embedded in that higher level of competitiveness is, I think, just a difference in our profit expectations.","So, yes, I kind of gave you the high 6%s and we're obviously over the 7%. I think that going forward, you're going to see us continue to perform very well in that segment. I think in terms of Industrial & Infrastructure, we've had some completions, and again it's just operating off of a smaller base, and you don't have the huge mining projects going through with the CFM burning as well, and obviously that's one way that the margins in Industrial & Infrastructure stay at a much higher level than the traditional number, when you've got mining blowing through there.","So I think we're in a great position, in terms of being able to deliver profitability. Unfortunately it's on a much smaller base in the non-oil and gas pieces of our business. I'm really proud of what we've done in terms of kind of rightsizing this company and preparing for these types of situations. It's just that, as I said, the mining projects and some of the other things that are pushed out have created a little bit of headwind in terms of where we thought we would be. But I am very pleased with what we've done in terms of structure. I am very pleased with the way we're performing.","And the fact that we have no cancellations I think also kind of speaks to the conservatism that we have in taking projects in and the things we need to see before we put those things into backlog. So, I think all-in-all we kind of changed the company to where we should deliver a higher level of profitability going forward. I'm not going to suggest a percent specific in terms of Oil & Gas or anything else, but I don't think you'll see us return to those low-margin days of five or so years ago. We've really been disciplined in how we're going forward and we'll continue to do so.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","And I know I'm pushing the limit here, but any \u2013 just broadly 2016 \u2013 my question there in terms of repurchase or any actions that you can take to help the bottom line or \u2013 I mean, it doesn't sound there's much more you can do on the restructuring side because that's been done?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's been done, Jamie. I wouldn't really want to get into 2016. I think, it's clear that if our new awards in the other businesses are down in 2015, the earnings in 2016 will be challenged. But I think from a margin perspective and being good stewards of that money and making sure we're doing the rights things and being balanced and not making silly decisions that we tend to see in this type of a market circumstance, you'll continue to see us perform.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","All right. Thanks so much. I'll get back in queue.","Operator","This time we'll take a question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Good afternoon and good evening.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","David, I wonder if you could just update us on your views on the ethylene cycle. How many more crackers do you think move forward this year, and next year it feels like we're having one wave after another at least coming to the forefront, how many more do you think move forward and how many of them are you folks bidding on?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're focused on all of them. When you look at that next wave, I think, there's a good three or four of them in that next wave, and then I think there is a wave after that. I think, the interesting thing is we're in the middle of building three of them right now and it's going to take some time for us to finish those, so the gas starts to get used. But I see our petrochemical customers being very bullish on CapEx, but again they're in the same markets that the oil and gas guys are, and in some cases it's the same companies and they're curtailing capital. So I think there's a little bit of a timing element in when these things come to market that maybe we didn't see a year ago. But I think there is that end, as well as the derivative chemical plants that we're focused on are also things that we're obviously keen to win. So, I think, it's a good market for us, and I think, we're well positioned to get hopefully more than our fair share.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And David, in Power you mentioned now that the uncertainty has gone, projects are moving forward. Can you just give us a sense of your views on the cadence, how many projects do you think move forward within the next 12 months to 24 months, just flesh out you visibility for us, if you could?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There is numerous gas-fired combined cycle plants being planned and we're focused on a lot of them. We've got three that we're working on right now in varying stages, two with Duke and one with Dominion that the final notice to procedure on that project is not even in backlog yet. So I would argue that there is 10 to 20 on the books that will happen over the next probably five years, or at least, they'll go to limited notice to proceed in the next five years. So, I think we've got kind of a good solid earnings stream ahead of us in terms of gas plants, and the replacement of some of the coal fleet that's been planned.","When you look at the power margin there \u2013 power production margin, it still hasn't gotten to the point where it's putting pressure on these companies to put more capacity online. So I think we got to see some macro things happen in terms of the economy and people starting to build other things to use up the power margin to where they have to do that. So it's kind of replacing coal and it's also capacity and the capacity side isn't supporting a rapid advance of those projects.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And lastly, any opportunities on the wind and solar side as a result of that increased visibility too, I know you folks have a pretty good market share when those projects move forward?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're looking at potential solar, there's not a whole lot of wind under bid right now, and I think the reality of the cost curves on wind is kind of taking the wind out of their sails so to speak, but \u2013 sorry for that pun.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That was good.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, the solar side is continuing to do quite well, we're kind of finishing up on that first wave now.","Jerry David Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we'll move to Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks. Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Clearly you still have some chunky Oil & Gas projects coming in like KNPC. I mean what do you see as the trajectory of Oil & Gas backlog over the next several quarters? I mean it sounds like it \u2013 probably we should be expecting it to come down if your revenue burn is going to be picking up, but I guess I'll start with that and then, what's the kind of visibility you have to when it could start to tick back up again?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it could tick back up by the end of the year, I wouldn't say demonstrably so, but certainly there is things that we see right now that could provide an increase in backlog year-over-year. I think, as I mentioned, you're going to see revenues increase, but I don't think it's going to increase as fast as maybe you think in terms of depleting backlog. KNPC's big project, there're several other things there, there's big programs that will be \u2013 will go to FID this year. Obviously, going to backlog either late this year, early next year that could actually grow backlog in Oil & Gas.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Is Tengizchevroil, one of the key prospects that you're still kind of including in that list to move the needle, for this year?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, that's in there for that period of time, I wouldn't say when they're going to go to FID, because that's really up to our customer.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then, maybe broadening up Jerry's question how would you characterize the activity and prospects in the Gulf Coast at this point relative to other parts of the world? Is there still more confidence in this region given sort of the feedstock dynamics or is it just sort of broad customer caution everywhere?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, it's broad caution everywhere. I think, the programs and plans that for the Gulf Coast that have been planned, some of them have been pushed to the right. But they've been pushed to the right because of the macroeconomic stuff, not because of a cooling on the region specifically. That's a great place for us to work. We've got a great workforce, access to some of the best and brightest on the craft side. And with those projects under construction right now, we're actually growing our capability quite well, which bodes well for us longer-term in other industries when we got that kind of labor force available to us. The Texas, Louisiana specifically are two really great states to \u2013 for people to invest in economically. So I don't see anything slowing. The attitude around that region is just that broad fear factor that's out there in terms of capital deployment.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks very much.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we will move to Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yes. Hi. Good afternoon.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Hey, Biggs, just a question about the backlog, when I just do the natural math taking previous quarters backlog, I add the orders that you recognize, take out the revenue; suggest that the Q2 balance sheet should be about $900 million to a $1 billion less than what you reported. And I think it's specifically in Oil & Gas, was there any scope changes in the quarter that we should be aware of, or what might be the other drivers to that?","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yeah, you need to \u2013 and we laid out in the 10-Q when we do the roll forwards on backlog, you can see what adjustments to backlog are. Though still on the difference between new awards and what's burned, but there's numbers of adjustments, that almost always are.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","So, it's probably just scope changes that don't show up in orders?","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Typically, yeah. Typically, there's scope changes that roll in there.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. Got it. And just secondly, clarification just on the projects you announced that you discussed will be booked in Q3, the al-Zour and Bergstrom, the $5.8 billion is that the total scope for the consortium or is that your take?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. That's total consortium.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","And your take would be how much?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Between 35% and 40%.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Okay. And same thing with the Texas project?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes, we're I think 50% of that.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Got you. If I could just ask one more question, just there's been more discussion about oil staying lower for longer rather than \u2013 a more meaningful recovery that had been hoped for previously. Have you kind of stressed your backlog if that is, in fact, the case do you see any vulnerabilities to projects that are currently in backlog or projects that are in the pipeline?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","None in backlog. Going forward, I think, this goes back to some discussion that we've had in previous calls and in our Investor Day stuff. We're pretty \u2013 we're pretty focused on the projects that have a high degree of go. They'll actually be approved in an FID and that \u2013 those things are going to be based on the economics of low oil prices or high oil prices. So, when I look at what's in front of us, I think, if it shifts further to the right, it's more the macro fear factor in terms of capital deployment, not because these projects that we're chasing don't \u2013 no longer \u2013 they no longer meet the financial hurdles in their models. So we feel pretty good about the pipeline that's in front of us and certainly there is nothing in our backlog that we really have a fear in being cancelled.","Brian Konigsberg - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Yeah. Thank you very much.","Operator","Moving forward, we'll hear from Alex Rygiel with FBR.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Thank you. Good evening, David.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Alex.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","Could you give us a quick update on NuScale, and then also talk a little bit about pipeline opportunities? I know you're working on one in Mexico, but anything else that's developing in the market of pipelining?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, we're also working on one in Canada as well, and I think that's going to be a pretty good market going forward. There are some really big pipelines around the globe and we've got a group that's specifically focused on that. So we see that as part of that growth story in Oil & Gas. I'm sorry the first question?","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","NuScale, just give us an operational and financial update.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. We're on target for our submission of our design certification in mid to late 2016. We've got an Investor Day coming up in October \u2013 August, in August, sorry. In August, that I hope you folks can go to. I know some people have visited there. We've had, I would say, very good interaction with our advisory group, which is made up of many of our customers.","There are several customers that are looking at deploying our technology as it works through the system. We've had conversations, at least early conversations with some people that have expressed interest in investing in NuScale, and we're also looking at opportunities of deploying it outside the United States. So the interest is growing, we're on target for what we've done. The spin rate is about the same this year as last year, and will be again next year as we close in on submission of the design certification. So we're on target is the way I would categorize it.","Alex J. Rygiel - FBR Capital Markets & Co.","That's great. Thank you.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would just add that the spin rate is up this year, but it is covered significantly by the DOE, so when you look at it on a net basis, it's not as much of an increase.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Michael Dudas with Sterne Agee.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","Good evening, everybody.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Michael.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","David, could you \u2013 I don't know if you want to parse it this way, but as you readjust your expectations for the second half of the year and into 2016, do you think it's more global macro or more oil price?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think it's more global macro. I mean oil price is \u2013 you can argue that you would have seen a significant drop in our Oil & Gas backlog, and you wouldn't have seen the new awards that we've been able to produce in Oil & Gas and we wouldn't have won KNPC if the Oil & Gas guys were just sitting on their hands, doing nothing. They're still looking at the projects that make good economic sense at the pricing that they have.","So you would \u2013 intuitively you would think that you would see a significant drop in oil and gas that we're frankly not seeing and as my previous comment earlier on the call, we anticipate to see backlog actually grow over the next three quarters to four quarters in Oil & Gas. So, it's more the commodity prices in mining, it's some of the timing of some of the other capital around global services, a large piece of that is AMECO, which is very heavily \u2013 our equipment company is very heavily involved in the mining sector. So it's more the global macro that we're dealing with than one specific market, and specifically the oil and gas market.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","I appreciate that. And I guess, a follow-up, are you \u2013 you seem to be obviously have been pleased with the cost restructuring and the selling efforts of your company. But is there prospect for the non-energy side of your business to position itself to better participate when the global macro gets to feel better maybe in 2016 and beyond, and any strategies on to do that?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. We've right-sized, I think, the organization. We've made some changes in personnel. We've streamlined decision making such that I think we're in a much better position to more rapidly address those opportunities when they come along. We don't pull-in our \u2013 we don't pull-in when we get to a bad market like this. This is when our clients need us and this is when we step-up our efforts with our customers that are in challenging situations.","So I feel good about where we are and where we will be when those things change, but I'm \u2013 it's interesting, Michael, I've been through these cycles before and I actually see this cycle like I've seen the others. This is actually an opportunity that we're going to seize and it's in terms of how we deal with our customers and bettering those relationships. It's sharpening our approach and delivery. It's adding to our repertoire of skill set. So I'm always been a glass is half-full guy, and that kind of leads some of my thinking, but I look at this as a buying opportunity as opposed to some dark cloud.","Michael S. Dudas - Sterne Agee CRT","I appreciate it. Thank you, David.","Operator","Next question will be from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Hi. Thank you. Hi, folks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Tahira, how are you?","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I'm fine, thank you. Got a bit of interference going on, sorry. The first question is, if you look at your infrastructure project pipeline and you've seen quite a few large, nice awards over there as well. To the extent there's an infrastructure bill that does get approved, David, does that really serve as a swing factor on \u2013 within your Industrial & Infrastructure business; could it really help into the next year?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely. Well, I don't know about into the next year, but it absolutely helps our Infrastructure business. It all depends on the timing. I think a Highway Bill is way overdue. The question I think that's in front of everybody is who is going to pay for it, and I think that debate is going to take some time to shake out. But clearly that would really help us, in terms of the number of projects that are out there and the timing of those would be helpful. So again, just like my \u2013 part of my answer to Michael, we're prepared and are actually actively in discussion with several of the entities that'll be first movers, if in fact there's some funding available for those programs. So, we feel good about where we are from a position standpoint, but that's one of those markets where it's been highly competitive and I think people have had to do some things in terms of pricing that simply we're not willing to do. So, I feel good about our position.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, David. And second question is BP had a pretty interesting call the other day and it seemed to concur with what you're saying in terms of the economics of projects at $60. It seems that they're pretty close to really pulling the trigger even to some extent. But within that, it seems that there's a lot of deflation on average for each project. It seems a lot of that is not really tied to what you all do on the services side. But we'd love to get an idea from you, to the extent you can, as you're helping all these companies out with the supply chain, clearly the scope of these projects might be coming down. So, how should we think about the optics of backlog? Does that \u2013 could you see backlog sort of slide down, but the dollar profitability within that hold out for yourselves?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think there is \u2013 I think, projects \u2013 any time you're in this kind of cycle, projects get cheaper due to supply chain, and I think, we'll see some of that in the near-term, but I don't see that impacting how that flows in our books other than the revenue side. It doesn't impact really the profitability per se. I think the maturity of our supply chain and what we've done over the last few years, I believe, puts us in a better position to be more competitive as well as deliver lower cost projects to our customers. So again, I go back to what we've been focused on in the last three years, is actually fortuitous in terms of how we will be able to face the marketplace. But I think that many of these projects when the shocks of the $60 oil or $50 oil is over, they start to look at well, I think, we can get these things done cheaper and that's kind of what we're focused on trying to be able provide to our customers.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Thank you, David.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Operator, are there any more question?","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi. I was wondering if the $40 million gain that was mentioned in the Q for the sale of the Spanish joint venture is included in the guidance range \u2013 in the updated guidance range or if that's excluded.","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","I had it in my comments that the sale of Fluor Spain is considered in the guidance range. The \u2013 it's maybe a little more complex than just taking the $40 million number as an EBIT number and that's really tax affected of course, but as we disclosed in the Q, the final gain is subject to a determination of the fair value of the business and there really that's the fair value of the joint venture going forward. So there is some work to be done there, and the appraisal has to take place, before we probably determine what that gain is.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Is that tax rate closer to like a 20% numbers or is that more done at the corporate average tax rate?","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, that's a good question, that's one of the things that has to be nailed down between now and when we finally record it. The easy thing to do is tax affected at the U.S. statutory rate, but that's not necessarily going to be the final answer.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. Okay. That makes sense. And then just given the moving pieces inside of I&I backlog, Biggs, I was hoping you could give us just an update about that. How much of the I&I backlog is still mining versus transportation versus the other work that you do in there just to give us some sense about with the mining market being what it is. How long that could be an overhang?","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Sure, the mining number is around $1.4 billion. So that is way down from what it was a couple of years ago, reflective of how much that has fallen off and back to David's point earlier that that's one of the reasons why margin rate in the business is in that 5% to 6% range for the year.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah. And then David you started your comments at the beginning of the call talking about that you're seeing kind of oversupply that's affecting price. Could you maybe just talk a little bit more about those price and maybe even the risk terms that are in the marketplace today, maybe on jobs that you've decided to not be as fully aggressive as others have been. And what the potential downside would be if you chase those. I think given the market conditions, I think, this is something that long-term shareholders should be focused on. And like to hear your perspective on that?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. I mean, my earlier comments were more around the commodity supply and demand.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Price issues that we're dealing with and the eagerness or lack thereof of our customers actually take some of these projects to FID in the short-term. I think that just like in other times, we see some people that are not as diverse as us, make decisions to take risks or to take projects at pricing that is lower than we're interested at doing, that's a norm in this industry. I wouldn't say that I've seen it in as be as predatory as I have seen it in past cycles. So, hopefully there's a little bit more discipline in the industry in terms of getting the kind of return you should expect to the services that we provide our customers. But going any deeper than that I don't think is something I'd like to do.","Andrew J. Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)","All right, I'll leave it there. Thank you very much.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we'll take a question from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, this is Chad Dillard on for Vishal. Just wanted to dig more into the Power margins. They are a bit negative for this quarter and just want to see what you have in your backlog and whether you can drive it back positive and if not do you have any latitude to take some cost out of the business to right size that?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, you really need to look at the Power margins with and without NuScale, the NuScale expenses are what creates the fluctuation there. Without those the power margins are positive and we would expect them to stay positive. Of course they are a little bit lower than historical. For Power, we think over time they'll come back up as projects mature, as new projects come online, but for right now, they're going to run a little bit lower than traditional.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And just moving to the Government side of the business, can you just talk about what you're seeing in your pipeline and how many opportunities that you expect to have on bid and what the timing is for that?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. They've been very active on the construction side in terms of the DOE and DOD. As we said in previous calls, I mean coming off of LOGCAP highs is a big hole to fill. But I think that organization has done a really good job of kind of changing the model and adding more of the DOE type projects in. I think, the strategic petroleum reserve is probably the best example of that as well as Paducah that we've taken in over the last two quarters. So I think we're in a kind of a steady state kind of a position right now. We are one of the \u2013 we continue to be one of the key suppliers to the U.S. military in several places around the globe.","Obviously, Afghanistan and the troop head count that has been discussed by the U.S. is staying higher than was at least initially discussed, and that bodes well for us. They're also kind of moving things around which is also additional work for us. So I feel pretty good about where they are in terms of being able to provide a pretty steady state business going forward and unfortunately when we have very positive spikes, it's because of some strife in the world. I don't think the strife in the world is going to be reduced over the next little while, and I think that we're there to support the U.S. and other country militaries when they deploy.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","Yuri Lynk with Canaccord Genuity has the next question.","Yuri J. P. Lynk - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Hi. Good evening, guys.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good evening.","Yuri J. P. Lynk - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","David, you booked some Canadian work in the quarter in Oil & Gas, which I thought was interesting given kind of ground zero for the oil price impact. How would you characterize activity in Canada right now in terms of prospects and pricing. And specifically could you give us an update on Kitimat and your activity there?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First on Kitimat, we're continuing to help Chevron with the scoping and early design, some of the early works is continuing, but clearly that project's full FID is sometime out, but we continue to work and support that customer. And I think when you listen to the Chevron calls, they're still bullish on the project, and I guess their new partner is in and participating with us as well. So it's a slow go, but it's still moving along as we anticipated. You know, Canada, you're right, it's kind of ground zero, but what we're seeing is some of the heavy crude upgrading still going forward and actually using the existing capacities that have been built. I think in term of new developments on oil sands it's probably not going to happen in the near term, but it's still \u2013 there's a still big robust refining and petrochemical market there, that will continue to serve us.","But I think Canada, I mean in general, as you said, it's kind of ground zero, from an oil play standpoint and we don't see a whole lot of head room in term of new capacity, oil sands capacity there in the near term.","Yuri J. P. Lynk - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Okay. That's great color. Maybe if I could sneak another one in on the government section segment obviously, great job rebuilding the backlog there. The margins have been a little bit weaker than I was expecting, but we did see last year a nice tick up in the back half of the year. So, number one is there some seasonality to those margins, such that we might see some sequential improvement. And secondly, just is the overall margin profile of backlog that much lower than what we would have had in the past? Thanks.","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Okay. On the \u2013 it's Biggs. On the first question of Government margins, the Afghanistan work was a higher margin business that got converted to a fixed rate basis several quarters back and that reduced some of the fluctuation that had occurred over time in that business. The other thing is it created some fluctuation in that businesses. There is always a set of issues to be resolved with respect to regulatory matters on the Government side, and we've been very successful with respect to those, but those create blips in time that we have to talk about from quarter-to-quarter, periodically. From a going forward basis then, yes, the margin rates right now, I think, over the near-term are going to be lower than what they have been on average historically, because the Afghanistan work has come out. And then, it varies a lot based upon the mix and whether or not we have joint ventures, whether we're sharing the profit, whether it's offline through for us or not, so there's, it ends up being a little bit complex to dive into not just to say generally expecting to be at the kind of level you're seeing in that 2% to 3% range here over the near-term, and then we'll see after that as some of the new projects come in and others mature. Certainly construction work, as we expand that effort, could produce higher margins going forward.","Yuri J. P. Lynk - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Thanks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Was there (52:17) I didn't answer?","Operator","Mr. Lynk, did you have anything further?","Yuri J. P. Lynk - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","No. Thank you.","Operator","We'll take a question from Jeff Volshteyn with JPMorgan.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Good evening and thank you for taking my question. My first question is really on the petrochemical side of the business that's within Oil & Gas, can you help us size that within the segment and really discuss how the mix has changed in the recent quarters as far as revenues and backlog?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I mean, the three \u2013 obviously the three biggest things we've got are the big ethylene complexes and two of them are well underway on the construction side and one of them is really just starting. So those are big long projects, and so when you think about the revenue flow, really the big revenue hasn't started to flow. We're finishing PDH at Dow and we're starting with the cracker layer. CP Chem is well underway and SASOL is just kind of starting. So we've got \u2013 those are three very, very large projects that are really in the early stages of the revenue burn and obviously the profitability that goes with that.","CP Chem has been converted to lump sum, so it'll have a little bit of a back end loading in terms of profitability just because it's lump sum project. So, I think that when you look at those projects and you say that next wave that I mentioned before, that'll probably start to occur in terms of feed work next year. You can see that we've kind of got a long journey ahead of us relative to those projects and the earnings power of those over the longer term. Embedded in those projects are also some derivative programs that are there in PDHs. There's several of those kind of projects that we're pursuing, but it's a pretty robust list of petrochemicals that we're pursuing and again we're either doing the feed on some of them or are in a good pretty good position to take those projects.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","And collectively, approximately, what portion of the overall Oil & Gas segment do they represent?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'd say there's \u2013 I don't know that exactly, but I think the petrochemical side is about 20% \u2013 right around 20%.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. That's helpful. One more question on the Power side, revenues grew impressively and last quarter, there was a decline in revenues in Power. For the year in 2015, could we see growth in the Power segment and what needs to happen for that?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we're kind of in the normal \u2013 like I mentioned on the \u2013 on two of the gas fired power plants, we're really only going to the field now. So that you're in the early stages of those projects, but you'll start to see them grow over the next few quarters and clearly they're lump sum projects as well. So you'll see a little backend loading in terms of dropping profit to the bottom line on those.","Jeffrey Y. Volshteyn - JPMorgan Securities LLC","All right. Thank you very much.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Operator","At this time, we'll move to Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Just a follow-up question on outlook; in terms of buyback what was in the previous guidance versus current guidance, has anything changed?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Now we're still on \u2013 if I understand your question right, we're still on the path to complete the $1 billion share repurchase program that we announced the fourth quarter of last year. There is about $300 million left on that to be executed over the third quarter and fourth quarter.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. So it's the same as in the old outlook, correct?","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","That's correct.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I'm not sure if you'll provide more details on kind of how much of those big upstream projects in Australia and Canada contributed to your Oil & Gas P&L, but when do they rollover completely? When are they completely out of your Oil & Gas business? And I'm not sure if you'll be able to kind of provide any more color.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the big Oil & Gas stuff in Australia is out of backlog and...","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...and the stuff we're working on in Canada is all refining and upgrading stuff, so \u2013 and it's not a real significant piece of backlog, but it's not at risk.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","I was talking more from the profitability; I think, you highlighted that they contributed from \u2013 just more profitability standpoint that they're coming to completion and you had some of the kind of risk reversal and that contributed to your profitability in Oil & Gas segment, or \u2013 unless I read it incorrectly?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think you read that incorrectly. And, specifically, there is nothing in there relative to Canada or Australia that would impact that.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I'm afraid you misread that.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. And then I mean I guess lastly my question on kind of buyback versus acquisition, have you changed any sort of view on how to allocate cash? Do you have any more appetite particularly with some of the, I don't know, LNG projects not going through into your backlog, about buying kind of LNG backlog versus organically growing the business in the future?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think buying backlog is a bad business. I think that what we're going to focus on is the same sort of capital deployment strategy that we've communicated before. I think that with the markets the way they are, there probably are some opportunities that we're going to look at in terms of adding to the capabilities we've already mentioned in terms of construction, fabrication, and supply chain. So we'll be looking at some things as we go forward, but without a really good eye towards that we're going to continue to provide a robust dividend to our shareholders, and we're going to continue to buy back shares as cash is available to us \u2013 excess cash is available to us.","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Yes. So the bottom line is, no change.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our last question today will be from Robert Connors with Stifel.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys. Can you hear me?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Yeah I just wanted to touch base on, has there been any sort of update on possibly the ExxonMobil refinery coming back to the market given that refinery profits are still strong here, if you've heard anything there and then also two projects that seemed to continue to move forward, but stay below the radar a little bit are the Alaska LNG project as well as Shell's Pennsylvania cracker, just wondering what you're hearing from those?","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I prefer not to talk about those, I will say that we stay pretty close to ExxonMobil and their capital and they've got I think some robust plans ahead of them that we'll participate in, and as I've said in a previous answer I think there's a next wave of petrochemical facilities and I think we're participating in most of those as well in some form or fashion.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then I'm trying to just think on the potential buyback if it does carry forward into 2016, and one of the things that could keep you guys from buying back more stock is possibly like the working capital build particularly on the Oil & Gas side as you guys moved more to field on some of this North America work. So just wondering, Biggs, do you still expect to stay fairly working capital neutral or could we see a little bit of a build in 2016?","Biggs C. Porter - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President","Well, it's \u2013 we're not giving guidance on earnings on 2016, it's even harder to talk about timing of cash flows on work that might be won in the future, but generally speaking, we don't see any big shifts occurring in the relationship of working capital with revenue, which is what I've been saying for a few quarters, and I think, it's still true.","Robert Connors - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","And that does conclude the question-and-answer portion. At this time, I will turn things back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks.","David Thomas Seaton - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, operator, and also thank you to all the participants for being with us today. As I said, while I am pleased with what our Oil & Gas group has done from a performance standpoint, I'm disappointed in the current end market realities of the non-oil and gas markets that we serve. The challenges these groups are experiencing, especially in mining and metals as an example, is a reflection of the commodity pricing and the related capital spending in those markets.","In prior calls, we mentioned the actions that we took last year to strengthen our competitiveness, and I am really pleased with that because this include reducing our overhead, refining the business model we provide to our customers, providing a much more capital efficient solution for our customers, and strengthening our cash discipline throughout the company. We've made those changes proactively last year and I think they positioned us extremely well for future growth.","With that, I greatly appreciate your interest in our company and your confidence that you show in Fluor. So, thank you very much and good day.","Operator","And again, this concludes today's conference call. Thank you all for your participation."],"9544":["Fluor Corp.

Please go ahead, Mr. Telfer.","Geoff Telfer - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, Ashley, and welcome to Fluor's first quarter 2018 conference call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Bruce Stanski, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this afternoon after the market closed, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website, which we will reference while making prepared remarks.","But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on slide 2. During today's call and slide presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that the actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-Q filed earlier today and our Form 10-K filed on February 20.","During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now let me turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, Geoff, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us. Let's start off by discussing the challenges that we are experiencing on the same gas-fired power project we discussed last quarter and the steps we're taking to complete this project and in Fluor's participation in the specific end market.","Craft productivity and estimating were materially different than the original baseline expectations we made in the initial charge on this project last year. While those factors were included in our initial charge, the majority of the $125 million charge taken this quarter is driven by extremely low ongoing productivity and the financial impact that this has relative to the initial expected timing of when the two units would be available for power production based on the current outlook. As of last week, this project is 86% complete, with an expected completion date in Q4 of this year.","Last August we made a number of changes to our power business. This included bringing in new leadership, removing certain executives and closing our power operation office in Charlotte. I also stated that we were in the process of assessing the gas-fired market to determine if there are opportunities for risk-adjusted returns that are consistent with our expectations and long-term experience. I'd like to share with you the outcome of our review and the further actions that we are taking. I'm going to ask everyone to pay close attention.","The U.S. power consumption growth rate is less than 1%. Power producers do not really need additional capacity other than satisfying regional needs. We, the industry, and the entire E&C community have led our clients to believe that a gas-fired power project costs approximately $650 per kilowatt, although virtually no one has delivered one for that value.","The customers start at that figure, negotiate it downward and there's always some contractor that is willing to say okay to the lower number using some excuse to justify the win, Fluor included. We have had 12 gas-fired power projects since 2003. 10 of the 12 have underperformed our as-sold expectation with three suffering losses. Competition, both public and private, have had similar experiences with no current projects performing as expected.","Some industry leaders think these are cookie cutter projects, but they are not. These projects have different machines, different site locations, different labor pools, all of which produce different outcomes. Craft labor, in this case, has been the major issue. Therefore, Fluor will discontinue the pursuit of lump-sum gas-fired power market from the end of Q1.","We will finish the existing projects and fulfill our commitments. However, we are not exiting the entire power market. Our power services business, which includes maintenance, shutdowns, turnarounds and environmental upgrades are very robust and we will focus also on renewables as well as nuclear.","We will use our resources, both financial and human, to focus on other end markets to support our margin expectations. We will continue to update the investment community on this discontinued business until the last project is complete.","Now, let's review our first quarter segment highlights, which begins on slide 3. The Energy & Chemicals segment booked $721 million in new awards for the quarter and ending backlog was $14.1 billion. During the quarter, we continued to grow our self-performed construction capabilities in the Gulf Coast with the award of MEGlobal's new monoethylene glycol facility. This represents our fifth major construction project in Freeport, Texas over the last six years.","Our COOEC-Fluor yard is very active right now with pipe and steel fabrication and module assembly underway for two offshore projects and a large onshore module project. The yard achieved a major milestone in April with the first of more than 185 modules for that onshore project being loaded out. The yard recently opened new piping and painting facilities to support the workload and has more than 6,500 craft workers on site.","Our investment in this fab yard is a major part of our integrated solutions model that is now beginning to pay dividends. We continue to see indications that the energy market is turning. Last week, you saw our announcement for the LNG Canada project with our joint venture partner JGC. This project expected to reach final investment decision late this year is one of the key prospects we are tracking for 2018. Other opportunities include additional chemical derivative and refining opportunities, both domestically and international, and we see additional upstream and LNG opportunities as we move into 2019.","First quarter new awards in Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment were $1.3 billion and included a large copper mine expansion project in Peru. The ending backlog was $10.3 billion. In this segment, we continue to see some great opportunities in copper, gold and iron ore replacement projects. Infrastructure has opportunities in the United States, but my enthusiasm has tempered a bit as we wait for a long-term federal infrastructure bill.","Our application with the NRC for NuScale's continued progress, we were recently informed that the NRC completed phase one of the review process. This essentially means that the NRC has reviewed the application and provided questions on any items requiring clarification or change. NuScale and the NRC have confirmed the review is proceeding on or ahead of schedule. We expect that the passing of this milestone will attract additional investors. And last week, NuScale was selected to receive additional cost-sharing funds for SMR development from the Department of Energy.","Turning to slide 4, the Government Group posted first quarter new awards of $43 million with an ending backlog of $2.4 billion. This quarter we substantially completed our power restoration work with the Army Corps of Engineers in Puerto Rico and I'm very pleased by what we were able to accomplish in just a very few short months.","Looking at our opportunities for the balance of 2018 and we were recently informed that our work at the Savannah River Plant has been extended until July of 2019 and we are pursuing the LOGCAP V and Hanford liquid waste projects.","Diversified Services segment posted first quarter new awards of $433 million and had an ending backlog of $2.3 billion. Results for the quarter reflect growth from Stork operation in Latin America and North America. I'm pleased to see that the clients are beginning to increase their maintenance spending.","In closing, outside of my disappointment with the charges this quarter on the power project, I am encouraged by my conversations with customers and their expectation of economic growth. We remain enthusiastic about our prospects with many sizable orders in the future. And this is going to be a multi-market, multiyear upturn and we are well-positioned to meet the needs of our clients. I'm also encouraged by the performance of the projects that are taking full advantage of our integrated solutions approach as well as a growing acceptance by our clients.","Now, I'll turn it over to Bruce. Bruce?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, David, and good afternoon, everyone. Please turn to slide 5 of the presentation. I'll start by highlighting some income statement items and then move on to the balance sheet. Revenue for the quarter was $4.8 billion compared to $5 billion last quarter. Revenue improved in Government driven by Puerto Rico. It was offset slightly by declines in our other segments.","Corporate G&A expense for the first quarter was $57 million compared to $54 million last quarter. Expenses for the quarter improved when you exclude the $12 million related to foreign currency exchange losses due primarily to fluctuations in pound sterling. For the quarter, we reported a net loss attributable to Fluor of $18 million, or $0.13 per diluted share.","Results for the quarter include a $0.69 charge related to the previously mentioned gas-fired power project. $0.17 for the combined impact of foreign currency losses at the corporate level as well as for an embedded derivative related to a project with our joint venture partner in Mexico and a non-recurring hurricane-related work in Puerto Rico, which contributed $0.20.","In our last call, I noted that the paint was still drying on tax reform and that our tax rate may vary as we receive additional guidance over the course of 2018. While that is still the case, our tax rate, excluding the charge of the power project, would have been about 30% for the quarter. This higher-than-planned tax rate is a reflection of the large amount of revenue generated outside of the United States in higher tax jurisdictions and lower-than-anticipated earnings domestically.","Q1 2018 results represent the first results published under our new revenue recognition standard. Under the retrospective method that we have adopted, you can see a reconciliation of these results to the old standard in our 10-Q. For the quarter, the impact of the new standard was minimal due to timing, progress and mix for affected projects. We expect to see positive albeit much more modest impact on expected results for the remaining of the year.","Shifting to the balance sheet on slide 6, Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities for the quarter was $1.8 billion, down from $2.1 billion last quarter. The reduction in cash has been primarily in domestic cash, which reflects our need for strong cash balances to fund earnings generating businesses.","Relative to cash, a good example this quarter is the power restoration project for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in Puerto Rico. Current assets for the Government Group increased by approximately $370 million, as higher working capital needs were required to complete the project and generate the increased earnings associated with this job. Available domestic cash at quarter-end was approximately 20% of our total cash and marketable securities balance. We expect to build this balance over time to support not only future projects that have initial capital needs but also P3 infrastructure opportunities. Cash utilized by operating activities is $136 million for the quarter primarily as a result of the cash demands from Puerto Rico. During the quarter, we paid $30 million in dividends.","Moving to slide 7, new awards for the quarter were $2.5 billion and ending backlog was $29 billion. Approximately 38% of our backlog is predominantly fixed-price contracts and the mix by geography is 40% U.S. and 60% non-U.S.","Lastly, I want to point out that starting in Q1 of 2018, we have moved our Mining business into our Industrial, Infrastructure & Power segment to better align our external reporting with how these business segments are now being managed. We have posted on the Investors section of our website our Fact Book for the quarter, which includes recast segment information for the past two years under this new reporting structure.","I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2018, which is on slide 8. We are revising our 2018 earnings guidance range from $3.10 to $3.50 per diluted share to $2.10 to $2.50 per diluted share. Our guidance reflects the impact of the gas-fired power charge for the quarter, the impact of foreign exchange losses and a much more modest contribution from U.S. tax reform and the new revenue recognition standard than we expected. This guidance also assumes G&A expense of approximately $50 million per quarter, excluding any impact of foreign exchange gains or losses and a tax rate of 25% to 30%.","NuScale expenses are expected to be $75 million in 2018. Expenses were a bit higher this quarter as a result of a delay in government funding, which has now been resolved. We anticipate average margins for the remainder of 2018 in the Energy & Chemicals Group to be in the 6% to 7% range, Mining, Industrial, Infrastructure & Power, excluding NuScale, to be in the 2.5% to 3.5% range, Diversified Services to be around 4.5% to 5.5% and Government to be approximately 3% to 4%.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you And our first question is from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","Thanks. Good afternoon. I guess, one of the things that troubles me about the power project charges is the challenge that you've had in assessing the right productivity of the craft and it's troubling just because \u2013 it seems like you're moving more into the self-perform construction area where you're going to be even more reliant on forecasting that type of craft activity. So, I guess, how should investors get comfortable that taking on some of the bigger fixed-price projects with all that craft exposure is really a good investable strategy?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","That's a good question, Steve. Thank you. Look, as I understand how tragic this is, no one is more mad than I am about what's going on. But I want to point you to a couple of key points here. One is, this is one of 1,000 projects that we execute at any given time. And we execute with excellence. I mentioned the projects in Freeport being construction and we have executed with excellence in those cases. This project is challenged of where it is in the State of Florida. Being able to bring the kind of talent that we want is difficult.","I think you can also look to the fact that in that particular case, when it's a bad project, a lot of people don't want to be associated with a bad project. Where we are right now, at 86% complete, we're taking into account a much lower productivity factors. Given the schedule that we have and the needs of our customer, we feel good that we can finish it for what we took this quarter.","I'll contrast that and answer what the going forward comment is. I don't think there's an inherent risk in fixed-price construction. I think the risk is regional and associated with the approach we use for the particular project, the LNG project in Canada as an example. Our approach is different than our competition was in that we took a significant amount of labor off of that site and into our fabrication yard where it is in a controlled environment both from a productivity perspective and from a safety perspective.","So when we think about the integrated solutions, a part of that is being able to lessen the exposure to craft in certain areas and make sure that we've got an execution approach that delivers for the client and delivers the expected profit to us. I know it's hard for you guys to understand where we are on this project and the statement that this is an anomaly. We've had these projects in the past. And when a project goes bad the way this one went, it goes real bad. And while I cannot guarantee performance of future projects, I am confident that based on the fact that the projects that are exercising our new approach are performing very well and we have some very large lump-sum projects in Kuwait and other places that are performing as expected or better. Whereas this one is hard to swallow and hard for people to understand, I get that, I don't think it's a fatal flaw in our system.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","Okay. That's helpful. And then moving on to Shell, so what is your confidence that it moves forward? And can you just talk a little bit more broadly about the risk you're taking on the project? And then, I guess, broadening that out, just related to customer CapEx, I'm curious to what extent contracting structure is kind of holding back customer decisions at this point. And are you finding that customers are saying, hey, we'd go forward on that project if we could just get the EPC firm to give us a fixed-price or lump-sum contract? Is that happening?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I think there's a little bit of that happening. I think the question is whether people are putting the right numbers in there to do that. I can tell you, in our case, Jim Brittain specifically managed the development of that estimate, and I have great confidence in him and the team that pulled that together. So we are taking the risk, but we're taking it on the terms that we expect with the kind of coverage ratios that we would expect.","In the case of these power projects, I can tell you that, as I said, there's a per-kilowatt cost, and we got roped in, just like a lot of other people did, into saying that if you don't do that price, you're not going to win that project. And we're not interested in playing those games anymore. So I think when we look at Canada, it was bid on a different basis. It's bid utilizing our integrated solution approach. It's bid utilizing our yard in China. It's in a place in BC that we know how to work. The equipment that is being procured, we know how to do that, and the evidence is how well we bought the two refinery projects out in Kuwait give me great confidence that we can do this.","The business model, as I understand it, would suggest that there's a high probability of this project being funded \u2013 final FID this year. When you look at Shell's strategy around gas, when you look at the potential partners that they pulled together on this project, I have a high confidence level that FID will be achieved this year.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","And just to clarify, the craft labor productivity on this project will be your risk?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Which project?","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","LNG Canada.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yes, it will be.","Steven Fisher - UBS Investment Research","Okay. Thanks, David. Appreciate the color.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi. I guess, just a follow-up question to Steve. Understanding the industry leadership \u2013 you're being an industry leader in terms of exiting the gas-fired power business, even one of the biggest players in the industry, how do we think about being more proactive on the energy side? Because, to be fair, you took charges in power, but we've also taken charges in E&C over the past couple of years probably totaling about $300 million or so. So, what can you do as an industry leader to change the approach for contractors taking risk with the charges you've had and with some of your \u2013 with the other players in the industry on the verge of bankruptcy?","And then my second question, understanding that you're saying you have a different approach from your peers with your integrated solutions model and you will be using that on LNG Canada, have you ever delivered a project of LNG Canada's size using your integrated solutions model and why should that not be concerning to us that we're trying this on such a large project?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, it is a large project, Jamie, I agree with you. But when you look at the total value of \u2013 when you look at the two projects in Kuwait specifically, they're probably the best model of that. And in those cases, our piece is $4 billion or $5 billion. So I think, yeah, it's a bigger number. I don't think anybody's actually done it. Well, I know we haven't done a project that large using our tools and systems, but I can tell you that in the fact \u2013 let me back up. If you go back and you mentioned several projects in E&C, it's really one, and it's CPChem, and we broke that down in terms of the lessons we learned.","Now that project as well as these power projects were bid prior to the maturation of our integrated solutions approach. And there are fatal flaws in the bidding process of all of those projects. They were execution issues that weren't properly covered and you didn't have the coverage ratios you expect on a project that has the kind of risk that those projects had, part of it driven by market in terms of the power business.","But one of the things we've done is we looked at CPChem and the results and we broke it down into the issues that led to that loss. And we applied those lessons learned just in the case of E&C on the CFP project, which is the Clean Fuels Program for Kuwait. We had issues and challenges, but we're above our expected as-sold profitability there and we're nearing completion. And we use those learnings as we bid the Al-Zour plant, which was a bigger lump-sum project with partners in Kuwait.","And I can tell you that the application of those lessons learned there has even bettered our situation relative to that project. And it's not quite as far along. But we had the client in our China yard last month and saw the first module sail out. And I can tell you that the customer is pleased and I can tell you that I'm very pleased because it's meeting the schedule requirements and it's meeting the cost expectations.","Learning from that one. I mean, it's a journey that we're on, Jamie, as you can appreciate. We applied all of those to LNG Canada. And basically utilizing that modular approach, just as one case, and going back to Steve's question, we were able to take about a third of the craft expectation from a stick-built project to the module approach off of that job site. So, you look at...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I guess, I understand that and I understand that you've shifted your business model and you think this will allow you to drive greater capital efficiency for your clients and allow you to handle the project differently. But again, companies are going bankrupt because they're taking on risk. So are you changing your \u2013 or are the conversations changing with customers in that you're saying I won't do this anymore or we won't do this anymore?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I just said that, Jamie. I just said that about one segment of the power market.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I know, but I'm talking about energy.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We are having these conversations in oil and gas. We are starting to change the dialogue. Customers are continuing to try to shed risk. In a lot of cases, we're saying no. And I already see that our win rate will drop as we go through 2018 and 2019. And I'm satisfied with that drop in win rate because we're only going to win projects that meet our expected coverage ratios and the approach is utilizing the integrated solutions approach. So, yeah, the dialogue is changing.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. That's helpful. I appreciate the color. And then sorry just a follow-up question for Bruce. Bruce, the cash flow in the quarter, you talked about the working capital associated with Puerto Rico. Can you just provide some context on how much was Puerto Rico and just how broadly \u2013 how do we think about the drag on cash this quarter and how to think about cash flow for the year? And then I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Sure, Jamie. And that's why I kind of \u2013 for the first time we kind of provided on this call some guidance about U.S. domestic cash, what percentage of our total cash and marketable securities it is because that cash draw this quarter was all in \u2013 just about all in U.S. domestic cash and it was primarily all in Puerto Rico. As you can imagine, we ramped that job up very quickly and had to fund that working capital, but that money has been sent out and coming back with earnings that are recognized in the quarter for the Government Group, but the receivables and cash don't get paid. We don't get the money back until after this quarter. So that's why we think this is a timing event. We really wanted to emphasize that this need for U.S. easily accessible cash is very important to us and we're going to concentrate on continuing to build that U.S.-based cash balance.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. But is there any way to think about cash flow for the year relative to net income just as other projects \u2013 you win other projects that might have working capital needs? I'm just trying to think about cash flow for the year.","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, sure. I mean, it's the ebb and flow effect here. We time our working capital and we also keep our cash in the locales where we see our project wins to occur in the future so that we have enough cash to start up and ramp up, especially with these FIDs start to stack up on us with the customers as they pull the trigger and make the programs go forward. But as far as a working capital balance, we're going to target $2.1 billion or more on a go-forward basis.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. I appreciate it. I'll get back in queue. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Sorry, operator, we can't hear you.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon. Can you hear me? It's Andy Kaplowitz. How are you?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hi, Andy. How are you doing?","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good. So, David, well, the power project is 86% done you said. I think you have one more project in backlog in the same ilk, right? And it's probably about the same level done. Is there anything else you could do on the projects to assure investors that they can invest really for the next couple of quarters in Fluor until the projects are done? I think I remember back in the day Alan Beckman saying he was going to visit his embassy problem project every week toward the end of it. Can you do that? Shouldn't you do that? Anything more you can do?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I'm not sure I heard the last part of that, Andy. You kind of broke out just a little bit. You're talking about...","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So I just said that \u2013 yeah, back in \u2013 I think it was 2006 or something like that, I'm showing my age, but Alan Beckman had said he was going to go visit the embassy projects, his problem projects literally every week until it's done. So, as a CEO, what more can you do, David? Like, we always get the question, can I invest in Fluor till these problem projects are done. How would you answer that?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah. I mean, I've been on the project site twice this year. And I have personally directed different resources there. And I hate to even say confident, but I am in the ability of the project to complete within this number as well. And look, we used an abysmal productivity rate in setting the number that we wrote down. So I have confidence that we'll be able to finish. As you said, we're high 80s percentage. We're starting to turn over systems to the customer on Unit 1. Unit 2, I think will be an easier finish than Unit 1 has been. So I feel pretty good about the team that's there now. And yes, I'm going to be \u2013 I'm not going to say I'm going to be there every week, but I'm going to be on a routine basis and I have already taken personal review of this project.","With regard to the other one and this is a hell of it, it's the project in Virginia is going very well. It is in the same kind of completion percentage. And those guys have done a better job relative to managing that craft and making the progress that they need to make. So I feel very good about that project and what that team is doing. But yeah, I mean, when things go bad, the boss has got to be there, and I get that. And I have been and will be as we finish this project.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, David. And then, look, the power project is what it is. But if we look at the rest of the segments, in the quarter, they're at least a little below our expectations and below the guidance for the rest of the year. So, look, I don't want to read too much into one quarter, but maybe talk about the visibility for margin performance going forward. It's just hard to see \u2013 if I look at E&C, you've got a little bit of a step-up there modeled (35:05) and maintenance, I'm not sure why the margin is low there in the quarter.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well I think that, as we talked about in previous quarters, I think that we've been looking for the bottom. And I think we see it in terms of new award production. I think the second quarter might be \u2013 it'll be better, but it'll still be sub what we think it will be, and it is heavily loaded towards the backend of this year. But I think 2019 is going to be another great year. And it's on the back of refining, petrochemicals, gas, LNG. It's on copper. There's lot of work that's coming this year in the mining sector, primarily in South America, some in Australia again. So I think, as I've said in the prepared remarks, I think we're in a multi-industry multiyear upturn.","So as disappointing and as angry as I am about this particular quarter, I got to tell you I'm pretty excited about what's in front of us. And I realize the credibility hit that this takes with investors. I think we got it. And I think we're going to finish. We don't have that much time left to finish. So I believe that we've seen the bottom and as I've said, the quality of what we've put in the backlog relative to the integrated solutions is better margin with a better risk-adjusted coverage than the power projects that we've put in the backlog four years ago.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","So, just a quick clarification for Bruce. You've got a $0.30 difference between your charge and your lowered guidance. I guess, half of that or a little more than half of that is FX. Is the rest of it the difference from the $0.85 you said last quarter in rev rec plus lower tax, is that number now, call it, $0.15 lower or am I missing something?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, you're not missing anything, Andy, and actually the exact amount that we're decrementing for the range that I gave last quarter of $0.75 to $0.95 for both tax and rev rec included, we expect to be significantly lower. The time I said about two-thirds of that range would be associated with rev rec. If you look at our Q, rev rec in the quarter was only accretive to earnings by, what, little over $1 million, $1.1 million.","We expected a whole lot more than that. And again, as I said in my prepared remarks, it has to do the timing and progress and mix of all these jobs around the world and how rev rec is calculated. The total that we have and you could see that in our retained earnings, about the $360 million, which last quarter we thought that's what the total impact would be over 3.5 or 4 years. We still believe that number is correct. It's the timing of it. And that's why we are being much more prudent here on what's actually going to come in this year.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, guys.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you","Operator","And our next question is from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Yes. Hi, good evening.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hi, Jerry.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","David, can you talk about where you see the mining award cycle in terms of expansions versus greenfield and when do you expect to see meaningful pickup in terms of the greenfield portion of the book there? Obviously, we've had mid-sized project so far by Fluor standards based on like a pipeline. When do you think we could see more meaningful greenfields booked for you folks?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I think it's going to be a while before you see greenfield. What we're seeing right now is kind of replacement type projects and they're big projects. I mean, there's two or three projects that are in the near term that are in excess of $1 billion in copper, iron ore and to a lesser degree gold. But in terms of really ramping up capacity, I don't see that for a while. I don't think we're there yet. But in this cycle, I think you're going to see a lot of upgrades, a lot of replacement capacity, going deeper or harder to process ores, which is right up our alleyway and there's some very large projects that we're pursuing. But I wouldn't even venture a guess as to when you're going to see the real large $10 billion kind of new capacity mines and processing facilities coming on. But I think we've got a long tail on the stuff we've just talked about over the next \u2013 in terms of new award, so probably the next two to two-and-a-half years.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And, David, how does the cadence of new awards look in terms of what you would expect to be awarded this year versus what the 2019 or maybe 2020 event? How would you characterize the cadence of that activity?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I guess, I'd use the word steady. I think over the next six to eight quarters, you're going to see something pretty good size within that mining sector. We've really done a lot of work leading up to this cycle on frontends and studies and stayed very close to these customers and help them develop these projects. So, I think that team's done an outstanding job of really looking at which projects that we want to go get, where we have a differentiated offering. And I think over the next, like I said, six to eight quarters, you're going to see a pretty steady new award flow.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And David, on LNG Canada, are you willing to talk about based on your plan what proportion of the man hours or total fabrication work will be done at your fabrication facilities versus onsite and how that's different from a similar scope LNG projects in the past. Can you frame that for us at all?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","No. I really I want to get into segmenting that. I would just say that our yard is going to be busy for quite some time.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","And we hear modular project approaches from a lot of your competitors as well. Can you just frame for us on a project of this size how is your approach using fabrication yard to modularize and effectively drive less craft labor onsite, how that's different from the approaches that some others are using just to help us all build comfort with the fixed-price risk there?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I think lots of people are talking about modularization because we are. Other companies have done it in the past and have that expertise. But I would use Kuwait as an example. There's lots of people fabricating pipe racks. We're fabricating fleet process modules fully loaded with pipe, instrumentation, electrical, lighting, everything, which goes back to Redwater in Canada.","But it all starts with the design approach that we've taken, which is different than our competition. It deals with how these modules are separated, it has with the weight of these modules. But the most important thing is how do you load that module sufficient to where you gain the productivity on the job site once those modules appear.","Our experience in both CFP and the \u2013 Suncor and the other projects that we've done \u2013 setup has been flawless, which again goes back to that design approach, the design procedures that we've implemented. So I think that we do have a little bit different mousetrap than anyone else and that's been proven. And we're way down the road on the two biggest ones that we've done so far, which is the two Kuwait projects. And seeing what's actually stacked in these modules on Al-Zour shows a significant difference in terms of what our competition is trying to accomplish.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I appreciate the color. Thank you.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","And our next question is from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. David, you talked about being fairly selective going forward might impact your win rate, but can you talk about maybe the areas that do carry \u2013 is there commonality (44:40) in terms of the risk you're more selective around in terms of maybe the types of projects or the regions?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","No, I wouldn't segment that, Tahira. I think, as I've said, we started on this journey when I became CEO. And I think where we are in that journey is perfecting the approach and we've been able to prove it. And if that is correct and I believe it is, I believe that it kind of gives us the latitude to choose the right projects for that approach. Say thank you, but no thank you to the ones that don't. And I don't think market or region necessarily have a bearing on that. And we're not going to be the low bidder, but we're going to have the best solution in some cases. And that should give everyone comfort that we're actually doing the \u2013 we're looking at things differently today than we looked at when we bid those four power plants.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, okay. And David, you mentioned renewables, nuclear I get, and it seems NuScale has come through against all I think, media hype or skepticism and it's doing really well. But would love to get a better sense of what you're thinking on the renewable side?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I mean, solar and wind are going to be part of it. We're not going to obviously take the kind of approach as I'm suggesting in E&C with those kinds of things. But we've got an expertise there and we're going to continue to do the projects when they come up. We follow that and particularly the solar side very carefully and technologies are changing. It's becoming more amenable to the models that they need to do.","But, I think, the bigger issue is the power generators and where do they need the power. And I think that really translates into opportunity for NuScale because it's not going to be in the places where you think. It's going to be in places where there's a new industrial capability going in. So I think internationally there's a big market there. In the U.S., it's going to be in places like Idaho where project number one will be. But I'm very encouraged by what we've been able to accomplish there.","As you said, there are a lot of naysayers. We submitted our design certification on time \u2013 first one ever. It was docketed ahead of schedule terms, ahead of any technologies that have been in front of the NRC in their lifetime. We've hit all the schedules and passed phase one with flying colors. The client base is growing. The DoE sees the value of nuclear power and specifically the small module reactor and the flexibility that that gives for not only government institutions but also, as I said, some of these industrial complexes around the globe. I'm really, really satisfied with what they've been able to accomplish.","Now, we got to keep after it and get the NRC approval done. But I think from a technical perspective, it's proven its worth. And now we get into the legal reviews and all the licensing kinds of things that go on. So I feel pretty bullish about where we are in terms of bringing in new investors and those projects moving forward in the timeframe we've communicated previously.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it, okay. And, David, just to follow up to that, when you look at renewables or maybe matter of fact, re-look (48:55) even outside on your overarching business, do you think or do you see anything that technology-wise or process-wise that could be as potentially disruptive as NuScale? As we look at renewables as well, it's more the traditional opportunities that you see out there.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, if governments completely walk away from lowering greenhouse gas, that would be something that would be a problem. And clearly when you burn gas, you have emissions. Nuclear, you do not. And I think people are starting to realize that. But I think the issues that I see that could be disruptors are more geopolitical issues because some of these places for us to be able to participate the country that it's going to needs a 123 Agreement or we won't be able to deploy that technology there.","The Saudis don't have one yet, but they're working on it. I've had conversations with the folks in Saudi as well as within the DoE and they're moving in the right direction for that. So it's those kind of things that I think are really the disruptors that I'm concerned about.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. Thank you, David.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, Tahira.","Operator","And our next question comes from Michael Dudas with Vertical Research.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Good afternoon, everybody. David, as you look at the bid list over the next four to eight quarters, how much of that is involved with the integrated solutions that you guys have? Every now (50:44) project has that support towards it. And what about the current projects that are still in the backlog? Are they scrubbed to the point where it's using these technologies and systems that you've created or is there still some from (50:58) the \"legacy issues\" that might not achieve on a profit or productivity scale?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Michael. Couple of comments. Number one, when you have an issue like we've had, you can bet that we turned everything upside down throughout the company on that 1,000 projects that I mentioned. But I'd point you back to that 1,000 projects that I mentioned. We had four power projects that were bid by the same management team at the same time and we and we accepted. We being me and my management team accepted those bids primarily because we just come off of a project in that market where we had bettered the as-sold margin expectation.","Different things happened. We ended up with a problem, but it's a confined problem within a group. And I acknowledge the question by Jamie on E&C and specifically the CPChem project again bid before we exercise this. So I believe when we look at the risk in the backlog based on our reviews, based on where we are on finishing projects that are questionable without the benefit of the integrated solutions, I think we're in a good place.","With regard to the integrated solution, not every customer, not every project is going to enjoy the full implementation and we're okay with that. But when that lack of implementation of the full model is driven by a customer, there needs to be a very serious question about where the risk resides.","And going back to again Jamie's question, we're already having those conversations. And in some cases, either we or the customer because they won't accept what we want to do have parted ways and I'm okay with that too because what our customers have asked us to do is to become more capital efficient and more sure in terms of cost and schedule. We've invested over the last five years significantly in our tools and systems. And in this model, which includes fabrication, direct (53:28) our construction, our supply chain capabilities. When we're able to deploy those, I think we're going to be in a very good place. And where we're not, there will be a risk-adjusted approach to that.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Understood. And to follow up, David, on your comments regarding Government and Infrastructure, handicap how you think with LOGCAP and some of the other opportunities you see throughout the year help Fluor's position. And is infrastructure just solely Congress not going to get back together and allowing the funding for the larger type projects that you guys would rather be involved in or is the PPP projects or are they just not quite ready to get let out in the timeframe that you'd need to see, say, this (54:13) year into next?","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","On infrastructure, I think it's a timing thing, Mike. You look at the gestation period of some of these things and I think I've told this group a couple of calls back about how long it took to get the Denver Eagle project from basically proof of process to cutting a ribbon and taking a decade.","I would argue that the LA People Mover is no different than that. The Purple Line is no different than that. You saw that even though it was sanctioned and moved forward, the government intervened again, but they were pushing more the regulatory side of that equation as opposed to the PPP model or where that financial model set.","So, yes, disappointed that Congress can't get their act together. I get it. Tax reform was a big deal. You read the papers like I do and the vitriol that's going on in that place. So getting them to an infrastructure bill that starts this process is problematic. But when I look at what we're chasing and where those projects are in that gestation period, I think we're going to see a steady \u2013 kind of a steady award cadence over the next three years. I hope it's going to accelerate. I think it will accelerate. But I think it's as much the regulatory situation as it is a comprehensive infrastructure bill by Congress.","I'm sorry what was the first part?","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Government.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Government.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","(56:02).","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Feel good about where we are. I mean, I think that that team has done an outstanding job of growing that business. When you look at the number of DoE sites we've added over the last three years, I think we have a good brand in that market and are continuing to bid those projects and being successful.","If you're not doing a good job, they don't extend you which is evidenced by the Savannah River Plant extending us for a year to get them ready for the rebid, which I feel good that we'll be successful in that rebid. On the DoD side, I think we've proven to the Army that we're a contractor of choice and we provide the best value. And I think we'll continue to win in that business. It's a good solid annuity style business, as we've said in the past, and I feel really good about where the brand sits with those customers.","Michael S. Dudas - Vertical Research Partners LLC","Thank you, David.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Mike.","Operator","And our next question comes from Andy Wittmann with Baird.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my questions. Maybe Bruce or David, this one's for you, I guess. On NuScale, I guess, the Q said that the funding was going to run out here earlier in this quarter. But you said on the call earlier that it had been extended, maybe just clarifying that. And can you just talk about how long it's been extended or the dollar amount of the matching funds that you've been able to realize with this extension?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Sure. And then this is the ongoing process of kind of renewing the government matching funds that they're providing for the development of this technology and they are very fiscal-year driven \u2013 government fiscal-year driven so that end of that year is September 30. And we were notified that the application we did, we got the award back for their next tranche of funding, which is in the tune of about $40 million that will be coming to us as soon as we get that agreement penned with them. The usage of that money flows through this year and we already are applying for additional funds for next year.","It's kind of a knock-on effect relative to burning the funds up on its current agreement while you're applying for the next one to keep the development of technology going through. So, that's why I said, in the quarter, we're a little overspend, if you kind of \u2013 four quarter or $75 million spend, it would look like we're going to overspend, but that will clearly normalize before the end of the year and we will not be spending more than $75 million on NuScale, but be progressing the technology as we intended.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","And I think it also ought to be said that the administration as well as the Secretary of Energy have seen small module reactors and nuclear in general in a positive light. So I think we're in a better position to continue to secure the matching funds as we go through time.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's helpful. And then just on Puerto Rico, given that it's kind of episodic in the numbers, can you talk about just quantifying that so we can get a better sense about what the revenue underlying the Government segment might be running at?","Bruce A. Stanski - Fluor Corp.","Well, certainly that type of business which we call contingency type of business and, of course, you know Andy, I have a little bit of experience in the Government Group here, these are areas where we are well-positioned and postured to fill immediate needs of the government and the people it supports and protects, and Puerto Rico was just perfect example of that. But pretty much no different than any other kind of a contingency event, whether it be in Afghanistan or any other portions of the world, some of them get sustained a lot longer.","So the underlying business of that we see a good solid business, as David said, but those type of areas are where we can build upon this Department of Energy base, what we do for them, decontaminating, decommissioning nuclear facilities, supporting their nuclear operations, running their strategic petroleum reserve, these episodic type of events or contingency events are kind of the icing on the cake there because we're able to really demonstrate how we pull from all aspects of Fluor to fix a problem that's facing our nation or national security.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Operator","That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Seaton, at this time, I will turn the conference back over to you for any additional or closing remarks.","David T. Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, operator. Despite a disastrous quarter and our disappointment, I'm really excited about the future. No one is more disappointed than I am relative to where we are on a very finite sample of projects and we do know where the end is and we believe we've captured that. But I think, again, we're in a multiyear, multi-industry growth mode and in the past you've seen Fluor outperform our competition and grow significantly. And I think we're poised to do so and I think the new approaches that we're applying give us better visibility into how those executions are going to be performed.","I appreciate your interest in our company and I wish you a good day.","Operator","This concludes today's call.

A question-and-answer session will follow management's presentation.","","At this time, for opening remarks, I would like to turn the call over to Geoff Telfer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, Mr. Telfer.","Geoff Telfer - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, Noah, and welcome to Fluor's fourth quarter 2016 conference call. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer. Our earnings announcement was released this morning before market open, and we have posted a slide presentation on our website which we'll reference while making prepared remarks.","But before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our Safe Harbor note regarding forward-looking statements which is summarized on slide two. During today's call and slide presentation, we'll be making forward-looking statements which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. However, there is an inherent risk that the actual results could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-K, which was filed earlier today.","During today's call, we may also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in our earnings release and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now, let me turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Geoff. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us here today. On today's call, we'll review our fourth quarter and full year 2016 results as well as discuss the outlook for 2017.","But before we move to the numbers, I want to recap some of the more notable events in 2016. I think, we've had quite a year notwithstanding our issue with CPChem. But in January, we saw the mobilization of more than 6,000 craft staff employees to support the construction activities of the two Westinghouse nuclear projects. One in Georgia, one is South Carolina, both of which support our direct hire construction strategy.","In February, we saw the first of number of awards in our infrastructure business line with the award of Loop 202 South Mountain Freeway Project in Phoenix, Arizona. In March, we continued to build on our integrated solutions platform completing the acquisition of Stork and our investment in the fabrication facilities in Zhuhai, China with our partner COOEC.","Also in March, we completed our first ever euro-dominated bond offering of \u20ac500 million with an interest rate of 1.75%. This low rate was due in part to our A minus credit rating. We received another infrastructure award in April. This time the Port Access Road Project in Charleston South Carolina, proving that we can be competitive in the smaller infrastructure fixed price opportunities that will exist as we go forward.","In May, we saw the completion of the large Cerro Verde mining project in Peru with excellent performance. We received another infrastructure award in June. This time it was the Purple Line Light Rail Project in Maryland. The final investment decision for the Tengizchevroil project in Kazakhstan was reached in July. The TCO project was our largest single contract award for 2016.","In August, the Department of Energy extended our contract for site management and operations of facility Savannah River in South Carolina. And in the following month, we received major multi-year remediation contracts to operate depleted uranium hexafluoride conversion facilities in Paducah, Kentucky and Piketon, Ohio.","Infrastructure was again in the news in October with the reward of the reconstruction of the A27 and A1 motorways in the Netherlands. In December, we saw the completion of all eight 419-foot towers on the Tappan Zee Bridge in New York State. This was a significant milestone for the infrastructure group and our project team. We also saw an award for construction of a new production facility for Novo Nordisk in North Carolina. This facility is the largest in Novo Nordisk's history and will produce life-saving medicines for use by patients around the world.","And finally, NuScale submitted their on-time application to the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission for approval of the company's small modular reactor design. This is the first ever SMR design certification application to be submitted to the NRC and marks a significant milestone for NuScale and the power generation industry.","Now let me go to 2016 and I'd like to begin with slide 3. 2016 earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were $281 million or $2 per diluted share. Excluding the previously announced non-cash adverse tax effects of $45 million or $0.32 per diluted share, we reported a net profit from continuing operations of $326 million or $2.32 per diluted share. This compares to $418 million and $2.85 per diluted share a year ago.","Consolidated segment profit for 2016 was $744 million compared to $1 billion a year ago. Segment profits for 2016 were 3.9% compared to 5.7% last year. Excluding the negative impact of the charges taken in Q2 into Q3 on our fixed-price contract for CPChem, segment profit margin for the year would have been approximately 5.2%. Consolidated 2016 revenues was $19 billion, up from $18.1 billion a year ago.","Full year new awards were $21 billion, including $8.4 billion in Energy, Chemicals & Mining; $6.2 billion in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power; $4.6 billion in Government; and $1.8 billion in our Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment. Consolidated backlog at year-end was $45 billion, flat from the $44.7 billion reported a year ago.","If you'll turn to slide 4, the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment booked a $1 billion new award for the quarter including a bauxite development project in Guinea. Ending backlog for Energy, Chemical & Mining segment was $21.8 billion compared to $29.4 billion in 2015.","Looking ahead, we have read the same things you have when it comes to what the oil majors and their capital spending plans will be. I believe that the relative stability in the oil price that we've seen over the last 12 months has given our customers the confidence to move forward with higher return projects as evidenced by their indication that capital spending in certain areas could be higher in 2017.","Fourth quarter new awards in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power were $1.3 billion including the Novo Nordisk pharmaceutical manufacturing facility I previously mentioned. We closed the year with a backlog in IIP of $15.1 billion compared to $9.7 billion at the end of 2015, again reflecting the growth across all end markets we serve.","I'm particularly pleased with our infrastructure business, as they've been able to double infrastructure backlog over the course of the year. There's been quite a bit of focus and excitement around infrastructure related opportunity since the election. 2016 was a great year for us from an infrastructure standpoint and we will start to see more bid decisions in 2017, somewhat based on the FAST Act funding agreement passed over a year ago. Any spending initiatives from the Trump administration will be well received and we have given our input as how best to speed up the approval and funding process for those new projects.","Turning to slide 5, the Government group posted fourth quarter new awards of $101 million and ending backlog in 2016 was $5.2 billion compared with $3.6 billion at the end of 2015.","The Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity segment posted fourth quarter new awards of $357 million. Ending backlog in 2016 was $2.9 billion compared to $2.1 billion at the end of 2015.","Looking back, 2015 and 2016 represent one of the most difficult times in our industry. In fact, Energy and Chemical awards during this two-year period were the lowest they've been since 2009-2010. Even with that headwind, we were able to grow our backlog and focus our resources on non-commodity markets and opportunities. So what does that mean for 2017? I think it means that our Energy and Chemicals pipeline of opportunities will be coming off the bottom of the cycle. Clients focused on higher return projects and capital efficiency match well with what our talents provide.","We also see reason to be optimistic not only in mining, which is also coming off of the bottom of their cycle, but also infrastructure where it appears \u2013 the interest and motivation to expand spending both domestically and abroad.","With that, now I'll turn it over to Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and the corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to slide 6 of the presentation. I'll start by providing some additional comments on our fourth quarter performance, then move to the balance sheet.","Revenue for the quarter was $5 billion, up from $4.4 billion a year ago. Revenue gains from Industrial, Infrastructure & Power; Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity; and Government were offset by decline in the Energy, Chemicals & Mining segment.","Corporate G&A expense for the fourth quarter was $56 million compared to $54 million a year ago. Restructuring expenses in the quarter were partially offset by foreign exchange gains. As we stated in our preannouncement last week, taxes in the fourth quarter include $45 million in noncash tax effects related primarily to new IRS regulations that were issued in December. We don't expect this regulation to have a recurring effect. The other significant tax effect had to do with foreign subsidiary losses driven by organizational realignment activities. A majority of this tax effect was related to Stork. Both of these effects are noncash in nature. Our tax estimate of 33% to 35% remains unchanged for 2017.","Shifting to the balance sheet, Fluor's cash plus current and noncurrent marketable securities totaled $2.1 billion compared to $2.1 billion last quarter and $2.4 billion a year ago. In 2016, the company generated $706 million in cash flow from operating activities compared to $849 million in 2015. The company also returned $118 million in cash to shareholders through dividends.","Moving to slide 7, Fluor's consolidated backlog at quarter end was $45 billion. The percentage of fixed-price contracts in our overall backlog declined to 27%. At quarter end, the mix by geography was 52% U.S. and 48% non-U.S.","This is the first time U.S.-based backlog has been above 50% since 2008. I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2017 which is on slide 8. We're maintaining our guidance for 2017 of $2.75 to $3.25 per diluted share. Our range for 2017 assumes continued challenges in our commodity-focused segment, offset by increasing opportunities in Infrastructure, Industrial and Government.","Our guidance for 2017 also assumes G&A expense in the range of $180 million to $200 million and a tax rate of 33% to 35%. Other expectations for 2017 include a modest decline in NuScale expenses to approximately $80 million, and capital expenditures of approximately $200 million to $275 million depending upon AMECO opportunities. Our guidance reflects an expectation of gradual quarterly improvement in 2016 (sic) [2017] (14:14).","We anticipate average full-year margins in Energy, Chemicals & Mining group to be in the 4% to 5% range; Industrial, Infrastructure & Power excluding NuScale to be in the 4% to 4.5% range; Maintenance, Modification & Asset Integrity to be around 4.5% to 5.5%; and Government to be approximately 3%.","With that, operator, we're ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And, we'll take our first question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hi. Good morning, everyone.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good morning.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","You had a nice backlog increase in II&P this quarter looks like maybe a scope adjustment. Can you talk about the drivers?","And, separately, can you talk about any discussions you've had on the nuclear projects with VAN customers Southern and SCANA considering the concerns about Westinghouse? Is there a contingency scenario planning that you folks are part of where you get an opportunity to continue to work maybe with increased scope going forward?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well the adjustment is primarily Westinghouse. But let me talk about Westinghouse a little bit here. Obviously, they are in a challenged position. We were brought in a year ago, a little over a year ago to try to help Westinghouse construct these facilities and I think we've been able to help them see where they are and where the issues are and we're moving forward.","In both cases, we have great long standing relationships with both Southern and with SCANA and Santee Cooper and I personally have relationships with the managements of both those companies. And we're going to do what we can to finish these projects. Clearly, Westinghouse or at least Toshiba has made the comment that they plan to finish these projects and we expect to be there to help them do so.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And David as part of the backlog adjustment, have you updated the timeframe of when the projects are expected to be completed? I think the latest estimates were in 2020, but I think subject to revision, did that change with the backlog increase this quarter?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","That new schedule is part of our review and the estimate to complete based on that schedule.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. And then separately, can you just say more about the bookings environment in EC&M over the course of 2017? Do you think you can maintain or maybe possibly grow backlog over the course of the year? Can you just touch on what type of end markets do you expect to drive your booking activity over the next 12 months?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I'm actually pretty excited about what's in front of us. If we think about what we chase on factored and on unfactored basis, in the EC&M segment, we're chasing about 50% more this year than we did in 2016. And I would say 2015's probably about the same number, which is somewhat backend loaded.","Some of these projects aren't to be actually sanctioned and awarded until second half of the year. But I think as my prepared remarks suggest, we think we're at the absolute bottom of the cycle and what we see is an improving slate of things to chase. And we're not changing our selectivity sieve at all from a quality of project perspective, but we're seeing that what I predicted two years ago, and that is, there'll be pent-up demand on things because customers have kind of delayed projects for their own financial reasons, but now reached to the point where they've got to spend again.","So, I think we're kind of in the beginning stages of what I would argue would be a sustained positive capital cycle that we've seen in the past. And I believe we're positioned as good as anybody to win better than our fair share of those projects. So, I kind of think, and that's both oil and gas and in mining. You saw the two awards last year in bauxite. We're seeing a movement in copper. You've seen the copper prices increase. We're highly successful in Cerro Verde, which leads to hopefully other projects that that customer as well as the others going to do. So, we're growing from such a low basis in mining, I think we're in for some really good awards in that particular piece of EC&M. But then on the oil, gas and chemical side, we see some chemicals work, we see some more refining work. We're bidding some significantly large projects in refining and we're also starting to see some of those upstream projects loosen up, TCO being the latest example of that.","Jerry Revich - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thank you very much.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, good morning.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Morning.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hi, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I guess my first question, well one, congrats on beating ex the tax noise. But just the one question I do have, I guess I appreciate the color that you guys are providing on guidance now. But I was a little surprised by the margins that you guys are guiding to for EC&M. So, can you talk about the drivers to sort of to get to the low end? I don't know if it's CPChem at zero margin or TCO ramping or mining. I guess that level just sort of surprised me to some degree, so I guess if you could start-off with that.","And then, David, I guess my second question, you sound a lot more optimistic on sort of the award potential, I would say relative to how you sounded last quarter. So, my question is do you think given \u2013 do you think your customers \u2013 or do you think we'll see any success with your new business model and that you could win your fair share of awards just given your vertically integrated approach and the cost that you can take out of the projects relative to the competition. And sort of how you're going to balance the potential awards with what you talked about last quarter in terms of, just you talked about just the competitive environment really seem to take a turn for the worse? Thanks.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, the quick answer is, you answered your question. It's lots of moving parts in terms of the margin equation. It's just a change in mix, it's everything associated with that grouping of businesses. And Biggs, can give some color on second half. I'll answer your second question.","It's always competitive. This is something that I'm not sure it gets enough press. It doesn't matter if times are good or times are bad. It's a dog fight in this industry. I mean, we have to be competitive. We have to be able to present the best solution for our customers. So, I would argue that I've never seen an easy competitive time in my career, right?","So, with that as a backstop though, when you look at the integrated solutions option that we have, it follows exactly what the customers have asked us for, in terms of better certainty of cost and schedule and better capital efficiency. And I think we're proving that time in and time out.","So I think that the proof is, is that the customers are starting to say, well, nobody else has the ability to do the entire lifecycle cost slate of a capital program. And I know some of our competition would disagree with that, but our customers are proving that we're correct. So, I think that I am a little more optimistic as I look at new awards in 2017 and 2018. But I'm cautiously optimistic in terms of how that translates into earnings in 2017. But I think that...","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","But I guess, because you sounded like a lot of the awards get hit towards the latter part of the year and I guess my concerns always been \u2013 I mean given what you're seeing, do you think 2017's the trough for earnings or 2018? I mean if the awards start of inflect, it probably doesn't matter but I'm just trying to think about your confidence level...","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","We've already given you the guidance, Jamie. We're not going to (24:06) for 2018.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I'm asking for 2018.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I think that \u2013 look, we're coming off of what would have been a really good year had it not been for one project. If you take that out, it would have been a really good year in the face of what was probably the worst economic times our industry has seen in a while. So it shows the power of Fluor in the earnings that, that we have available to us. We have worked off a significant amount of the engineering piece of that particular market and we're starting to rebuild it. So you're going to see and you're going to see earnings in 2017 fairly flat with 2016 because of the timing of the cycle.","But again, you've got to think about us in terms of the diversity we provide. In the face of probably the worst two years of new award performance in E&C, as I said in the prepared remarks in a half a decade, we were able to marginally grow backlog because of the diversity that we provide. So when we look at the earnings curves on infrastructure, those are really backend loaded kinds of programs and projects. So, earnings in the near-term are going to be fairly flat, as I said. But when we start looking at 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, I think we're on an increasing scale in terms of profitability.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Back to the margin question, Jamie, on the CPChem, yes, when you have a project that you've booked a loss on, going forward you effectively book it at zero, so, that does have a little bit of depressing effect on margin rate, but you should think of that as being in the range of 20 basis points. So, it's not a dramatic swinger in terms of what's happening to the margin rates.","The big driver is, as David said, is the change in mix. We've been talking about it for a couple of quarters saying it was coming in terms of shifting from much more engineering content to much more intensive construction and procurement content. Segment the contracts between engineering and construction and procurement, you get this mix shift because engineering is just a much higher margin rate than construction is as it goes through the books.","So, what you're looking at in 2017 is just the burn-off of the engineering on the projects that we got new awards in ECM over the last few years, and transitioning more fully to construction on those projects which should have had enough inflow of new engineering work to sustain the mix for now. Obviously, as David commented, as we go forward, we get new awards in, we'll see a shift back. So, it's really mix.","If you look at the last few quarters, if you normalize them for the CPChem charge, by example, then you would see that over time we actually seen a shift downward in the margins on ECM reflecting this gradual move and it's just going to continue into next year until we get some new engineering work in.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Thank you. That's helpful.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thanks, Jamie.","Jamie L. Cook - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","I'll get back in queue.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thanks. Good morning.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good morning.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","On the Westinghouse nuclear work, can you just tell us how often you're getting paid on that work and how that's changed over the course of the past year that you've been doing the work? I thought in the beginning the expectation was you would get paid every 30 days but just kind of curious if that's still the case and how that's changed.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We've got a little bit of a delay in terms of payment, but I wouldn't call it material. Right now, if you think about \u2013 you've read the same things I've read on Toshiba's announcement and the things that they're having to go through. We have enough conversations with them to feel that they're in a place where the banks are going to help them fund these projects and we expect those ARs to be fully paid. But it's a timing element, but the accounts receivable issue is not material.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. And then just a question on the sensitivity of customer project investment decisions and costs and just kind of get to the question about what is really still holding projects back and I'm wondering if it's cost or confidence or what have you. But I guess if you could take costs out by another 10%, how many projects do you think that would move forward in this environment or is it not that simple? And if it were just a matter of taking 10% out, how would you do that? Or is it 20% that needs to come out? It's sort of a big picture question about what still needs to happen to get projects moving forward.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I think that we've already proven that we can take significant percent of the cost out, assuming that the customer is flexible enough to let that change happen. I would argue that in a lot of cases, customers are still under the mode of, that's not the way we do it here. And where the C-suite of the customer say yes, yes, yes, that's what we want is the integrated approach, what we're doing, taking money out, changing the execution's approach. But when it gets into their organization, sometimes the organization vetoes the CEO, which is a dangerous place to be if you're looking for capital efficiency.","In terms of going forward, I mean, as I said, just in E&C alone we see a 50% rise in what we're looking at during 2017 over 2016. So those projects are moving forward, but as we've said in the past, they move forward at their own pace. And even though the customers are a little more eager to get some of these things done, they're still going through what I would argue is a more detailed gating process than they've gone through maybe in that last boom. And I think prudently so, because I think there were some projects that our oil & gas friends would have probably avoided had they not believed that $100 oil was there forever. So I think it's just a matter of good, prudent gating processes. But as I said, we're seeing an increase in activity. We're seeing an increase in the number of bids that we're focused on. Just in EC&M alone in 2017, there is around 775 prospects that we're chasing in that alone.","So that's up again, that's up as well, not the same 50%, because my 50% is on dollar value. But we're winning our fair share. And I think that that will continue, but just with the one word of caution and is I think it's probably a second half of 2017 before we see some of those significant projects actually get to sanctioning.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. So it's not just more costs need to come out of this broader...","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I mean costs maybe...","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","...gating opportunity.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Costs continually need to come out. Make no mistake. And what we're delivering is a lower cost solution. And I think that's evidenced by some of the awards we've had across the board not just in EC&M but also in EC&M.","Steven Michael Fisher - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Thanks a lot.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Kaplowitz with Citi.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Good morning, guys.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good morning.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","David or Biggs, revenue in EC&M actually beat our estimate by quite a bit and had a nice sequential uptick. Was it just older projects moving from engineering to construction as you've been talking about or did you see any uptick in revenue burn in your project portfolio as customers have started to feel comfortable with the commodity environment? If that's the case, could revenue burn continue to pick up in 2017?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","So I think the answer to your questions are yes, in general, it is largely a shift from engineering to construction procurement, which has higher revenue, lower margin, but higher revenue that has caused the uptick in, and that may continue into, at least for a while in 2017. So, that's what I think is going on from a revenue standpoint. In terms of, I think, your question was what is the offset...","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","No, Biggs. It's like did you see any older projects that had been sort of slow burn because customers are burdened (34:05) down with the uncertainty...","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Just by going into construction the burn rate's going to go up because you're at a later part of the project. The revenues go up with the construction activities going up, and so that's going to increase the burn rate. So, overall, our burn rate as a company has gone up.","If you look at what's in the 10-K, it says that the burn rate on 2016 backlog is going to be 42% for 2017, which is up from last year. It's up in EC&M, but it's down some in Industrial, Infrastructure & Power because projects like the Purple Line, which is large, very long life, and Westinghouse also large and long life. So, you've got EC&M burn rate going up based upon the maturity of those projects, but then in other parts of the business, partially offset by large, long life projects being added in.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Okay. That's helpful, Biggs. And, David, maybe just your perspective, you've been talking about mining on this call. If you remember, I think in 2012, it was about 40% of your total backlog. It was very large. Obviously, we've seen a snapback in bookings. You talked about the overall funnel improving. But do you think it's possible over the next year, I mean I think you bottomed-out at something like $1 billion of mining backlog. Do you think it's possible to do several billion dollars of mining awards over the next year? Is that how we should be thinking, is that a possibility?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, we bottomed-out at $0.5 billion, that's how low it got.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","I rounded out for you.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, thank you. But I mean, I think it's one of these things that we maybe not get enough credit for, as when you think about it, it was 40% of our backlog three years ago, four years ago, and it was $0.5 billion at the beginning of last year. And we're still one of the biggest dogs on the block. I think, it shows that we can skate to where the puck's going to be to steal from the great Gretzky.","But I do believe that there are some projects out there in mining that will be awarded, that will continue to build the backlog of mining in 2017. But I also believe that we're on the beginning of a little longer new award train. The issue is going to be \u2013 I don't think it's going to be as big as it was in that last cycle, primarily driven by just global growth.","And we'll see what happens, but you're starting to see copper pricing improve, you're starting to see some of the other commodity pricing improved on a more sustained basis. So you've got some of these companies that are kind of downsized, and looked at what their base business is going to be going forward from a commodity perspective. And I think they're starting to get ready to start spending again. And again, there's very few players in that particular segment that can do these very large projects, and we're obviously one of the key companies that these mining groups come to.","Andrew Kaplowitz - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks, David.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good morning, folks.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Hi, Tahira.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Good morning.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. So, first of all, congratulations on the NRC submissions. They are pretty big milestone for the industry. David, I guess a couple of questions around that. Number one, do you have to wait till the receipt of the submission to maybe have people really take notice and maybe for some talks around partnership to materialize further? And secondly, how should we look at people just approaching the nuclear industry including SMRs given all the cost increases on these news project sales?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, first off, congratulations to your husband for the National Championship. I'm sure you're probably pleased with that as well.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","He is happy.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","As well as my wife. I'm sorry?","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. And he's very happy, as you can imagine.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Yeah, go Tigers. Just kills me to say that. But so to your question, we submitted on time. The official acceptance of that was about a week later in January. The NRC basically has 60 days to do what basically the review enough to docket that particular submission.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","We expect, based on all the conversations and reviews and questions and the answers to those questions that we went through over the last year and a half, we expect to be docketed with around the 60-day period, which will be sometime mid next month.","And that begins the formal review. And I think, that's a significant milestone. And one, that shows that, this is a real technology, one that will be taken seriously by the NRC, and their review hopefully give us that good housekeeping seal of approval.","On the competitiveness perspective, I think, that that there is fewer companies around the globe that can afford the major nukes. There may be countries that can that are willing to sign-up for some of these programs. And I would argue that even the Westinghouse AP1000 has a place in the future and the costs associated with it will not be as dire as they've been on basically the first kind of generation. I mean the first ones are being completed in China. And then you obviously, have the two here in the United States.","But I think the larger market is with the SMR, particularly because it's a smaller program and project. You're not looking at the same megawatts, as you are with some of those bigger units. So I think, the applicability of the small modular reactor is much more broad and has different applications.","It's not just a power generating source for the power generators. It's a captive power source for large industrial uses. It's a technology that does not have the same containment vessel requirements because of its design. It does not have some of the safety concerns that maybe some of the older technologies have in terms of the cooling system. So, I think there is a different application for the SMR that will continue to grow. And I believe once it's docketed, it obviously proves to the industry that it's real, and I think that will attract additional investors in NuScale.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","I'd just also add that because it's manufactured, there's much greater cost certainty associated with it.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Right, right.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. Okay. And I guess second question David, we might be headed back in a more inflationary environment. How should I think about that? What do you worry about on the cost side for your company?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I would have thought that some of the pressures would have already started to creep up in terms of cost of commodities, cost of engineered equipment items and the like. But we're in a middle of a couple of significant mid-cycles and we haven't seen any dramatic increase or expectation of increase in terms of the bid validity from some of these vendors. In lot of cases, when you start to see inflationary pressures, you'll start to see the bid validity on some of these things shorten. And we have not seen that phenomenon yet in the marketplace.","And even with the little bit of inflation, I don't think it really dramatically changes my view on the things that we're chasing. It may have a bit of additional cost but, again, we're taking cost out and the net-net is, it's still going to be a cheaper cost per unit of production than they've seen in the past cycles.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","But you also have to remember, we're a very international company.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Right.","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","So, it's not about inflation in the United States it's about what's going on globally. And we revisit our total costs globally and we will continue to do so. So, I think that from a economic standpoint, the effects of inflation is one part of it, global economy versus another (43:30) will be muted on us.","Tahira Afzal - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, folks.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Good morning, guys. So, I just wanted to clarify, kind of your guidance outlook, and maybe my math is off. But I'm just kind of looking at margins. They're similar year-over-year. So I think you mentioned about step up in burn rate, but then also in oil and gas business, but also kind of full burn rate in the Industrial & Power business. Kind of look, how they'd get to those to the $3 EPS next year, that's what I'm a little bit struggling with. What kind of burn rate do we need to see next year to get to that $3 EPS, given flat margins?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Well, as I said, the burn rate against backlog is about 42%. So that tells you what's flowing into next year out of what we already have. And then one of the key variabilities for any year is the pace of new awards and what the mix of those is as it comes in. And obviously that's a more subjective estimate as to both win rates and the timing of those new awards. But you get a good feel for at least what's coming out of backlog. But what is coming out of backlog, as I said, is on the Energy, Chemicals & Mining side is a lower burn rate. But with that is some growth in revenue that's occurred. Does that sustain itself all the way through 2017 at a higher overall revenue rate for ECM? Well, quite possibly, but we don't go so far as to literally guide on revenue, but it's just the natural flow of things.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, is it fair to say that it assumes kind of assumption of additional new work next year, so inflection maybe in some of the backlog and that's what's helping to get to that $3 EPS target?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Well, I mean, if you normalize this year, I mean, you think about it in terms of actually, would expect somebody to kind of go the opposite direction with inflection because if you take our 2016 results and normalize those for CPChem and for tax, then that we've talked about just in the last couple of quarters, you'd be up around $3.42 for this year. So, really what we're saying is that the net mix effects are going to take us back down. ECM is going to have a lower margin, so that's a downward for us. But there's growth in the other businesses which are going to take it back up and partially offset that and as a result of all that, puts us at around that $3 per share range.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay. I'll just take it offline. And just maybe you can talk in general about just key government policies that you think will impact your business besides kind of the obvious infrastructure investment. I don't know if you could, in particular, touch on any impact from the cross-border adjustment. I know you have a fabrication facility in Mexico. How meaningful is it to your cost savings for some of the U.S. facilities? Any impact from any deregulation to DP (46:50)? Just generally speaking, what should we be thinking about and watching?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I mean, I think that we're a global company and we'll be able to deal with any of the issues that are there. I was on a panel \u2013 and I think this speaks to part of what you're getting at. I was on a panel back in October, it was before the election. And a question from the audience was, under which presidential candidate would business be more successful under. And my answer was simply it doesn't matter. Business will do what business needs to do to perform given any of the regulatory issues, changes that are there. Border tax may have some impact on our customers, very little on us. We have the ability to fabricate in a lot of different places. With our work right now being 52%, I think it is, U.S. based business, it would have very little impact in terms of the short-term.","And just the global reach that we have and how we execute work, we're able to kind of put the project together in the most effective and efficient manner. And you look at the KNPC projects right now, we're not doing any engineering in the United States for those projects and we're procuring very little out of the United States. And in the case of some of the U.S. based projects, there's stuff obviously being brought in, commodity items and the like, but very few of them are actually manufactured in the States. So that would \u2013 in the case of the border tax would obtain a waiver.","So I mean, I don't think there's really any policy issues that are in front of us that really have an impact on our business in the short-term. I will say I'm encouraged. I mean, the President is basically doing what the President said he was going to do in terms of addressing some of the competitive issues and constraints that have been placed on the United States, whether that's tax policy, whether that's being America first. I mean, I think they're all positive steps, and certainly they all fit within our ability to perform.","Anna Kaminskaya - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Great. Thank you so much.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Wittmann with Robert W. Baird & Company.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Great. Thanks. I appreciate the opportunity here.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","How you doing?","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","David, in the past you've talked about the lineup for U.S. crackers, the second wave. I've seen a little bit of movement in some of the headlines on a couple of these projects. I'd just like to get your view on if you think that some of these can hit in a more material fashion into your backlog this year and if you believe that you're positioned to capture some of them.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","I think there's significant petrochemical and chemical opportunities that could hit the backlog this year. I'm not sure one of them will be a cracker. But we're still tracking those and looking at how we compete for those. There may be one that gets close this year but again, I think it's all backend loaded. You saw where one of the major programs on methanol was the decision was delayed, which we're competing for. But again, it's not that it's cancelled, it's just delayed in the decision process, where again, I go back to something I said earlier, customers are being a little more thoughtful in terms of the gating process and whether they have all the T's crossed and the I's dotted before they sanction these projects. So I think it's a market that we're focused on, but again, I think it's a backend kind of award in 2017.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. And then just checking in on CPChem, obviously, no charge this quarter and I think everyone's obviously happy to see that. I guess, now that you've got kind of your feet back under you it appears, do you feel like the cost estimates that you have in place and the way the project is going has you set up for no further charges as you stand here today?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I can't say no other charges. But I will say that steady as she goes. Peter Oosterveer is actually on-site today and we are performing in line with what our expectation was.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay. That's fair enough. And then maybe just my final question would just be in the Government segment. This has been over the last couple of quarters very steady. Can you just talk about what contracts you have coming up for rebid and what the potential opportunities to add new contracts to your Government business are shaping up to be for 2017?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, there's a fair amount of opportunity on the DOD side that will start \u2013 it will be additive to what we already have. Afghanistan is staying basically flat year-over-year. On the DOE side, we were beginning the recompete process at Savannah River. We feel pretty good about that because of the performance that we're providing the DOE there. Same thing, the performance as I said at Piketon and Paducah is proving us to be one of the DOE's go-to contractors. So that's going to provide a lot of opportunity going forward.","But again, I mean, you've heard me say this before, I love the Government business because it's a good, steady, long-term contract base that pays the light bills so that we can go and build stuff other places around the globe. But I will say that if you look at our Government business today versus maybe a decade ago, it's much more sustainable, it's much more solid in terms of long-term contracts. It's much more solid in terms of its impact on our company. And I'm really pleased with what those guys have been able to accomplish.","Andrew John Wittmann - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you very much.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you.","Operator","We'll take our next question from Yuri Lynk with Canaccord Genuity.","Yuri Jonathan Peter Lynk - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Hey, good morning, guys.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good morning.","Yuri Jonathan Peter Lynk - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","David, just to drill in on the infrastructure side, a little more color on \u2013 you're pretty positive on that market. Is that more due to the changes you've made internally repositioning that business or has the macro just continued to get a little bit better more accommodative? And any color on the regions where you're seeing the activity?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","It is a great question. I'd say some of it is what we've done internally in terms of the structure of that group, but also in terms of that integrated solution and some of the power of Fluor's buying ability. If you think about it, we buy more commodity items and equipment on an annual basis than ExxonMobil or Chevron on any given year. So with that comes significant buying power. But also we've improved our capability in that market and brought some new people in to where we're seeing great success. So, I'm really pleased with the development of that group and the leadership there and what they're providing to the overall corporation.","And then I think the other piece of that and you're right, it's the market. I mean there is a pent up demand for infrastructure. And we see significant growth in that market. But I think the growth that we see is pinned on the fact that we've improved our offering and improved our ability to perform on those projects.","I can't overemphasize the importance of things like the Charleston port project, which proved to us we could be competitive on that $200 million to $500 million kind of project because I think in the United States that's where the market's going to be. Many of these large programs will take a decade to develop. That's why I made the comment in the press and been vocal with the government that there is no such thing as a shovel-ready project on those big, big programs.","It'd take a long time to on the gestation period and then they take a fair amount of time to build. I mean I think the Denver Light Rail's a great example where it took 10 years from basically the first funding to cutting the ribbon.","So I think that's part of it. But it's not just roads and bridges, I mean it's ports, it's airports, it's the inland waterways, the locks and dams. It's pipelines, it's power distribution from the generation that all needs to be upgraded and that's just in the United States. Then you look at outside the United States, we're looking at growing in Western Europe. We've been particularly successful in the Netherlands and in Germany. We're looking in places like Australia, and other places where Fluor has a huge footprint, to make sure that we've got the people and the capabilities to actually execute these projects. So, even with the growth and opportunity, we're not getting out over our skis in terms of what we can actually perform. So, again, I'm pretty bullish on the infrastructure, continuing to be a significant piece of our offering.","Yuri Jonathan Peter Lynk - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","That's great. Thanks, David. And I'll just squeeze in a last one, maybe for Biggs. Biggs, just a housekeeping issue, non-controlling interest dropped quite a bit in the fourth quarter from kind of the mid-teens run rate. Any color on how that's going to shake out for the full year 2017?","Biggs C. Porter - Fluor Corp.","Well, I think it's just, I mean, it's just another flavor of mix through the businesses, non-controlling interest just relates to those projects that we do through JV that we consolidate through JV. We have lots of JVs we don't consolidate, more than we actually consolidate. So, it being a relatively small part of the business, there just wasn't that much income on those consolidated JVs in the fourth quarter. But I would expect that 2017 for the non-controlling interest number to be back more what it has been for this last year in the aggregate, if not up some.","Yuri Jonathan Peter Lynk - Canaccord Genuity Corp.","Helpful. Thanks, guys.","Operator","We'll take our final question today from Chad Dillard with Deutsche Bank.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Good morning.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Good morning, Chad.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, last quarter you'd mentioned that you are seeing some pricing pressure in oil and gas and called it a spillover affect in a few other segments, and as a result, you were kind of dialing back your bidding activity. But it seems like from your comments today that you're looking to increase that activity.","So I just wanted to understand, I mean would it be fair to say that you're actually seeing an improvement in pricing and that's causing you to actually go back into the market? Just trying to understand what the competitive environment looks like now.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, we never dialed back our bidding. So if that's what you heard then we mis-communicated. We've not changed our bidding cycle because of pricing at all. What we're seeing is more opportunity our there than it was there maybe this time last year. So we're still looking at the same slate of projects with the same characteristics, the same risk profile that we've had in the past. I just think that the market has changed.","And just a final comment on inflation or pricing pressures that are there. Everybody has the same pricing pressures. And your customers are dealing with them. They're pressuring us as an industry. We just had to be more competitive. And a lot of the things that we've done internally is, you've heard me say this before, sticking to your knitting and dealing with the things that we can control. Better engineering tools and the way we design things to improve the overall efficiency and cost of the facility.","Once we get into EPC, we've focused dramatically on supply chain and I think we've proven over time that we can take \u2013 we're much better at negotiating better prices from our vendors and we're much better delivering that savings on to the project and to ultimately the customer, which in turn makes us more competitive. The focus on direct-hire construction has helped us mitigate risk, but also improved the profit streams that come in to our company. So the strategy that we set out four-and-a-half, five years ago is beginning to pay dividends. And I think that from a competitive perspective, we're in a better position than anybody else I know of to deliver what the customers are asking for, which is that cost and schedule certainty and efficiency in terms of the capital spend. So I think we're in a good position and I wouldn't say that I'm more bullish, much more bullish than I was in previous times, I just think there's more opportunities for us to chase right now.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","That's helpful. And then just I've got a question on your MMAI business. We're seeing a pretty steady drawdown in backlog there. And I'm just trying to understand the drivers. And so, just to what extent is this weakness being driven by more like the legacy Fluor business versus historic? And then also like what sort of visibility you have in that business? I mean, since this stability in energy prices, have you seen any uptick in bidding in there?","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Well, I think, the impact you're seeing is the same impact you've seen on capital projects. Meaning, we're heavily in the oil and gas business in terms of the MMAI business and what you're seeing is customers stopped spending and delayed some of these turnarounds, delayed some of the maintenance changes that they wanted to make. So, that's really what led to the decrease as opposed to legacy businesses because it was kind of across the board.","But again, I see the same phenomenon there to where they've delayed some of these turnarounds, and major maintenance programs to the point where they can't delay it anymore without having some sort of issue that in terms of production or God forbid, some catastrophic event. So, we're starting to see those types of things get back on schedule, and we should see I think, some increase in improvement in 2017 in that segment.","Chad Dillard - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to management for any additional or closing remarks.","David Thomas Seaton - Fluor Corp.","Thank you, Noah. And, thanks to all of you for participating on the call today. As I mentioned earlier, there is no question that the last few years had been a challenge from a growth perspective. With minimum economic growth, and low commodity prices, our customers reduced capital spending and maintenance spending, as expected, in our commodity-based businesses. While our diverse portfolio serves us well, we were able to grow non-ECM backlog. It's not just enough unfortunately to overcome the downturn in EC&M.","Fluor has not been idle during this downturn. We made significant investments to improve our integrated solutions offering. And in fact, we're not as I said for the charge related to CPChem it would have been one of our better years. We've made the internal investments to improve our project delivery that leads to the capital efficiencies that our customers expect.","We have been relentless in controlling our overhead cost and my hats off to the organization for what is a very difficult process to go through as many of you know. But as we come out of this market trough and enter the new growth cycle, I think Fluor emerges as a stronger and more competitive company and are ready to capture more than our fair share of the market that's available to us.","While we expect most of our growth to come organically, we will continue to seek strategic opportunities that add to that integrated solutions portfolio.","And, with that we, again, greatly appreciate your support of Fluor and we wish you a good day. Thank you.","Operator","And that does conclude today's conference.

Please go ahead, Mr. Telfer.","Geoff Telfer","Thank you, operator. Welcome to Fluor's fourth quarter and 2014 year-end conference call. Today represented here from Amsterdam, where we're here for the opening our new office in the Netherlands. With us today are David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Biggs Porter, Fluor's Chief Financial Officer.","Our earnings announcement was released this morning before the market opened. We have posted a slide presentation at our website, which we will reference while making prepared remarks.","Before getting started, I'd like to refer you to our safe harbor note regarding forward-looking statements, which is summarized on Slide 2.","During today's call and slide presentation, we will be making forward-looking statements, which reflect our current analysis of existing trends and information. There is an inherent risk that actual results and experience could differ materially. You can find a discussion of our risk factors, which could potentially contribute to such differences in the company's Form 10-K, which was filed earlier today.","During this call, we may discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these amounts with the comparable GAAP measures are reflected in the earnings release and are posted in the Investor Relations section at our website at investor.fluor.com.","Now I'll turn the call over to David Seaton, Fluor's Chairman and CEO. David?","David Seaton","Thanks, Geoff. Good morning, everyone, and I appreciated you joining us today. On today\u2019s call, we\u2019ll review our fourth quarter and full-year 2014 results and discuss our outlook for 2015. But before we move to next slide, I\u2019d like to make some introductory remarks.","2014 was an important year for Fluor relative to our growth, as well as our competitiveness. Throughout \u201914, we continued on a deliberant purposeful path to improve client\u2019s services, staying into their needs and improved capital efficiency with greater assurance relative to cost of schedule certainty on the major projects that we\u2019re doing for them.","Our customers are focused on capital efficiency, that selecting continued, so they can continue to invest and we\u2019re helping them do that. We\u2019ve been on a three year past strength in our competitiveness and create profitable growth for our shareholders. At the same time, we\u2019ve also positioned our businesses to provide clients with integrated solutions competitively offering them the breath of our knowledge capabilities and service.","As a result, we believe we\u2019re in a better position to day to compete and win new work regardless of the market condition. The pipeline of projects is not diminished. Back in June of last year, I mentioned that we had pipeline of Oil & Gas projects totaling some $50 billion. Even though we\u2019ve booked a number of those in the second half of 2014, a pipeline the prospects today is still roughly the same size.","Since June, we\u2019ve had success in booking the Fort Hills project in Canada, Sasol Cracker in the Gulf Coast, Pemex Tula Coker, the RAPID project in Malaysia for Petronas and last week NEXUS pipeline.","To summarize, 10 billion projects of the original list were awarded to us, 2 billion was lost or canceled and 10 billion of new prospects have been added. With that we feel confident that are opportunities that remains in very good shape. The exact timing of the awards however, is one uncertain and we\u2019ve to use the term lump before and that will not change. The lumps may occur over a longer period of time this time which makes a longer more sustain cycle not the end of a cycle.","In our mind, there is too much use of the word headwinds. Headwinds is seen in the marketplace so far effects the part of the old patch on which we do not depend.","More importantly, there is still tailwind - sorry - more importantly, there is still a tailwind for longer term growth is just blowing a bit softer and will cause a time over which the spending occurs to extend. Low cost gas is still a positive driver and there are customer decisions that are effected by all they see current pricing in temporary. Although there will be some delays in some cases, customers will ultimately make the decision based on those long term expectations.","So with that, let\u2019s look at the 2014 full-year results beginning with Slide 3. Net earnings attributable to Fluor from continuing operations were strong at $715 million or $4.48 per diluted share which compares with $668 million or $4.06 per diluted share a year ago. Consolidated profit for 2014 rose to $1.3 billion from $1.2 billion a year ago.","The growth in segment profit, I think reflects growth as expected in Oil & Gas and Power, which was offset by declines in Industrial & Infrastructure, Government and our Global Services segments. Segment profits were 5.9% which compares to 4.4% a year ago. Oil & Gas margins improved to 5.9% up from 3.8% a year ago.","Consolidated 2014 revenues was $21.5 billion, down from $27.4 billion a year ago, mainly due to significantly lower revenues in the mining and metals business segment.","Full year new awards were record $28.8 billion including $19.7 billion in Oil & Gas, $4.7 billion in Government, $3.3 in Industrial & Infrastructure and $1.1 in Power. Consolidated backlog at year end was $42.5 billion, up 22% from $34.9 billion a year ago.","If you would, please turn to Slide 4. The Oil & Gas segment booked 4.9 in awards as I said including the projects that I spoke off earlier in this call, the Sasol Chemicals, the Ethane Crackers and the Gulf Coast, the Pemex Tula Refinery Coker project and with that any backlog for the Oil & Gas segment was 41% from a year ago and 1.9% sequentially to end 2014 and a record $28.4.","Fourth quarter new awards in Industrial & Infrastructure were $712 million including the A9 Holendrecht, Diemen road project in the Netherlands. Any backlog for the Industrial & Infrastructure decline is as we continue to work off mining and metals projects. We closed the year with backlog of $7.3 billion compared with $10.5 billion at the end of a year ago.","Turning to Slide 5; the Government group posted fourth quarter new awards of $157 million ending backlog for that segment of 2014 was $4.7 billion. In the Power segment, fourth quarter new award were $528 million including a five year contract extension to perform maintenance at the Diablo Canyon nuclear plant in California. Ending backlog for Power in 2014 was a $2.1 billion, up slightly from a year ago.","With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over Biggs to review some of the details of our operating performance and corporate financial metrics for the quarter. Biggs?","Biggs Porter","Thanks, David, and good morning, everyone. Please turn to Slide 6 of the presentation. I\u2019ll start by providing some addition comments on our fourth quarter performance then move to the balance sheet.","Revenue for the quarter was $5.5 billion which compares to $6.3 billion a year ago. As expected, overall revenue for the quarter was down fairly significantly year-over-year, mainly due to the continued reduction and mining activity along with upstream coal bed methane gas project in Australia which is completed.","EPS from continued operations for the fourth quarter was $1.41 compared to $1.1 a year ago. This quarter\u2019s EPS includes the benefit of lower effective tax rate at 23%, primarily due to the favorable resolution of tax audit issues as well as lower share count as a result of our share repurchase program.","Turning to Slide 7; corporate G&A expenses for the fourth quarter were $53 million, down from $65 million a year ago. The decrease was mainly the result of lower stock price driven compensation costs.","Shifting to the balance sheet; Fluor\u2019s financial condition remains very strong with cash plus non-current marketable securities totaling $2.4 billion, this compares to $2.7 billion a year ago. In 2014, the company generated $643 million in cash from operating activities and returned over $1 billion in cash to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends.","In November, the Board of Directors authorized an increase in existing share repurchase program but 10 million shares. We issued $500 million of debt and repurchased approximately $500 million of share in the fourth quarter. The company plans to repurchase another $500 million of shares over the course of 2015.","Moving to Slide 8; Fluor\u2019s consolidated backlog at year-end was $42.5 billion. The percentage of fixed price contracts in our overall backlog was 19% at quarter end and a mix by geography was 34% U.S. and 66% non-U.S.","I will conclude my remarks by commenting on our guidance for 2015, which is on Slide 9. As stated in our release, although we continued to closely monitor the capital spending plans of our major Oil & Gas clients, at this point in time, we believe the effects from slower sipping by our customers on our earnings per share guidance will be significantly offset by the positive effects of our share repurchase program. However we believe the upper half of the range will still achievable has become more challenging.","We are accordingly expanding the 2015 guidance range slightly to $4.40 to $5 per diluted share. This guidance is closely effects the previously announced termination settlement of Flour GS to find benefit pension plan later in 2015.","Our guidance for 2015 also assumes G&A expense for the range of $190 to $200 million, a tax rate of 33% to 35% and capital expenditures of approximately $300 million. We don\u2019t give a quarterly guidance, by looking at the first quarter 2015 versus the fourth quarter 2014, I think there are few things people to keep in mind.","This include the tax benefit we recorded in the fourth quarter from the resolution of audit issues and the benefit to compensation expense of the mark-to-market of our share based compensation. I would now surely characterize these as unusual because they\u2019ve happened before and there are other things were similar positive or negative effect may happen again. But having said that, these are dot items we expect to occur every quarter.","We expect this year\u2019s first quarter to look more or like last year\u2019s first year with EPS building throughout the year.","With that operator, we\u2019re ready to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we\u2019ll take our first question from Andrew Kaplowitz with Barclays. Your line is now open.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Hey, good morning, guys.","David Seaton","Hi Andy.","Andrew Kaplowitz","David, how should we think about your backlog going forward, you mentioned bumpiness and I think incentives from our side is that Oil & Gas could have some pressure here on the backlog going forward. Can you maintain your overall backlog? And then how much risk is there to project currently in backlog. I know you guys probably noted over the Pemex, the ways that they take about over the weekend. So we often get that question sort of quality of the back on, maybe you can talk about that?","David Seaton","Yeah, I think when you look at as the current backlog, we feel pretty good about what\u2019s in there, you know lot of the things that have been announced, they are pushed a little bit to the right, really the majority of that\u2019s not in our backlog at this moment. I think as overtime, we\u2019ve been - we\u2019ve been very conservative in what we take in and how confident we are in that going forward. So I don\u2019t really see a lot of risk in our current backlog from a cancelation or a delay perspective.","However, when you look at what is not in our backlog but we anticipated to be in our backlog, as we get into the first half of the year, some of it has been push to the right. So maintaining the record backlog and improving upon that in \u201915, we don\u2019t have as good feel for that. But again that really does an impact \u201915, it more impact \u201916 and \u201917 when you think about the burn of some of these projects.","As I said in my opening remarks, I\u2019ve been in front of a lot of customers over the last couple of week, particularly in the Oil & Gas business. And for the types of things that we\u2019re chasing, they feel pretty bullish about them going forward. It\u2019s just a matter of win. I think they\u2019ve got their challenges with their investor based that they are dealing with and they are taking one more look in a deep breath before they start pulling the trigger on some of these programs. But I\u2019d also say that\u2019s okay, we feel good about the fact that we\u2019ve taken the efforts over the last three years to become much more competitive and in fact we\u2019re already showing customer that we can help them become more capital efficient in terms of how they spend.","So I think that over the last three years, we\u2019ve done all the things we need to do to be very, very competitive in a market. It\u2019s like, like it is right now with volatility or not.","Andrew Kaplowitz","Got it. So I wanted to ask you in that context David about Oil & Gas revenue, I mean I\u2019ll let Jimmy ask you the margin question on Q4. But like when we look at the evaluation of Oil & Gas revenue and I mean it was pretty low in the quarter obviously very high margin. I guess we\u2019re concerned a bit about a slow burn here, go through a lot of the dreams your company is and so why wouldn\u2019t slow burn be an issue for your guys to, you know as we look at \u201915, is that maybe a reason why you kind of standard the range and talk about getting bit the high end? Is that the biggest reason?","David Seaton","Well I mean I think, I\u2019ll go back to what I said about backlog, we feel pretty good about what\u2019s in backlog but in terms of E&C, we\u2019re at the beginning stages, there is some very, very large projects where you are in the design phase, you are early in the procurement phase and you are not anyway close to be in a field and construction. So it\u2019s kind of deft from a revenue burn perspective based on the timing of some of these projects not because of some delay or fear of delay.","Biggs Porter","And Andy on the high end, we didn\u2019t get rid of it, we said could be more challenging but as a nuance but we didn\u2019t take if off the table.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Robert Connors with Stifel. Your line is now open.","Robert Connors","Hey, good morning, guys.","David Seaton","Good morning, Rob.","Robert Connors","I was just wondering for - to get a little bit of a color on the flavor of the 10 billion of prospects that did start to come into your feed list in the back half to sort of canceled out the 10 billion that you would want by upstream versus downstream as well as geography?","David Seaton","Well I think it\u2019s pretty clear that there is not a whole lot of upstream in terms of exploration and production but I\u2019ll remind you again that we\u2019re really not exposed to most of the E&P side of the equation. But when you look mid-stream pipelines, when you look at refinery in petrochemicals, all of those are seeing new prospects. I\u2019d say that regionally we\u2019re still a lot in the United States but there is also work in Canada, Middle East as well as Asia. These are part of that in billion that\u2019s come in.","I think the interesting thing is that because of the efforts that we took around competitiveness it\u2019s actually open the bigger window for us and we feel confident in being able to go after some projects with some really good customers that maybe has a different contractual approach. But again I\u2019ll remind you what Biggs says, our backlog right now is 19% fixed price. So even moving that up into the low 20s, it doesn\u2019t take us back to the max that we\u2019ve seen in years gone by of 50%. So we\u2019re being very measure and very conservative and cautious. But I think the actions that we\u2019ve taken have actually opened the more of opportunity for us globally.","Robert Connors","And then, Dave I guess, stepping back one of my bigger questions is, since you took over, you need for a liner, flatter sort of organization, one of the benefits we saw as that one mining rolled over, you were able to roll a lot of that capacity into the Oil & Gas side. So just going forward, if we are in a sustain sort of swell our Oil & Gas CapEx spending environment, I am just wondering if we could see possibly some - a material shortages downside just on the Oil & Gas because now oil and gas and mining are sort of firing in all cylinders?","David Seaton","You know that\u2019s a great question. I think what we\u2019ve done over the last couple of years is really protected the dispersed execution model. And what that means is we\u2019ve been able to right size the - we\u2019ve right sized each of the offices and are able to more the work around. So I think from a standpoint of a work force, we\u2019ve got a much more stable work force today and going forward. So I don\u2019t see a lot of headwinds to use the terms, we don\u2019t like to use, less tailwind relative to population that we have. But what this is also allowed us to do is this two self-change and we\u2019re ready to grow, I mean we really have the ability to turn those levels now and not have any issues relative to a big piece of the talent that we need access to.","We still have the challenge on the craft side from a skill side perspective. We\u2019re working on that now. So we\u2019ve had the ability in this and a little bit of a slowdown to kind of do a little bit of a check and see where do we need to spend the training efforts and it allows us to focus on the craft side. So I feel really good about where we stand from a human recourse perspective and the ability to turn that crank very quickly when things improve.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jamie Cook with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","Ben Shaw","Hi good morning. This is actually Den Shaw on for Jamie.","David Seaton","Hi Ben.","Ben Shaw","Andy sent me out for this one, just wanted to talk about the oil and gas margins in the quarter 7.3%. I guess you talk about that a bit and it looks like there might have some favorable closeouts there and also how should we think about that going forward, just given the uncertainty in the market and as projects ramped constrictions?","David Seaton","Den, I think - go ahead, sorry.","Ben Shaw","I mean do you think you can hold kind of the 5% margin in 2015?","Biggs Porter","2014, yeah I think we can hold 5% margin. I think I go back and make two comments; one is the comment around the timing of where we are in the individual projects where the type revenue we\u2019re burning is more services based. There really weren\u2019t any closeouts during the quarter that push that up, but I would also say that in the changes that we have made in the organization, we clearly become more profitable in terms of the returns that we are expecting from these project.","So I feel pretty comfortable in say that margin should start with the 5 going for quite sometimes within oil and gas.","David Seaton","I think for next year, may start out the fire range but there are certain the potential for go up into the 6 range as well and then they are pulling up in that territory for the year.","Ben Shaw","Okay, got it, that\u2019s helpful. And then I get some into your other businesses, looks like order in Power and I&I were pretty solid, can you talk about the ability for you to grow backlog in those two segments throughout the year? And then I\u2019ll be back.","David Seaton","Well I think Power has become, if you can believe it more competitive. There is a lot of people they don\u2019t have the diversity that we have that are forced to make some in my opinion some poor decisions on they expect and what they will accept. I do believe we\u2019re in a good position to grow backlog in Power over the short term and I feel good about our position regardless of the fuel\u2019s chose. When you look at the outlook been able to resign that agreement in nuclear space, when you look at some of the shutdown turnaround that we do, gas is obviously driving the ship.","So I feel pretty good about growth backlog in Power but I just caution that there is some really heavy competitive pressure there. When you look at the industrial market, we\u2019re seeing some pretty significant new opportunities in terms of the life sciences piece of that business. We\u2019re also seeing the manufacturing side where the fair amount of new capital expenditures they were looking at. And again and that [ph] segment is pretty global in nature. In the Power segment, it\u2019s primarily North America but obviously that gives us the rest of the world to kind of leverage in utilizing this first execution model that I spoke earlier.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Tahira Afzal with KeyBanc. Your line is now open.","Tahira Afzal","Thank you. Folks, congratulations on the good quarter.","David Seaton","Thank you, Tahira.","Tahira Afzal","And the first question is, we\u2019ve seen you in press release something that NEXUS, you know when we track all the major pipeline projects in North America and outside of keystone, Dallas is up to more than a 100-200 - 150 billion potentially that is supposed to be awarded within the next couple of years. So I some of you might see some timing issues in your more traditional Oil & Gas market, do you see the opportunities on the pipeline side as then being a meaningful offset especially into second half and 2016 timeframe.","David Seaton","Absolutely, absolutely, we saw that coming years ago and actually Peter and his team when he was running E&C put together a small group to focus exclusive on the major pipelines. The keystone pipeline is so politicized, we had like elsewhere, but your numbers are same numbers that we look at and I think there is great opportunity in terms of pipeline replacement programs as well as the new think like NEXUS. And I think we\u2019ve formed some really good relationships with our customers in terms of how we\u2019re execute those things and again look for that capital efficiency where we can find it. So it\u2019s a - I think it\u2019s a good growth story as we go through the next two or three years.","Tahira Afzal","Got it. And second question is on really market share gains for yourselves, you know from what I hear at tradeshows, you remained very discipline in bidding and a lot of your recent gains have really come from being able to market cost savings for your clients. As you go into an environment which is tougher, does that net-net provide more opportunities for you from market share gain or is disciplined bidding going to keep it around flattish?","David Seaton","I think there is great opportunity. As I said, I mean I think we kind of changed the game relative to how - we develop these projects with our customers and really look at how do you change the traditional approach with our customers to make sure that we\u2019re getting best back for the buck. I think there is over the years, some maybe some bad is going to into these capital program where they are really happy when their facility operates at a 120% a nameplate capacity when basically all they wanted was a 100% of nameplate capacity. And I think that\u2019s something that our customers are looking at and say we just can\u2019t afford that and luckily we\u2019re head of the game, we\u2019re away ahead of the game in terms of being able to demonstrate how to lower those capital cost to our customer.","So regardless of the competitive situation, we feel like we\u2019re in the best position to give them the best asset as a best price and at the same time maintain the profitability that we expect. So I think we\u2019ve kind of changed the game here and I think that\u2019s going to board well for us for many, many years to come.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Jerry Revich with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Jerry Revich","Hi good morning.","David Seaton","Good morning, Jerry.","Jerry Revich","I am wondering if you gentlemen can just talk about out of the $50 billion pipeline, can you give us just a rough flavor how the regional breakout compares to your current backlog and maybe touch on how big give a prospect lists in refining specifically?","David Seaton","You know I think it\u2019s pretty much all the globe to very honest with. I would say that in the near term and still heavily weighted towards North America, but the opportunity set is very global. I mean three or four countries in South America, three of four countries in the Middle East, China the non-sanctioned piece of Russia, the South East Asia, I mean there is just a lot of work out there that\u2019s pending.","I would say it\u2019s heavier on the petrochemical side right now than anything else, but it\u2019s not vastly bigger than bigger than the refining opportunities or frankly some of the upstream opportunities are still make the cut relative to the decision need to be taken.","And again lot of these project are getting bigger, so the gestation period is longer which kind of speak to that lumpiness that we mentioned earlier. But as we go over the next 12 quarters, I feel pretty good about solid growth in that market place over that longer period of time. And that\u2019s Oil & Gas.","When you look at Infrastructure, there is growth opportunities there. I mentioned Power and the life sciences side of our business. There is opportunities in our Government outside of the U.S. Federal Government. So I think we still have a pretty good growth story. I just think we\u2019ve got a temporary cooling based on one - well two commodity prices copper and the barrel of oil. But I\u2019d remind the audience here that it was only four-five years ago that our oil company customers are making the same capital decisions on $50 oil. So that\u2019s not that long ago and I\u2019d remind everyone that people suggest that this scow is going to fall everyone above $100 a barrel.","So you got to look at the stuff in long term and I frankly thing that in terms of our business and in terms of the Oil & Gas companies business, it\u2019s a good time, it\u2019s a buying time if you will in terms of capturing those projects that matter and I think our client relationships and our performance prove that we\u2019re in the best shape to capture that.","Jerry Revich","And David, a couple of years ago at the Analyst Day you spoke about building a skill set in LNG and obviously your venture you to see has gone pretty well for your folks. What are the strategic priorities for you during this cool off period any other technology skill of I guess areas that we should look for you folks to build out or any other strategic combinations of relationships I mean consolidation that would make sense for your folks?","David Seaton","Well I think it\u2019s in a couple of areas, it\u2019s not as specific as LNG, but we\u2019re going to continue to focus on our supply chain capabilities in terms of how we buy, where we buy, the development of new suppliers and all of logistics to go, I mean lot of these programs now are as much about logistics as they are about the technical capabilities of the engineering piece. We\u2019re going to continue to grow direct our construction and our fabrication capabilities to service the customers where we need that help. Again craft labor a pinch point we\u2019re making sure we\u2019ve got the capacity to get if off the sight into a fair beyond where you\u2019ve got controlled environment which I believe increases the quality and surety of delivery.","So I feel pretty good about doing that. I guess the other comment that I would make is this really in the cooking off period, this is an opportunity to kind of look at the future and grow from there. So the glass - listen just an opinion, I mean the glass is half full, it is not half empty as most people are boarding.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Alex Rygiel with FBR Capital Markets. Your line is now open.","Alex Rygiel","Thank you. Good morning. Nice quarter, Dave.","David Seaton","Hi Alex, how are you?","Alex Rygiel","Not bad. A couple of quick questions, first in the I&I segment, that segment has started obviously stabilizes first the mining cycle. Do you think margins have 6.5% 2014 is the new norm or does that include some of the benefits of project closeouts in the mining cycle?","Biggs Porter","It does clearly include some of the benefits to close out of mining cycle and we had really good performance on infrastructure as well in 2014. So those margins are higher than what we would expect going forward. It should move back somewhere towards a norm of 4% to 5% over the next year.","Alex Rygiel","That\u2019s helpful. And then as it relates to some of the pipeline projects like NEXUS or reverse osmosis, can you talk about how Fluor is going to be controlling the critical path and how should we think about margins in the pipeline business for Fluor, they are closer to the Oil & Gas average or they are going to be more or like the mining segment given the quantity of materials associated with pipelines?","David Seaton","Well it\u2019s a different kind of, it\u2019s more of a logistics and a supply chain program than a traditional Oil & Gas, so I\u2019d say we\u2019d moderate more towards the mining side, but not vastly. But controlling the critical path of those projects is controlling the supply chain and assuring delivery of what you need when you need it.","And as I said, we\u2019ve spent a lot of time and effort on that will continue to do so. So I feel pretty good about being able to control our own destiny on those projects.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Steven Fisher with UBS. Your line is now open.","Steven Fisher","Hi, good morning.","David Seaton","Good morning, Steve.","Steven Fisher","I found here the power profitability at 4.1, I am not sure if there were something specific in there as they drew it up, but it\u2019s certainly a new higher level, is it a level that you think we can build off from here or should we still expect it to be up and down for a little while?","David Seaton","I\u2019ll let Biggs talk a little bit about it, but I\u2019d say that we\u2019ve kind of bottomed - we bottomed out in Power and we\u2019re starting to see growth in front of us. We\u2019ve also just started some pretty large projects. So again you are kind of in those early stages. Biggs, can you?","Biggs Porter","The other thing effecting power on a segment reported basis is that on this scale the recovery we\u2019ve recorded from our DEO cost share was a little bit higher in the fourth quarter, so that improved segment results as well.","Steven Fisher","Okay. And then overall the Oil & Gas, Dave, you\u2019ve talked about this a number of times on this call already but can you just maybe talk a little bit more about why you think you\u2019re not going into say a couple of year down cycle in Oil & Gas, what is that your customers are telling you, I know they are still optimistic but why couldn\u2019t this be a couple of year downturn before pick back up, you know I think kind of one of the debate of investors right now?","David Seaton","Well, I guess - that\u2019s a great question and I kind of pressed it by this before I get to answer. Each of the oil companies have said that they are going to limit their capital spend which says that the marginal projects are probably going to get delayed further. But look it going after a piece of the - our customers\u2019 capital spend. We\u2019ve spent a lot of time on which projects are going to go forward.","So I think when you look at why we\u2019re focused on the projects that matter. I had a conversation with one customers last week as a matter of fact, they said, you know we still got to add 200,000 barrels just away to tread water. So these companies are going to continue to replace their reserved based, they are going to continue to look at a value added products, they are going to continue to improve their businesses. They are just going to be a little bit more thoughtful in which projects go forwards and which projects need a little bit work.","But clearly as you can see with our new award for this quarter, decisions were still being made, NEXUS being a great example where in the first quarter they\u2019ve made a decision to go forward with these products based on their customer needs.","So yeah, I think drilling rig count is a problem, but we don\u2019t do that business. I think some marginal field developments may take a little bit of a breath but again that\u2019s not something that our backlog is exposed to. But at the same token, low prices are really exciting to the chemical producers, so as an example.","So again I think that you really can\u2019t paint Fluor or our market with the same brush as the - as this painted for the oil and gas market. So A, we\u2019re choosing the right project that are going to go forward and being very, very successful on. B, we\u2019ve taken the effort to become much more competitive and profitable. And C, I don\u2019t think this is a long, I mean it\u2019s - it depends on what long-term, you to find long-term. I think that \u201915 is going to be a little bit of a hard year relative to order intake, but it really don\u2019t damage our growth potential for \u201816, necessarily for \u201916, \u201917 and beyond.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Andy Wittmann with Robert W. Baird. Your line is now open.","Andrew Wittmann","Hi guys, thanks for taking my questions. David, I wanted to get your perspective a little bit on the change in the executive compensation plan, that was announced a couple of weeks ago. Previously the long-term plan was based on gross margin of new awards and new award in total. It like for \u201915, the emphasis has been places on EPS growth over the longer period of time as well as return on assets employed. Given that, what\u2019s the thought process around that, is that just a recognition that there is going to have to be a little bit more operational focus from the board given that the award side is maybe slowing down, is that a peeved point, I think some perspective as to why those changes are made that would be helpful.","David Seaton","Disclosure loss, it\u2019s pretty simple. I still believe and many of our people are still compensated on the basis of new award margin and percent margin, dollar and percent margin because I think that\u2019s the best indicator of future help, the future earnings of the company. We are not going to disclose the metrics around there.","So what we\u2019ve is, we\u2019ve changed to EPS in returns specifically to avoid disclosing something that we think is a competitive metric.","Andrew Wittmann","Gotcha. So in the past, you\u2019ve been able to not disclose and still be incentivized on that but in the future there were some change that you didn\u2019t feel like you could still do that?","David Seaton","Correct. Correct.","Andrew Wittmann","Okay, great.","David Seaton","You know, to the - kind of the under turn of your comment, we\u2019ve always been focused on both growth as well as delivery. So regardless of what we change it to our focus is still on flawless execution and certainty of cost and schedule to our customers.","Andrew Wittmann","Got it, that\u2019s helpful. Just for Biggs on mining, you guys have given over the last years, as mining has been in focused, some details what that business is doing. Can you give us now that \u201914 is in the books, but the revenue contribution was for \u201914 and what your thought is on relative change just for mining as we move into \u201915, so we get our - what that might look like?","Biggs Porter","I actually don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve been disclosing what the revenues are of mining versus infrastructure. We have from time to time reported the backlog number for what was mining and if I get it, I\u2019ll give it to you before the call is over. It\u2019s never right here in front of me. Well outlook for that.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Adam Thalhimer with BB&T Capital Partners. Your line is now open.","Adam Thalhimer","Good morning, guys, congrats in nice quarter.","David Seaton","Thank you.","Adam Thalhimer","Dave, did you said, what\u2019s executives of some of your large customers in Oil & Gas segment over the past few weeks and they still want to move forward on projects. I am just curious, they - are they acting new any concessions, if you cut your price a little bit will help us kind of move this forward or is - have that not really come up?","David Seaton","No, it\u2019s come up. I think the dialog is more around proper scope management and effective implementation supply chain things we\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ve had some customer that have asked for unit rate that kind of reductions but not significantly so. And to be honest, I believe that\u2019s a little short sighted because that\u2019s not where the real money is, real money is in the supply chain and how we implement construction.","Adam Thalhimer","Okay and then in Oil & Gas segment, I am still trying to get a sense for when some of the larger projects move into the construction sales, is that kind of like for this some of the largest project you are working on it like a middle \u201915s or early \u201915 or late \u201915?","David Seaton","Well, I mean if you about the three crackers, we\u2019re already in the field on all three of them in some form of fashion and because they are still in their stages. So some of the big stuff, we\u2019re already - we\u2019re already out there. Typically you are going to look at from the award of the EPC, you\u2019re going to look at, I don\u2019t know six to nine months before you really get into the field and earnest.","So we\u2019ll be going into the field in some of the projects in \u201915 just on plan. There is a couple that have pushed to the right just a little bit. But I guess the point I\u2019d make is that we haven\u2019t had any cancelations, all we\u2019ve had is delays in terms of FIDs and which quarter or which fiscal year those things go forward, which speaks to the command I made about how sure we are about what we take into backlog and which project that we go after. So we\u2019re kind of hitting the field in some case now and we\u2019ll continue to do so as we go through the year.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Brian Konigsberg with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Brian Konigsberg","Hi good morning, guys.","David Seaton","Good morning.","Brian Konigsberg","Hey, just coming back to the opportunities that are on the petrochemical crackers, so it had fixed on the market already and you noted there is - in the pipeline there is a number of additional opportunities. So do you believe the U.S. or I am sure if that is specifically U.S. but can U.S. be meaningfully more than six crackers, you take on that if not where the other opportunities?","David Seaton","Well I mean they are in North American the ones I am speaking off. And I think there is room for more.","Brian Konigsberg","Okay and then - I mean the second question, I noticed in your 10-K noting that the burn rate and just coming back to the question just around burn at \u201915, 44% of your backlog will be burned in \u201915, that actually that\u2019s a pretty market slowdown from what we saw last year actually in place of revenue coming from backlog is down maybe 1% in \u201915 versus what you had in \u201914. And I am sure how much you could comment on this, but if you if you just take the consults number, I would suggest that the booking burn in \u201915 would have almost more than double which I guess is seem to be tough just considering the backdrop or talking about. Is that the right way we should be looking at it and if so, I mean why would that consults never be close to being right?","David Seaton","Let me start and ask Biggs to give his thoughts. As I said earlier, we are kind of in a situation where you are in varying states of projects and the burn on these projects is heavily weighted towards the backend ones we get to the field and because at that point you\u2019ve purchased most of the equipment materials, so you are getting towards the end. On all of the three crackers that I spoke off, you are still in the early, early stages even though we are already in the field in some cases.","I give an example we\u2019re in a very early stages of the cracker construction that we\u2019re in a very stages in Sasol and we\u2019re a little further along in CPChem. So the burn in \u201914 was minimal of three those relative to the overall revenue burn. I think the most important metric frankly is the margin burn and the fact they were improving our margin performance over the last probably eight quarters across the boards and specifically in Oil & Gas. I don\u2019t know if Biggs if you like to comment.","Biggs Porter","I\u2019ll just make couple of comments. The 44% is down from what we would have printed last year at this time in the 10-K ever. I think as things turned out, the percentage burned off in 2014 was probably below what we expected when we printed the 10-K last year. And if you recall 2014, we didn\u2019t have as many projects moved in the construction as soon as possible, so revenues were down a little bit more, there are down below what we initially expected. And so that might not be that bigger difference between the burn rates that we actually had last year what we expect this year.","Do thing that revenues are going to grow in 2015. It should be double digit, 10% or higher. Anyway you fit all that together I think that at the end of the day our booking burn for this year on the Oil & Gas is expected to be too different from what we had in the past.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Dudas with Sterne, Agee. Your line is now open.","Michael Dudas","Hi, good morning, everyone.","David Seaton","Hi Michael.","Michael Dudas","Dave, could you comment on outlook for large infrastructure projects, could we anticipate maybe a billion dollar type project that you booked in 2015 others and is it certainly driven by public, private and some of the financing away from step that could be coming on Washington and added clarity on the future expand?","David Seaton","I think probably private is clearly the approach of choice in terms of North American infrastructure. You know I wouldn\u2019t comment where there is a billion dollar in the works, so I would just say there is a lot of them in the works. But the development phases of those are significantly longer in the significantly cycle like an Oil & Gas project if you will.","So I think that there is a couple of projects as I said in North America that they were focused on, there is a couple that are between say 300 million and 700 million but I\u2019d say there is not anything in the current view that would book in \u201815 that\u2019s over a billion.","Michael Dudas","Like all of would be on the Middle East, some of the budget numbers given where energy prices are from the national oil companies, do you feel comfortable with some of those numbers that have put out there and are there any political issues in that region right now that could cause some pullback or shift in the mix of budge we\u2019re spending in that work, that\u2019s next to four [ph]?","David Seaton","Well, as you know I lived out there for a long time and stayed very close to that part of the world. I would characterize at this way, this is no different than the last three or four times I\u2019ve seen all dropped. I told you guys, we\u2019re in Huston, back last year, I mean I remember when it hit $17 a barrel in 1997 and if we go back two years part of that over the $11 and the capital spend of our customers to maintain that reserve based stayed very robust.","So I think the NOCs are no different than IOCs in terms of what their long-term views are and their okay when you got 50-60 buck oil. So I guess the hedge I would make is, we see a significant drop which I don\u2019t anticipate in oil price, he could see some change. But at the current levels, there is looking long-term, I really don\u2019t see any significant change I think in the near term and their spending is.","Politically I mean you read the same papers I do, I mean the places always been a little bit difficult in terms of how things go forward and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s changed today. I will say that it doesn\u2019t worry particularly what\u2019s going on right now in terms of short term impact on business even with the stride that you\u2019ve seen and the terrorist activities that are going on. But it\u2019s still a great place for us and our customers aren\u2019t changing there their spending habits that this point.","Biggs Porter","This is Biggs, I just underlying to that question, just want to follow-up on the other question on money backlog. The amount of the money backlog at the end of the year was around $2.5 billion. So with we go to the next question.","Operator","We\u2019ll take our next question from Anna Kaminskaya with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.","Anna Kaminskaya","Hi, good morning, guys. My first question was regarding, just going back to gas margins which is what 7% of the energy CapEx in the U.S. and seemingly more leap availability, does it enhance your margin on the existing projects that all or just given most of it is cost price doesn\u2019t really change the profile?","David Seaton","See Anna, I don\u2019t take to this fact to this cost plus changes to profile, I still feel that there were in a good shape relative to us being able to deliver the margin that we anticipate that when we took it into backlog. I don\u2019t see any change, any market change there at all.","Anna Kaminskaya","Okay, so you don\u2019t think it helps your margin enhance?","David Seaton","I don\u2019t think it will help.","Anna Kaminskaya","Okay. And then just if what we think about just changes in your business model, you talked a lot about more fabrication capabilities and logistics investments, does it change your soft market profile in the Oil & Gas business, just in terms cyclicality and if we do go into the downturn?","David Seaton","No, I don\u2019t think it has any impact and I am not sure what you mean my soft margins necessarily I mean clearly, if we\u2019re going to control the critical path of the schedule as I\u2019ve said before, we got to do certain things ourselves which in some cases is margin in the past that others earned as a subcontract. So that does help us to that degree, but relative to backlog and what we are going after that approach is already been embedded in how we\u2019ve taken those projects into backlog.","Biggs Porter","I would add that the fabrication assets we\u2019ve added have been through joint venture, so that cost is a share cost, it gives us an adequate degree of control over the critical path as David stated, but it\u2019s gone on a fairly efficient basis for us.","Operator","And we\u2019ll take our last question from John Rogers with Davidson. Your line is now open.","John Rogers","Hi thanks for getting me. Two different follow-ups; first of all I guess Biggs maybe, in terms of cash flow last couple of years it\u2019s matched with net income pretty well, would we expect the same in 2015?","Biggs Porter","Yeah, I actually add some commentary on 2014. We actually had about little over $200 million that we would have expected in 2014 that came in early January. So was expecting a bigger fourth quarter then what we actually had, that money came into 2015 instead and so that\u2019s obviously helpful to 2015. Having said that, I have to also note so that everybody doesn\u2019t forget about it, for the first quarter that we did have a $300 million settlement payment that we made in January as well. So if you are looking at without that the consideration, you\u2019d say we should expect a very good year for 2015, it will be tempered by the fact that we made the payment.","John Rogers","And then David, just following-up on your comments relative to controlling some of the critical path and supply chain and you\u2019ve mentioned fabrication but are there other areas that you can point to now that you think have notable in significant competitive advantages in terms of controlling this chain and you enter on areas that you want to get better control of?","David Seaton","I feel good about where we are, but it goes back several years worked, in Oil & Gas, Peter Oosterveer and his team and his team did in terms of looking at the capital efficiency of the programs. And what I mean by capital efficiency is are we designing serial number one that has a significant associated with it and a risk or ROE developing scopes that don\u2019t have serial number one equipment in it that are trying true. ROE designing based on design margins that are reasonable or have we allow the customers to lighter those such that steel is bigger, pumps are bigger, motors are bigger, those kinds of things.","So the first part of it is around the physical scope is there. I think our ability to control our own destiny in the fabrication yards to A, ensure our position in shop. B, to manage the quality and the performance of the shops is critical in terms of cost and in terms of delivering those modules when and where they need to be.","I think in terms of construction and a process plant, the critical path runs through the piping account. Well on a direct hour basis that\u2019s the scope that I want to do our sales, because again you are controlling your own destiny in a critical path schedule. I think that I could go on and on and on the things that, that we\u2019ve done to improve our ability to perform effectively there.","So I mean there is a lot that we\u2019ve done that gives us comfort that we can continue to perform for our customers and be best in class.","Operator","And we have no further questions at this time. I\u2019ll now turn it back to our speakers for any additional or closing comments.","David Seaton","Thank you, operator and I appreciate everybody participating on our call today. But as I said in my opening remarks, we are focused on maintaining our competiveness and growing our profitability and I think what we got in front of us clearly allows us to do that. I think both were essential for growing shareholder value and attracting the right talent and meeting and exceeding our client expectations. Again we\u2019ve done a lot of work around making sure that we are being thoughtful to our customers around the competitiveness that they need in the capital efficiency, but we\u2019re doing so in terms of being able to provide an integrated cost effective solution to the issues that they are dealing with.","I believing we\u2019re taking and we\u2019ll continue to take the actions that we need to be more competitive in a pretty volatile market but again not at the expense of profitability which I believe is a true credit to our leaders and our employees.","With that I greatly appreciate your interest and confidence you have in our company and we wish everyone a good day. Thank you.","Operator","This does conclude today\u2019s teleconference. You may now disconnect. Thank you and have a great day."]}}
