If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","C. Dan Smith","Thank you, and good morning. With me today to discuss our third quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at www.acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments, and then we will answer your questions. First off, we are quite pleased with our results for the third quarter. Our net sales grew 11% this quarter, which was meaningfully higher compared with the estimated low-single-digit growth rates of the key markets we serve. While there were 3 unusual items in our third quarter numbers, noise, if you will, and we will explain those in a moment, we feel we delivered very solid results while achieving success on numerous strategic priorities.","You will recall from our previous calls and SEC filings, we expected market demand to show signs of improvement in our second half. While we believe this occurred, there were still inconsistency in orders. However, in spite of this variability, Acuity, again, achieved meaningful sales volume growth. In fact, this was our 13th quarter in a row of sales volume growth.","We believe this is, yet again, positive evidence of our strategies to provide our customers with differentiated value propositions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend to our leadership position in North America. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting solutions; expansion in key channels and geographies; and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter. However, before doing so, I would like to comment on the noise in our numbers.","First, as we noted in our last 10-Q, we became aware of a fraud perpetrated at a freight service provider to the company earlier this third quarter. After significant investigation, we now estimate the cost to Acuity of this fraud and related expenses is $8.1 million. We recorded the loss this quarter, which is included in our selling, distribution and administrative expense. Unfortunately, Acuity was one of approximately 50 companies impacted by this fraud.","Second, we incurred $800,000 of incremental expenses this quarter for the last of the temporary inefficiencies associated with the Cochran plant closure. We are pleased to have this behind us.","Lastly, we took a special charge of $7.2 million this quarter for additional streamlining actions that included the elimination of certain salaried positions and the consolidation of certain small manufacturing facilities. We also had a special charge in the year-ago quarter as well. Ricky will provide more details, including projected savings on the current charge later in the call.","We find it helpful to add back these items as adjustments to provide an enhanced understanding of the company's current financial performance and prospects for the future. Now let us review our results for the third quarter.","Net sales for the quarter were almost $542 million, an increase of more than 11% compared with the year-ago period. This level of growth was significant given general economic and industry conditions.","Reported operating profit was $50 million. However, adjusted operating profit was $66.1 million compared with $59.2 million for the year-ago period, an increase of 12%; while adjusted operating profit margin was 12.2%, 10 basis points higher than the year -- than in the year-ago period.","Adjusted EBITDA was a robust 14.6% of net sales. Diluted earnings per share were $0.73. Adjusted EPS for the current quarter was $0.97 compared with $0.82 in the year-ago period, an increase of more than 18%.","There are a number of key items to note regarding the results for the third quarter. While net sales grew over 11% compared with a year ago, we estimate sales volume grew approximately 14% this quarter. This level of sales volume growth was particularly noteworthy given the overall market conditions I mentioned earlier.","We estimate the impact of price changes and the mix of products sold reduced net sales by approximately 3%. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and product mix changes, we believe the difference was primarily due to changes in channel mix, as well as the mix of products sold and, to a lesser degree, lower pricing on like-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain LED component costs.","The impact of acquisitions in foreign currency on net sales was not significant. The growth in net sales was reasonably broad-based along many product lines, though certain specialty fixtures more closely associated with new construction lagged the overall average due to the tepid environment for new nonresidential construction.","From a channel perspective, we experienced strong growth in the commercial, industrial and infrastructure channels, as well as continued growth for larger renovation projects. The mix of products sold on these larger renovation projects tend to have a lower gross profit margin profile than our overall average margin. We also continue to experience higher mix of sales of less-featured, value-oriented products sold through certain channels, primarily for renovation, which also tend to have a lower-than-average margin profile.","In spite of top line -- of strong top line growth this year, the change in both product and sales channel mix were the primary contributors to a consistent adjusted gross profit margin this quarter compared with the year ago.","Sales growth in our largest channel, commercial and industrial, was slightly above this quarter's overall percentage increase, primarily due to a continued focus on smaller- and medium-sized projects for both new construction and renovation, as well as continued emphasis on selling higher value-added lighting solutions, especially LED luminaires, which grew again by more than 2.5x compared with the year-ago period.","Additionally, we enjoyed growth in our residential products as demand for new housing and renovation of existing homes continued to rebound. We continue to experience growth in most geographies and channels in North America, all of which is encouraging, though this was offset somewhat by the continued weakness in Europe.","Excluding LED luminaires, we believe the puts and takes for product pricing, as well as material and component costs, were again fairly benign this quarter. Looking at overall market conditions for the third quarter, we believe spending in key segments of the U.S. nonresidential construction market was down slightly compared with the year ago, while residential construction was up more than 20%. Further, we believe the overall lighting market was up low mid-single digits during the quarter supported by growth in renovation, as well as the residential market. This is in stark contrast compared with the growth in our net sales in North America, which was up more than 11%.","Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions and the strength of our many sales forces, have allowed us to achieve meaningful sales growth again this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and the strategic accomplishments in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the 3 items I noted earlier, adjusted operating profit margin for the third quarter was a solid 12.2%, up modestly compared with a year ago. This is particularly noteworthy given that sales of LED luminaires now make up almost 20% of our total sales.","Further, as Ricky will discuss later in the call, adjusted gross profit margin was 41%, down 40 basis points compared with the prior year. From a margin perspective, we believe benefits from the higher sales volume were offset by the meaningful shift in product and sales channel mix, as noted earlier. The mix shift was primarily due to the positive influx of large renovation projects awarded to Acuity even though they tend to have a lower margin profile as compared with fixtures shipped, for example, to projects with a high degree of specification influence within the C&I channel.","Also, as noted earlier, we continue to experience a greater mix of less-featured, value-oriented products sold through certain channels. The impact of product and sales channel mix was partially offset by lower material and component cost, as well as productivity improvements associated with our streamlining efforts.","The slight decline in adjusted gross profit margin was more than offset by a similar improvement in adjusted selling, distribution and administrative expenses, which were 28.8% of net sales in the quarter, compared with 29.3% in the year-ago period. Total adjusted SD&A expenses were $155.8 million, up about 9% this quarter compared with the year-ago period, primarily to support the growth in sales volume this quarter.","On the strategic front, we continued our rapid pace of introductions of new products, significantly expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions. As I mentioned earlier, our solid-state lighting portfolio continues to expand rapidly, as are the sales of these luminaires. Today, almost 20% of our net sales are from LED luminaires. And we continue to fund the development of holistic lighting solutions for specific applications, such as schools, health care facilities, commercial office buildings and various outdoor applications, to fully leverage our award-winning portfolio of lighting fixtures, controls and components.","More impressively, as I noted earlier, our adjusted operating profit margin continued to remain solid, while sales of LED-based solutions are a growing portion of our overall business. Acuity is the clear leader in digital lighting solutions. It is because we understand lighting and the sophisticated needs of our expansive customer base. We are able to offer customers tailored solutions from our industry-leading portfolio regardless of the light source, and we continue to add even more capabilities, including the recent acquisition of eldoLED. eldoLED is a leader in the design and manufacture of high-performance, intelligent drivers for LED-based lighting systems. The acquisition of eldoLED gives us and our OEM customer\u2019s unique capabilities to provide unparalleled lighting solutions to the ultimate end user, including complete dimability, color-changing and tunable light solutions, which eliminate the stroboscopic effects that are prevalent with many of the LED fixtures in the industry today.","As I've noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during eras of technology disruption. Today is clearly no different. Acuity Brands is leading the evolution to intelligent lighting solutions with its broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor solid-state and traditional energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls, and we are delivering profitable growth and strong financial returns for our shareholders while making these important investments.","I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2013 and beyond. Ricky?","Richard K. Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight a few items regarding our income statement, including the special charge, temporary production inefficiencies and the fraud-related loss. I then will discuss our cash flow and financial conditions before turning the call back to Vern.","Vern covered the primary drivers for our sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items, but I will provide a bit more color on certain aspects of our third quarter results. Let's first look at our special charge related to streamlining activities.","In the third quarter of fiscal 2013, we continued our efforts to streamline the organization through the planned closure of certain small production facilities, as well as the realignment of responsibilities primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. We recognized a pretax special charge related to our streamlining actions totaling $7.2 million, or $0.11 diluted EPS.","The pretax special charge consist almost entirely of severance and employee-related costs. The production facilities we are closing manufacture less than 2% of our total production, and we expect to complete the closure and related transfer of production by the end of the calendar year. We currently expect to incur production transfer expense and other costs of approximately $2 million over the next 2 fiscal quarters related to this streamlining action.","We estimate the total annualized pretax savings associated with this streamlining action to be approximately $15 million, and we expect to realize $2 million in our fourth fiscal quarter and to be at the full annualized run rate by the end of the calendar year, assuming the production transfers occur according to current plans.","These savings should help fund important investments we are continuing to make to expand our product and solution portfolio and enhance our production distribution and customer service and support capabilities.","In addition to this special charge, we incurred $0.8 million, or $0.01 diluted EPS, of higher pretax cost related to temporary manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the closing of the Cochran, Georgia facility which we initiated last fiscal year. We currently expect no further cost related to this streamlining effort, and we are now at the total annualized saving rate of approximately $8 million from this streamlining action.","We also incurred a pretax loss of $8.1 million, or $0.12 diluted EPS, resulting from a fraud perpetrated at Trendset, Inc., a freight payment and audit service firm formerly retained by the company. As we previously reported in our second quarter 10-Q, on March 25, 2013, Trendset notified its customers that all freight payment services would immediately cease as a result of a fraud at Trendset. We incurred this loss primarily because funds we dispersed to Trendset were not subsequently remitted to freight carriers that provided services on our behalf.","We are aggressively seeking recovery for this loss through multiple sources. Numerous other Trendset customers are also pursuing claims against Trendset for their losses, and several with significant losses filed an involuntary petition commencing a bankruptcy proceeding against Trendset under Chapter 11 of the U.S. bankruptcy code. Based on information currently available, we cannot estimate the amount or timing of any potential recovery, if any. Based on GAAP, any future recovery will be recorded when realized.","As Vern said earlier, we find it useful to adjust our results for these 3 items to make them more comparable, and we have included in our earnings release a full reconciliation of our GAAP amounts to these adjusted results. As Vern mentioned earlier, our adjusted gross profit margin of 41% decreased 40 basis points compared with the year-ago period on a more-than-11% increase in net sales, due largely to an unfavorable price mix, partially offset by the favorable impact of increased net sales, lower material and component costs, productivity improvements and realized benefits from the previously mentioned streamlining actions.","However, our adjusted operating profit margin increased 10 basis points to 12.2% compared with the adjusted operating margin in the year-ago period as we were able to offset the unfavorable gross margin percentage comparison.","Our adjusted SD&A expense as a percent of net sales declined to 28.8%, or 50 basis points below the same period last year, and the lowest it has been since fiscal year 2009, demonstrating we are seeing the benefits from the investments we have made in our business and the streamlining of our organization.","Let's next turn our attention to some of our results below the operating earnings line. Miscellaneous income of $3 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 consists primarily of gains associated with asset sales of an empty facility and idle equipment. The miscellaneous income is just slightly more than the miscellaneous income recognized in the third quarter of last year that was due primarily to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Mexican peso-denominated items.","The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 29.9% compared with 35.8% in the third quarter of last year. This lower effective tax rate was due primarily to the favorable impact of a reduction in certain income tax reserves. We estimate the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year of 2013 will be approximately 35% if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","Now let's look at the cash flow for the 9 months ended May 31, 2013. Cash flow generated from operations for the first 9 months of fiscal year 2013 were $67.8 million compared with $102.8 million generated from operating activities in the prior year period. This decrease in cash flow from operating activities during the first 9 months of fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to an increase in account receivables and a decrease in accrued incentive compensation compared with the same period last year. The increase in accounts receivable is due to greater sales than last year's, while the days outstanding for receivables is flat at May 31, 2013, compared with the prior year. Cash flow provided by operations in the third quarter of this year increased almost $3 million compared to the third quarter of fiscal year 2012. Total operating working capital of 40 days at May 31, 2013, was flat compared with the prior year.","In the first 9 months of fiscal year 2013, we spent $31.4 million on capital expenditures compared with only $18.8 million in the prior year period, or an increase of $12.6 million. This increase in expenditures is largely related to the capital associated with adding additional capacity in the plants receiving the production transfer from Cochran, expansion of manufacturing capabilities in certain other locations and tooling associated with a large number of new products recently developed. We currently expect to spend approximately $40 million in capital expenditures in the full fiscal year 2013.","This higher level of expected full year fiscal spending as compared with the recent past is influenced by approximately $5 million related to facility improvements to accommodate the closure of the Cochran facility and an additional $5 million related to the refurbishment of a furnace at the glass manufacturing facility, which is required approximately every 5 years.","At May 31, 2013, we had a cash balance of $302 million and total debt of $354 million. At the end of the third quarter of fiscal 2013, net debt to total capitalization was 5%.","At May 31, 2013, we had additional borrowing capacity of $244.3 million under our credit facility that does not mature until January 2017. So we continue to maintain a significant amount of financial flexibility.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities. While we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to add a few more observations to what we mentioned earlier regarding our expectations for the balance of 2013.","First, as we have noted before, while we expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging, we anticipate that businesses and consumers in North America will accelerate their investments as uncertainties over U.S. fiscal issues dissipate and the economy continues to improve.","Forecasts by independent organizations for industry growth continue to vary widely. The consensus estimate for growth rates in key segments of the nonresidential market for new construction in the U.S. for 2013 is in the lower mid-single digits, while sales for lighting fixtures are expected to be modestly higher, supported by renovation and retrofit activity and a growing residential market. This suggests that expected growth in the broad lighting market in North America will be in the mid-single-digit range for the balance of calendar 2013. This is closely -- or excuse me, this is reasonably consistent with the outlook we provided in our recent SEC filings.","Also, as we noted earlier, there are other signs that continue to give us optimism regarding the future growth of our business. Leading indicators, such as Architecture Billings Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the rebound in residential construction, continue to be favorable. As you know, there is a lag in the new construction cycle between the design phase of projects and the ultimate purchase of lighting fixtures and controls.","Therefore, while we see -- while we still see some volatility in demand among certain channels and geographies, our expectation for the balance of calendar 2013 is that overall demand in our end markets will continue to improve and be more consistent and broad-based. The favorable trend in our June order rate seems to support this level of improvement.","Second, the industry continues to experience some volatility with respect to input cost. While some commodity costs have waned, others continue to rise. As of now, we expect material input cost to be relatively flat for the fourth quarter, except for certain LED components, which should continue to decline.","Further, we expect employee-related cost will continue to rise due to wage inflation and the negative impact of Obamacare on health care cost. Of course, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture and efforts to drive productivity improvements to help offset rising costs.","Next, while our gross profit margin is influenced by volume as well as product and channel mix, we expect our gross profit margins to improve over time as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix, and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","Additionally, we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and channels. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly, we expect to continue to outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform. As I noted in our last several conference calls, our strategies to drive profitable growth remain intact. We continue to see opportunities in this environment, including benefits from growing portions of the market, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels and growth from the introduction of new lighting solutions.","As the industry leader in North America, we believe we are uniquely positioned with key suppliers around the globe to continue to bring greater and more differentiated value to our customers, incorporating advanced technologies, providing superior lighting quality and more sustainable energy solutions. Our product and solutions portfolios continue to expand rapidly, including now 7 strategic acquisitions over the last few years with the recent addition of the eldoLED team. The acquisition of eldoLED, while small today in terms of revenues, is a meaningful addition to our growing portfolio of LED-based lighting solutions, an area of significant focus and growth potential for Acuity.","Our strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading portfolio and solutions, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities. This all takes focus and resources. We are funding these activities today because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market, and our sales growth this quarter reflects what we believe are the early stages of this opportunity. As I've said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront. We continue to believe the many markets we serve, as part of the broader lighting industry, could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential. As the market leader, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Shawn Lockman from Piper Jaffray.","Shawn E. Lockman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Just wanted to see if you could give us just a little bit of more detail on the puts and takes on gross margins. While I know that on a year-over-year basis they may have kind of ticked down, they sequentially improved and are obviously kind of moving in the right direction. You expressed some confidence that those margins will continue to improve. Can you talk a little bit about kind of -- just a little more detail in terms of the factors that will influence that manufacturing efficiencies, pricing mix, those kinds of factors?","Vernon J. Nagel","So as we think about our margin profile, let me just provide a little bit more background information. While it's impossible to precisely calculate this number, we believe that approximately half of our revenues today are involved in some form of renovation and retrofit. And as we think about that business dynamic -- or that market dynamic, it has an influence on the margin profile that we enjoy. Obviously, when we sell products into large projects that have a broad portfolio of products that are going into that project, hence they have a higher mix than renovation, where a renovation of certain retail spaces, for example, maybe more of a singular or few products that tend to be more competitive. Our expectation is, is that we will experience this type of margin profile for a while until new construction starts to come back and becomes a more traditional percentage of our overall business. We are very excited to continue to win these types of renovation projects. I think it demonstrates our unique capability to really tailor lighting solutions. But because of the size and nature and the competitive nature of some of those types of projects, it tends to have a lesser-than-average margin profile. We've look hard to offset those types of things through productivity improvements, through cost reductions in terms of design. When we think about products that we're selling into certain channels that are, again, for renovation of homes, these are products that Acuity did not have a robust portfolio in the past, when it was more conventional incandescent-type lighting. So we're very excited to be penetrating these channels, but they typically come with lower margin profile. I think the exciting news from an investor's perspective is Acuity is realizing penetration into that renovation world, and we've yet to really see the fulsomeness of the return of new construction, which is starting to happen. Again, as I mentioned earlier, leading indicators are flashing favorable signs, and I think that we're in the early stages of what will probably be a fairly long run in terms of new construction. So it's our expectation that over time, as these -- as the mix of our business comes back to more historical norms, we will enjoy the benefit of improved gross margins, as well as operating profit margins.","Shawn E. Lockman - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","That's very helpful. I mean, if I kind of move down the P&L here to OpEx, it's about 29% of revenues this quarter, I believe. Is this a good way to kind of look at OpEx going forward or should we continue to see that kind of shrink as a percentage of overall revenues? I know you mentioned that there will be some ongoing sort of inflation costs and so forth, but how should we think about that in terms of the changes you guys have made in terms of streamlining and then also Obamacare and some other factors?","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes. I would offer 2 comments there. With the acquisitions, the recent acquisitions of Adura and eldoLED, we have added more SD&A expenses. The revenues to offset those are coming. But right now, I would expect that our SD&A expense, with all the puts and takes of acquisition, streamlining capabilities, to probably now be in the $93 million to $95 million range. As you recall, I said that we were in the kind of $88 million to $92 million range, so roughly around an average of $90 million. We do expect that, with these acquisitions, that, that will have ticked up. Additionally, our variable cost, freight and commissions is probably in the 11.3 to 11.7 range. Again, it depends on the mix percentage of sales. So I would expect us to continue to drive revenue growth over that fixed investment base. The acquisitions that we have made recently are very exciting for us. It gives us a unique opportunity to provide capability, not only for our portfolio, but for OEM customers to advance their opportunities. So Acuity will continue to sell more and more components to the industry because we see opportunities, obviously, to do that. So yes, you should expect us to leverage that fixed investment base, but that fixed investment base has gone up because of these acquisitions recently.","Richard K. Reece","Just to clarify that $93 million, $95 million, that's fixed portion of the SD&A cost per month.","Vernon J. Nagel","Per quarter, Ricky.","Richard K. Reece","Pardon me, per quarter. Correct.","Vernon J. Nagel","Let's be very clear. That is $93 million to $95 million of what we consider fixed, though there is some variability per quarter.","Richard K. Reece","Right. Right.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt McCall from BB&T Capital Markets.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So Vern, one word we didn't hear and we haven't heard as much is the control side. And I know you don't break it out as a separate category now, but I'm just curious about the trend there. How -- what's the percent of penetration from a luminaire perspective, how -- what's the attachment rate, if you will? And any color around -- is it progressing as expected? And maybe, what's the margin or growth benefit as you see more penetration of controls moving forward?","Vernon J. Nagel","Matt, that question is a fantastic question because it brings -- it highlights for us the difficulty that we are having in trying to identify sales volume versus price mix versus channel and product mix. The world is coming together as we had predicted, if you will 5 years ago, and the integration of Lighting Controls into the luminaire and how we control that is occurring. Our ability to send -- to sell integrated lighting solutions as part of a holistic package are continuing to grow. Virtually all of our LED luminaires have some type of lighting control element as part of them, and so those LED luminaires now represent 20% of our revenues. When we look at some of the discrete components that we would sell into the marketplace, we continue -- from a controls perspective, we continue to see growth. We actually see growth accelerating pretty significantly in our nLight program, the ability to again tie luminaires together in a holistic lighting solution that then further gets tied into energy and building management. So we are experiencing again solid growth there. The issue on the margin side -- and we're very pleased, by the way, with our margins. For us to have delivered 41% gross margins, a 12.2% operating profit margin while seeing the LED side of our business continuing to grow, I think it\u2019s pretty robust. There are reports out there that others have made that suggest that based on what Zumtobel is doing, we should see a decline in our margins. To be clear, at least yet to see the significant turnaround in new construction that I think is before us, and yet we continue to grow our top line meaningfully in that renovation area broadly defined, small, medium, large-type renovation projects, which typically -- or tend to have lower overall margins. So all of this is working as we have planned, and I think that we are, again, uniquely positioned to leverage our platform and portfolio.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And maybe as a follow-up, Vern, my second question, you talked a lot about mix, whether it be project or some of the stock and flow, whether it be renovation versus new. And you talked about the mix impact from renovation. What -- is there -- have you provided any detail about the estimated margin impact from that mix, from more renovation? And if you have -- and if I missed it, I apologize. But just curious, as that shift moves, if we can kind of point to a margin improvement trend based on mix shift toward more construction?","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, I think that, as we pointed out, we believe, as best as we can estimate, that our sales volume was up 14% in the quarter over the year-ago period. Price, product and channel mix brought that down to slightly above 11% overall growth. So those -- that 3 points had a lot of stuff going on, if you will. And I think that, that is probably a better reflection or a good reflection of the difference between the kinds of margins that we typically enjoy off of new construction, where there's a heavy specification influence, versus those items where they tend to be single-type products, high-volume, competitively bid-type items. Again, we are quite pleased with the performance and the ability for us to penetrate this renovation market aggressively. It really reflects the scale and capabilities of our lighting people to create unique solutions, but they just tend to be lower margin businesses or projects. The other thing I would say on the stock and flow side, again, we are entering portions of the market where Acuity traditionally did not have strength or really presence, and that is in renovation and retrofit-type kits using LED-based luminaires for the residential market. And we're enjoying quite good growth there, and those products are good margins but they're just not at our historical average simply because of the nature of the business and the competitive market that's out there.","Operator","Our next questions comes from Glenn Wortman from Sidoti.","Glenn Wortman - Sidoti & Company, LLC","On the streamlinings [ph] you just announced, what's the breakdown there on savings between cost of goods sold and SD&A?","Vernon J. Nagel","About75% to 80% would be in SD&A and the rest would be in cost of goods sold.","Glenn Wortman - Sidoti & Company, LLC","And then just more of a medium term questions, as your end market continue to recover and hopefully non-res construction comes back, do you think double-digit would be sustainable say over the next 3, 4 or 5 years?","Richard K. Reece","Well as we pointed out earlier, we believe that the markets that we serve have the opportunity to grow by 50% over the next 3+ years. Again our feeling is that the way we have positioned the company with both access to market, product portfolio and again unique capabilities through our acquisitions to allows us to outperform the markets that we serve. So you can do your own modeling and have your own expectations about what that growth rate is going to look like. It would be our expectation to outperform the markets we serve. We are bullish about the future opportunity over the next decade in this industry and more clearly over the next handful of years we see unique growth opportunities to really drive some strong financial performance.","Operator","And our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.","Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Hi this is Josh Chan filling in for Pete. The first question on price mix is as [indiscernible] prices sort of come down, to what extent are you seeing above normal price pressures in our conventional business? Just because of the price decline in the LEDs, I was just wondering if","You\u2019re seeing that effect.","Richard K. Reece","No, actually we aren't. The good news is the value proposition for so many of the fluorescents is still very strong and we are continuing to see good opportunities there and they have not and we believe in certain of our product lines as they go through their product life cycle that we could experience opportunities to enjoy maintaining if not improving margins later on as we continue to reduce costs, continue to manage product cycles. To date, have not seen a decline, product by product. Again, as Vern has been talking about mix and some of those have continued to be not as favorable as a lot of the renovation products we are selling today are still the traditional technologies. Fluorescent is the primary product in many the renovation project in large box retail space for example. But we've been able to see margins consistent with previous periods.","Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","My second question is sticking with the price theme. How would you characterize the ability to perhaps realize price improvement as the construction cycle improves and industry demand improves, how do you expect pricing to play out in that scenario?","Vernon J. Nagel","Our expectation is that we will be able to provide more holistic lighting solutions, where lighting controls are integrated into the luminaire, the luminaire becomes the point source of intelligence, it's capable of doing much more, it's now tied into a holistic lighting and energy management system.at then gets tied into the overall building management system. We believe we will be able to provide, again, unique capability there, and we would expect for an expansion of our margins on those types of products. We're in the very early phases of seeing how this is playing out, and we do believe that we extract the higher margins for significantly greater value-added holistic lighting solutions. Today, it's fascinating to me to watch our ability to leverage our access to market and sell products that are now different than what we would have sold, say, just a handful of years ago, LED-based, retrofit-type luminaires. It's a market where we really did not play in the past in terms of those retrofit opportunities. So this is really fascinating as we expand our access to market, leveraging our sales capabilities. So you're seeing this growth, but not the same variable contribution that you would have typically seen or expected from a dollar increase. Because in the past, that dollar increase in revenues came from project-type business that was generally driven around new construction. When we start to see that come through as well, I think it's going to be an exciting time. I don't expect that to happen, by the way, next quarter or the quarter after that. As I mentioned earlier, the construction cycle takes a while, but we're now seeing higher quotations, quotations for much more comprehensive portfolios of product and lighting solutions, which I think should bode well for us as we think about our 2014 and beyond.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Two questions. The savings from these initiatives on the streamlining activity, does that -- it sounds like that's kind of a flow-through, that, that's going to be reinvested into the business. Is that -- did I catch that right from the earlier commentary?","Richard K. Reece","A portion of it will. Some of it will make up some of the investments we've been making, if you look back at the guidance that was provided earlier in the call, of the $93 million to $95 million a quarter in the more fixed, semi-fixed portion of SD&A. We're factoring in some of the savings from the streamline saving -- activity to help fund some of that. So you're right, that's not 100%. I wouldn't want everybody to model in that -- 100% of that $15 million or the 75% to 80% of that, that's SD&A, that we're going to not need to reinvest some of that as we continue. But there will be some benefits from those activities.","Vernon J. Nagel","And Ricky, we would expect that wage, typical wage inflation and typical health care cost will consume some of that. So many of these moves are to help us redeploy assets into higher return areas. But it's also to maintain and drive productivity to offset just natural cost increases that are not always easy to pass along in the form of price increases of product. So what we tend to do is really introduce new products that have features and benefits that allow us to extract higher margins to offset product lifecycle management of older products. And again, I want to be very clear, it depends on where that product is going. We see certain types of renovation as being somewhat lower margin profile than our average due to just simply the nature of that business. New construction tends to consume a much broader portfolio of product and a broader capability of lighting controls the way we would sell it. So...","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So is it fair to say something less than 50% of this $15 million is what you would expect the -- the flow-through to the bottom line? Is that a reasonable kind of outlook? I know it can move. And depending on what happens with mix and whatnot -- but is that a reasonable way to look at it?","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes. Again, I think that we are comfortable in saying that our expectation on a go-forward basis, at least for the reasonable future, after the acquisitions of Adura and eldoLED, that fixed SD&A portion is going to be in that $93 million to $95 million range. Again, there is some variability there, and that for us takes into account the puts and takes of our streamlining efforts, as well as potential cost increases for these other items that we noted.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And just as my follow-up, Vern, is this -- the comments in your release and then your comments on the call, it just seems like you're a little more constructive on the environment out there, industry-wide in terms of activity. That's kind of my readthrough from your comments and what's in your beliefs. Is that -- I mean, is that true? I just want to make sure that I'm interpreting this correctly, because it seems like versus prior quarters, we then -- a little more cautious, and I'm not saying that you're not keeping an eye on things and cognizant of an environment that could continue to be somewhat choppy, but it seems like it's a little less so now versus prior quarters. Is that the right interpretation?","Vernon J. Nagel","Sure. A couple things on that. We are not economists. So first and foremost, we believe that the activities or the information that we receive from multiple sources suggest that the growth rate for the lighting space will kind of be mid-single digits for the balance of 2013, calendar 2013, and into calendar 2014. We look at other indicators that, for us, have a historical basis, such as Architecture Billings Index, employment, absorption, lending standards. All of those leading indicators for us right now are flashing green. So my cautious optimism around this is because when those types of leading indicators have turned green, traditionally, that means positive things happen. We do believe that this economy, the GDP in North America -- or excuse me, in the U.S., is starting to improve slowly. But all of the signs suggests positive opportunities over the next handful of years for new construction-type growth. You couple that with the renovation activities that are going on and you're seeing Acuity really learning how to fish in 2 ponds. One, its traditional strength of new construction, now renovation, which is -- which we are aggressively going after and having success there. So what I feel is that -- forget one quarter to the next, but if you look out over the next handful of years, pretty robust opportunity for Acuity to leverage what it does and does so well. And yes, I do have a degree of optimism that over the next 3 to 5 years, we're going to see good growth in the markets that we serve. And it certainly is an improving condition compared with just 2 short years ago.","Operator","Our next question comes from Winnie Clark from UBS.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question. Again, your top line outperformance versus the industry was really impressive again this quarter. Did you benefit to a similar degree in the quarter from the flow-through of delayed spending? And basically, what I'm trying to understand is what level of outperformance is sustainable going forward?","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, I can't comment on your latter comment, but I can say that we believe that this quarter reflects the ability of Acuity to penetrate and provide value to the renovation market, as well as small and medium kinds of projects that are in new construction. I believe in our first quarter, we had some carryover into the second quarter as people were waiting to see what was going to happen with taxation, all of those issues that occurred back then. I believe there was delay then. I don't believe that there is delay now. I think that this is business as usual, and it's Acuity outperforming the markets that it serves because it's taking share and because it's providing serious value-added solutions to customers, reflecting our ability to tailor solutions that make sense for them. Again, renovation, both large projects, medium projects and small projects, for us, have now -- are probably half of our business, we guesstimate. But those larger projects tend to carry a lower average or a lower margin profile compared with our average.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Should we think about margins going forward as maybe you're not going to see, given the change in the mix business, at least in the near term, the type of leverage that you have historically been able to demonstrate in your business, based on these types of sales growth?","Vernon J. Nagel","That's a very good question, and I would say that this quarter is probably reflective given the current mix of our business, of the type of margin profile that we would see going forward. So I think that is a shorter-term phenomenon. I don't have a timeframe around that. On a more medium-term phenomenon, as I said earlier, as new construction becomes, again, a larger portion of our overall mix, I expect top line to grow. I expect that -- the mix of business to improve, allowing us to expand our -- both our gross profit margin, as well as our operating profit margin capability. And I would expect us to see leverage on our SD&A fixed cost.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","So given the comments of the current mix profile sustainable for the near foreseeable future, would your expectation be to -- you'd be able to hold gross margin flat next year?","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, we don't give guidance, Chris, so you know that. But our expectation is, is that if mix stays as it is, then the margin profile probably stays relatively consistent. If one believes that new construction, and we do, will start to improve and we'll see more benefits around that. What we've said earlier is that we would expect our margins to show improvement. So right now, and we want to be clear about this. This mix profile that we have today, I think is yielding this type of margin profile. If it stays like that, we would expect it to stay like that for a while.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And then LED doubled year-over-year. Clearly, we've hit some price point triggers. How do you think about keeping more of the LED component cost decreases?","Vernon J. Nagel","Two things. One, it more than doubled. It just didn't double, which is important. And we believe that the LED fixtures and luminaires that we sell today are actually -- we would expect margin percentage improvement as we come closer and closer to parity with conventional -- the cost of conventional lighting components. So in other words, the cost per lumen, as it becomes more and more in parity with LED versus conventional, we would expect the margin profile to actually be higher because that luminaire now has a lot of intelligence embedded into it that can be paid for through significant energy savings as part of a holistic lighting system. It's not just turning it on and turning it off. It's how you can now manage it and tie it in electronically with software, with nLight, into a more holistic integrated lighting solution. So I would say, Chris, that our expectation is, is that as we sell more and more of those solutions, not just individual LED luminaires, we'll see the benefit of that. But again, remember our growth in LED mirrors a lot of this renovation activity, whereas LED-based luminaire is going into renovation because they're easy to install, they're fantastic. They're not glare bombs like some of our competitors sell. These are fantastic fixtures that are doing very well. It's just that they're competitively priced.","Richard K. Reece","Okay. Just to add on -- probably add on a little bit to Vern's comment because it does tie back, Chris, to your previous comments on gross margins going forward, I think there are 2 components to these LED products -- margins going forward that could benefit us. One, as Vern commented on, is the possibility of being able to extract higher margins even when we get parity because of the value add that is there. And are we able to not have to pass on dollar-for-dollar the cost reductions? But the second is even if we pass on dollar-for-dollar, the cost reductions we see in the component costs, as Vern mentioned, the margin percentage would benefit because now you're making the same margin dollars over a smaller sales price. So therefore, obviously, the math would say the percentage is higher. So as LED continues to grow, even if we aren't able to keep for ourselves some of the lower cost reductions and components and had to pass it all along, we would still see margin percentage benefits. And then we do believe we'll be able to retain some of that because of the value add, the longer life, the controllability, all of the value proposition that LED brings that would enable the industry, hopefully, to be able to extract a higher-margin dollar as well. So there's 2 dynamics there that should help going forward on LED luminaires, as well as our overall margin as LED becomes a greater percentage of our sales. The last thing I'd mention is we are expecting, as we sell more LEDs, to sell more controls. It's a very controllable light source. It's one that people do want to dim, as Vern talked about, with the eldoLED acquisition and some of the other activities, the color changing, tunable light, all of these kind of features bring even greater opportunity and greater margin to sell that holistic solution and system instead of discreet devices. So there's a lot of dynamics going on there. Trying to pick the time and the exact amplitude of each of them obviously is impossible, but a lot of things that we find encouraging relative to our gross margins as this plays out.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just one final clarification. When you say price parity for LED, I assume that's relative to the higher value that the LEDs can bring.","Vernon J. Nagel","Price parity, yes. It's really a cost parity between light sources. So the cost per lumen of conventional lighting versus the cost per lumen of an LED. Once those components become parity, the cost -- we believe that the LED luminaire will sell for a premium compared to its conventional counterpart because of the ability to add more value paid for typically through energy savings because of how it ties into a building management capability.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will, over the longer term, deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","I would now like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you. Good morning. With me today to discuss our second quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risk and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will be happy to answer your questions.","First off our results for the second quarter of 2015 were simply outstanding. Our net sales grew almost 13%, while our adjusted earnings per share grew 44%. Net sales and our adjusted results for operating profit, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share were all second quarter records for Acuity.","In addition, this was the eighth quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth. We believe these results are yet again strong evidence of our strategies to provide customers with differentiated, value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to further extend our leadership position in North America.","These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy efficient lighting solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity.","Our adjusted profitability for the second quarter was a record for Acuity, even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth and in areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and lighting controls portfolio as well as our pursuit to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the internet of things.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.","Net sales for the second quarter were $616 million, an increase of almost 13% compared with the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of 2015 was $78.7 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $58.2 million in the year ago period.","There were minor adjustments in both periods. I find it helpful to add back these small adjustments to both quarters' results to make them comparable.","Adjusted operating profit margin for this quarter was a robust 12.8%, up 210 basis points from the adjusted margin reported in the year ago period.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share were second quarter record of a $1.8 compared with adjusted diluted earnings per share $0.75 in the year ago period, up 44%. Strong quarterly results indeed.","Lastly as Ricky will discuss later, we meaningfully enhanced our already strong financial position this quarter as we now have more than $600 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, far exceeding our debt of slightly more than $350 million.","These results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis.","While net sales for the second quarter grew almost 13% compared with the year ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew more than 15%. This growth was partially offset almost equally by lower price mix and the impact of foreign currency.","While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes, we believe that difference was primarily due to lower pricing on like-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain LED component cost.","Additionally, our sales volume was impacted by harsh weather conditions in certain parts of the U.S. as well as later issues at certain ports of the West Coast.","While it is impossible to precisely quantify the impact of these events on our results, we guess that the combined impact these items negatively impacted our shipments in the quarter by one to two percentage points.","Increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines, including sales of certain specialty fixtures as well as certain control solutions more closely associated with new construction as this important market continues to expand.","From a channel perspective, we continue to experience strong growth in commercial, industrial, infrastructure as well as gains in home improvement.","Our sales growth this quarter was primarily due to our continued focus on projects for new construction and renovation in both non-residential and residential markets as well as continued emphasis on selling higher value-added lighting solutions especially LED luminaires, where sales of our LED products grew by 60% this quarter compared with the year ago period.","An extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for 42% of our total sales.","We believe our rate of growth for LED luminaires continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, demonstrating our market-leading prowess.","Excluding LED luminaires and components, we believe the puts and takes for product pricing were again fairly benign this quarter, while overall material and component costs were slightly positive.","Looking at market conditions for the second quarter, we believe the North American lighting market was up mid-single digits during the quarter. This is in contrast with the growth rate of our net sales in North America, which was up more than 15%.","Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter.","As we noted earlier, our adjusted second-quarter operating profit was $78.7 million, a robust 12.8% of net sales, up 210 basis points from the adjusted margin reported in the year ago period.","Our gross profit margin for the quarter was 41.5%, up 210 basis points compared with the year ago quarter. The expansion of our gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales, productivity improvements and lower material cost, partially offset by price mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.","Next, adjusted total selling, distribution and administrative expenses were up $20 million or almost 13% similar to the increase in net sales.","Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales this quarter were flat compared with the prior year at 28.7%. The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher commission cost to support the increase in net sales and higher employee related costs, including incentive compensation partially offset by productivity gains.","This point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our second quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin for adjusted operating profit and increase in net sales. In doing so, one can see our variable contribution on the incremental sales of $70 million was almost 30%. All-in-all, we had another great quarter.","On the strategic front, we continue to make great strides setting the stage for what we believe will be a strong growth and profitability for the balance of 2015 and beyond.","From a product line solutions development perspective, we continued our rapid pace of new introductions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions.","As we had noted in the past, we offer customers more than $1.7 million SKUs to choose from, more than three times as many as we had 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our lighting controls and solid-state product offering.","For the second quarter, our LED sales grew 60% compared with year ago period. This is an extraordinary achievement when you consider that if one were to measure the sales of our LED products as a standalone company, we believe it would be the fourth largest lighting luminaire company in North America.","We continued to invest and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy. The purpose of the strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse portfolio by offering customer solutions that best meet their needs whether it would be a single device or a complete holistic integrated lighting solution for the indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise and security from Acuity that you are in good hands and we have your back. This is a compelling and powerful value proposition for our customers.","Sales information for our tiered solutions is still in precise and expanding off a small base, we believe our sales growth over 50% year-over-year in these categories. To fully execute this strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources along each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' applications.","More impressively, our adjusted operating profit margin continued to expand this quarter compared with the year ago period, while sales of LED-based solutions have become an even larger portion of our overall business.","Acuity is a clear leader in providing customers with superior lighting solutions, incorporating either conventional or solid-state light sources. The market has come to understand that LED as a light source is no longer a new technology. Now widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits including its energy-saving characteristics and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform for the Internet of things.","Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of LED through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application. We believe we are growing significantly faster than the markets we serve.","As I have noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during eras of technology disruption and that is even more true today.","As part of our tiered solutions strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. We are leveraging our deep customer knowledge, our unmatched access to market in a broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor solid-state and traditional energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls to bring truly differentiated value to customers, and we are delivering profitable growth and strong financial returns for our shareholders while making these important investments, including acquisitions and strategic alliances to broaden our capabilities to serve customers.","As such, we are pleased to announce this quarter, the potential acquisition of Distech Controls as well as a strategic partnership with Sensity Systems, both of which have helped drive our tiered solutions strategy, particularly as it relates to our holistic approach towards the advancements of smart buildings and smart cities.","Just a quick comment in both opportunities, Distech based outside Montr\u00e9al, Canada, is a leading provider of building automation and energy management solutions that allow for the seamless integration of lighting, HVAC, access control, closed-circuit television and related systems.","Combination of Distech and Acuity with our broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions should contribute to our tiered solutions strategy, offer true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building for enhanced occupant experience, quality visual environment, seamless operational energy efficiency, operational cost reductions and increased digital functionality.","Distech, while relatively small today with annual sales of approximately CA$70 million, would enhance our tiered solution strategy going forward as we enable smart buildings.","We hope this transaction which is subject to Distech shareholders' approval as well as other customary closing conditions, will close before the end of our fiscal year. We will have more to say about this once the transaction is complete.","Our strategic partnership with Sensity, a pioneer in light sensory networks will allow us to deliver smart lighting solutions to cities, commercial and retail facilities, airports and universities, focused on improving energy conservation, public services, safety and security and a wide variety of other applications.","Additionally, our joint solutions will further transform energy-efficient LED lighting into smart connected platforms for the industrial Internet of things. Strategic opportunities such as these coupled with our internal effort should allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new commercial construction cycle.","We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication resolve over more than 7,000 associate by maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers.","I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for construction market later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few final comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2015. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern. Good morning, everyone. Vern recovered the primary drivers for our second quarter sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items.","I will provide a bit more color on our quarter's results and financial position as well as our recently announced potential acquisition of Distech.","I will begin my prepared comments by providing a brief update on streamlining activities. We recorded a modest $0.6 million favorable adjustment to the special charge due to the lower than anticipated employee related severance costs.","We currently expect to incur production transfer expenses and additional costs associated with the streamlining actions totaling approximately $1.4 million during the second half of fiscal 2015. This will result in a total charge for the fiscal year of approximately $11 million.","We still expect to achieve annual savings in excess of the total estimated charge cost, but as we mentioned last quarter, we plan to reinvest a portion of these savings in additional growth initiatives which will require adding a new talent with different skill sets. Accordingly, in fiscal year 2015, we expect to realize savings net of reinvestments approximately equal to the amount of the total streamlining cost.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.4% compared with 35% in the second quarter of last year. As we indicated last quarter, we received a slight benefit in the second quarter, due primarily to the retroactive application of the U.S. research and development tax credit, which became law during the second quarter with the passage of the tax extenders.","We still expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","As Vern mentioned earlier, cash flow generated from operations for the first half of fiscal year 2015 was an impressive $75.5 million, which is an $18.1 million increase over the prior year.","Our operating working capital defined as accounts receivable plus inventory, less accounts payable decreased five days year-over-year to an industry-leading 41 days and represents only about 12% of annualized revenue. Much of this year-over-year improvement was in our management of inventory where we continue to improve our inventory turns while also improving our service levels.","In the first half of fiscal year 2015, we spent $27 million on capital expenditures compared with $16.5 million in the prior year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2015.","This expected uptick in capital expenditures compared with recent prior years is primarily due to projects that we delay from fiscal year 2014 and investments necessary to support our growth, including the build-out of our innovation and technology center here in metro Atlanta.","At February 28, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents balance of $601.1 million, an increase of $48.6 million since August 31, 2014. Our total debt was $354 million. Consequently, our cash exceeded debt at the end of the fiscal quarter.","At February 28, 2015, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million under our credit facility. We clearly have significant financial strength and flexibility and we will continue to seek the best use of our strong cast generation to enhance shareholder value.","I will conclude with some additional comments on the proposed Distech acquisition. As Vern mentioned earlier, on March 9th, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Distech. The terms of the agreement reflect a cash purchase price totaling CA$318 million or approximately U.S. $250 million, which we intend to fund using cash on hand.","The closing of this proposed transaction is subject to approval by certain Distech shareholders and other closing conditions. If we are able to successfully conclude these remaining conditions, we would expect to close in the next several months.","Because of significant volatility in the U.S. and Canadian dollar exchange rate over the last year or so, we thought it prudent to enter into a foreign currency forward contract in an effort to mitigate nearly all of the foreign currency exposure associated with the Canadian dollar purchase price, because U.S. GAAP does not allow a hedge of a commitment to acquire our business to receive hedge accounting treatment, any gain or loss incurred on the ultimate settlement of the forward contract, which is based on market exchange rates at the settlement date of the forward contract will be recognized in the income statement.","Distech generated net sales in excess of CA$70 million during calendar year 2014 and enjoyed a five-year annual growth rate of over 25%. Almost half of Distech sales are in the U.S., about a third in Europe, less than 10% in Canada, and the remaining spread broadly around the rest of the world.","The operating profit margin of Distech is similar to Acuity. We will provide additional details following the completion of the transaction. Thank you and I will now turn the call back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving, particularly for Acuity. Our growth expectations for the lighting industry, primarily in North America has not really changed much over the last several quarters, we remain very positive, so while we do not give earnings guidance, I would like to provide you with some observations for the balance of 2015.","First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest, but increasing pace. Our forecast for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely. The consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North America is expected to grow in the mid to upper single-digit range throughout fiscal 2015, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity.","Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve and our business. Leading indicators for the North American market such as architectural billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption and lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve while residential construction continues to grow nicely.","As has become the norm over the last handful of years, we are always leery of the next round of uncertainty that might come out of Washington as well as physical and foreign policy issues. As you know, the manner in how these key issues are handled can meaningfully business and consumer confidence.","Nonetheless, we continue to expect that the overall demand in our end markets for 2015 continue to improve and be more broad-based and consistent than that experienced in either 2013 or 2014. The continued favorable trends in our March order rate, again seems to support continuing level of improvement.","Second, excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input cost for the balance of 2015 as some commodity costs have waned while others continue to rise.","Further, we expected employee related cost to continue to rise primarily due to wage inflation, higher incentive compensation and the negative impact of rising healthcare cost.","Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are impossible to predict. Of course, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture as well as furthering our efforts to drive productivity improvements.","Another observation, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales value priced product and sales channel mix and innovation, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volume grows, particularly for larger new construction projects which should also benefit our mix, particularly as we execute our tiered solution sales strategy and as we continue to realize gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","Our gross profit margin improvement in the second quarter was a good example of our potential, but we prefer to look at our margin improvement over a 12-month period to remove quarterly anomalies, like the impact of harsh weather conditions or the seasonality of the second quarter in general. To discern proper trends, you should do the same as a positive picture.","Additionally, while we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly and most importantly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the introduction holistic lighting solutions that for example connect smart lighting to smartphones for retailers as well as our growing electronic component capabilities.","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, while our strategy is to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy is really next step in the advancement of our overall growth strategy.","Additionally, we continue to see opportunities in this environment, including benefits from growing portions of the market, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels and growth from the introduction of new lighting solutions.","Our positive results reflect the solid execution of these strategies by our associates. Our companywide strategy is straightforward, expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence in our considerable financial strength and capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns.","Sunoptics [ph] focus and resources, we are realigning our resources and continuing to make additional investments in certain areas today, because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our record growth supports this view.","As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry along with the broader electrical industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of things.","We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of broader lighting and electrical industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years providing us with significant growth potential.","As the North American market leader, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you. With that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from Matt McCall from BB&T.","Matt McCall","Thanks, good morning, guys.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Matt McCall","Vern, in the past, you have been helpful in giving us an idea of what the addressable market looks like over the next three to five years.","Can you talk about how Distech and the exposure to that, I guess, what amounts to be a new tier in your tiered solution strategy? ","What it does to that addressable market and how it changes your outlook over that three-year to five-year period?","Vern Nagel","Sure. Matt that is a great question. First of all, Distech participates in the building energy management system market that is roughly, what, a $6 billion market, Ricky, growing at probably second half or 8% per annum, so they themselves are participating in a very interesting, if you will portion of the broader electrical market and showing exceptional growth as Ricky reported.","We see the opportunity to not only participate, if you will, in that broader electrical market, but to see the convergence of our key customers sets to bring unique capabilities that as we said can provide sort of end-to-end type energy management occupant comfort, visual environment, so we see the opportunity to actually be accretive to the overall market growth by bringing these two businesses together and again it's a global business. They have a global shareholder platform, so just working through the mechanics of closing the transaction.","Again, our guess is that completed sometime before the end of our fiscal year, so we are not really giving, if you will, additional earnings guidance for 2015 until the transaction is complete, but we are very bullish about the combination of the two business.","Matt McCall","Okay. Perfect. Thank you. Then I guess my second question, another strong contribution margin this quarter. The comps seemed to get a lot easier if I look at my model correctly in the back of last year, especially in Q3.","Is there anything we need to keep in mind that would make us not assume that the incremental is thus stronger than what you have been running in the back half of this year?","Vern Nagel","Let me think about your comment. You said the comps get easier. Let me think about that. We grow by double digits for the last eight quarters in a row.","Matt McCall","I am sorry. Let me clarify, Vern. The incremental margin comps, so in the first half of last year according to my model, you did about a 20% incremental margin of 17%. Back half it goes to 9% and 14%, so you have been running 30% on those, what amount to be tougher comps on the incremental side, with your incrementals getting easier, should your variable margin thus increase from the 30% range or is there something else to keep in mind?","Vern Nagel","Matt, I am just giving you a little bit of a hard time. ","Matt McCall","That is okay.","Vern Nagel","Our variable contribution margins in the second half of last year were impacted by the increase in incentive compensation. This year we are performing at a very high level, so the incentive compensation should be at or slightly above where it was last year, so therefore it should have a de minimis impact, if you will, on the contribution rates that we will experience this year, which we would expect to be higher than what they were last year.","Again, through the first half, our variable contribution margin rate has been very robust. When you think about your models, we are investing in our business, we are investing in people, skill sets and technology, so we continue to be more comfortable with a variable contribution margin that is kind of mid to upper 20s, but again we are trying to deliver nickel and every dime we can to the bottom-line for our shareholders.","I am very, very pleased with the teams drive around productivity not just in terms of our supply chain, but throughout our organization and you saw the benefit of that this quarter. Our gross profit margin was up by 210 basis points over the year ago period. While we continue to invest in people and skills and capabilities, to really pursue our tiered solution strategy, particularly tiers, two, three and four, which we think provide great growth opportunities over the next decade.","Matt McCall","Perfect. Thank you, Vern.","Operator","The next question is from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks, good morning everybody.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn","Just wondering if you could provide an update on how the market for Lumicast seems to be developing?","Vern Nagel","Sure. As people would recall, Lumicast is our visual internal light system for both retailers and other spaces, so visual light guide system. That capability and customer response to it continues to be very favorable. We are past certain test data sites with certain customers and we are now moving to a broader platform and broader capability, so we are very excited about what its future can mean, and we will provide more detail on that as those opportunities continue to rollout, but we think that there will be a contributory part of our growth rates on a go forward basis.","Christopher Glynn","Great. As you do lots of different things to further lighting's role in Internet of things and your tiered solutions and if we take the Sensity partnership, conceptually, could we go into a little bit more detail how that fills in gaps around, say, what a Distech and Lumicast get you?","Vern Nagel","Sure. I think, Sensity, again, the strategic partnership there is a great opportunity for both Acuity and Sensity to combine their disparate, but consolidated skills to bring great value to cities, to people that operate large malls. Their capability coupled with our luminaires and our control systems combined will allow us to provide a great deal of incremental opportunities for the end-user.","If you think about President Obama came out and has an initiative, I believe, Ricky it is $1.5 million street lights?","Ricky Reece","Right.","Vern Nagel","To renovate those and when you think about wherever there is people, there is light, so here's an opportunity to take advantage of the electronic aspects of LED both, from Acuity and Sensity to now collect information and data that can be used for security, safety, traffic patterns, all sorts of information where this data can be collected and then manipulated through apps and provide real-time opportunities with those, so think about parking structures, think about streets and cities and traffic patterns and weather patterns and so on and so forth. That kind of information can be collected from these types of polls, if you will, because of both, Sensity and Acuity's capability to really provide unique value.","Ricky Reece","I would just highlight Chris that Sensity is predominantly outdoor, focused on the smart city, the applications that Vern was describing Distech is obviously a much more indoor. We did have an offering and do have an offering in ROAM. ROAM is still acceptable of technology for certain outdoor monitoring of lights, but Sensity brings a much greater bandwidth and capability to expand our participation in this move to smart city in the outdoor space.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. Thank you, guys.","Operator","The next question is from Jeff Osborne from Cowen & Company.","Jeff Osborne","Great. Congratulations on the strong results. I just had two questions. One, I was wondering if you could give us a sense of perspective on the attach rate of tiered solutions within the LED sales was the question one.","Question two is just a bigger picture question on the Distech acquisition. I am trying to get a sense of where the borders or boundaries stand between what Distech would be doing and say Johnson Controls and Honeywell and Schneider Electric would be doing in terms of the future of building automation just how deeply if you look out three to five years, do you want to get into that space?","Vern Nagel","On the first question, the attachment rate of LED to our tiered solution strategy, again, overall this quarter about 43% of our revenues were LED-based luminaires. If you think about a Tier-1 solution which is really an individual devices of some type as some functionality that expanding all the way to say Tier-3 solution, which is a holistic, fully integrated capability inside a building or the outdoor application.","The growth rate that we are seeing in kind of Tier-2 and Tier-3, to be particular is now north of 50%. Our data is not exactly precise. It is coming off a small base and most of that capability, particularly in Tier-3 would be LED-based solutions. That is where we are integrating our controls platform into our luminaires and making a part of a holistic solution.","Again, very exciting for Acuity and for our customers and we will continue to drive that capability going forward. If you then think about again, visible light communication that we just spoke to think about the opportunity, all the Distech an opportunity of the Sensity coming together, allowing is not only to take advantage of Tier-3's solutions in terms of that capability in the marketplace and now offering it as a backbone to provide capability around the Internet of things and giving us the opportunity to generate revenues in the Tier-4 capability, so I think it is all very robust in what we are doing.","When we think about Distech, you know, Distech supports the industry in terms of building energy management components as well as overall solutions, so to a degree we would be a provider of capability to those folks. In addition, Acuity will be offering its [ph] solution set to building owners that will attach both, lighting HVAC building management into a more holistic approach to allow these folks a more simple, more elegant solution to managing their facilities as well as the combination of these two businesses to really get after collecting information throughout the building and facilitating that information flow into the Internet of things to now provide that data back in real usable ways back to the building owner.","Think about our visible light communication capability in the retail space just as an example. That is a huge opportunity going forward. If you tie that into the building management side, it can provide more information to the building owner, so we are very excited about not only the opportunity to support those that are in the industry today, but to create our own value proposition around key verticals and key customer sets where we think we can provide a unique value.","Jeff Osborne","Great. Appreciate the detail. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray.","Mike Ritzenthaler","Good morning. Another question on Distech and the partnership with Sensity, I just wanted to get some additional perspective on Acuity's growing presence there and controls if there is a way to quantify where software and controls are now versus where they could be in one to two years, how accretive the margins - could those initiatives be?","It does not sound like, I guess this one is a little bit more for Ricky, it does not sound like Distech will add any sort of FX complexity other than sort of the hedging program on the purchase price.","Vern Nagel","Let me attempt on your first question. Unfortunately, you are probably not going to like the answer. We have hypothesis around how controls and solutions will come together in a Tier-3 and Tier-4 opportunity and Distech and Sensity are all part of, if you will, offering that capability in Tier-3 and Tier-4 enhancing it.","For me it is a bit of a blank sheet of a paper. It is coming together. We think that the world really, they always have a first cost person thinking of an individual component, no issue. We want to continue to really drive capability there, but more and more, and just think about in your own personal life, a phone decade ago was just a phone, because technology has advanced, because micro processing and all of that stuff has advanced.","Your phone now does so many more things and it is really based on software and capability. We believe that we will see that kind of trajectory in our space and to be able to provide customers with those types of solutions both Tier-3 is the backbone, and then providing additional capabilities that in a Tier-4 world, because that backbone is robust.","To say that, today, it will be this size or that size, I think, is a bit of a challenge. We are trying to really get our data more precise and that is why we said earlier, we are coming off a small base, our data is not exactly precise yet, but we will start to report out the kinds of growth rates that we will see in our various Tiers to help answer that question more possibly in the future.","Ricky Reece","On the FX question, Mike, yes, it actually will help us a little bit. As I mentioned, the sales of Distech into Canada is less than 10% of their total revenue. Approximately half of it into U.S., but yet they do have a pretty large presence in the Montr\u00e9al area of Canada. They also have a presence in Europe, so today we are very long the Canadian dollars as we sell into there, but do not have any production and so forth.","Now they will help to some degree balance that out as we have a bigger cost base and their base will overshadow the revenue base there, so it will provide us a little bit more of a natural hedge into Canada. Again, not a huge impact in the whole scheme of things, but it will be slightly favorable to managing the fluctuation between the Canadian dollar and the U.S. as it provides a bit of a natural hedge.","Mike Ritzenthaler","I appreciate your answers on both of those. I am curious about, on the investment side on investing in growth and how that manifests in the P&L over the coming 12 months or so?","Vern Nagel","Vernon, I think you mentioned that ongoing pruning has already been partly reinvested, so that is going to continue. Is Acuity temporarily over earning a little as costs are pruned out before investments are made and will future investments in the next couple, say, 12 months be step-wise or smooth? In terms of expectations, how should that manifest in the P&L?","Vern Nagel","Sure. That is a great question. Two responses to it, one, the way to get at your question is really to think about our variable contribution margin rate. Through the first half, again, very favorable, due lots of things internally. We are investing in people at a fairly aggressive rate, so you are seeing, if you will, both, investment and you are seeing our productivity improvements as well as value gain and it is manifesting itself in a variable contribution margin that is in that kind of upper 20s.","We said that we are comfortable in mid-to-upper 20s, so I think that is the way to really think about our business going forward. Each quarter, quarter-to-quarter, you are going to have some anomalies in there, but for the most part, we think that we are on a pretty good trajectory to talk about variable contribution margins in the mid-to-upper 20% range.","Mike Ritzenthaler","Fair enough. Thank you very much.","Operator","The next question is from Ryan Merkel from William Blair.","Ryan Merkel","Thanks. You know, when you look at your recent order trends, do you see a mix towards new non-res construction? Then sort of secondly, are you still thinking that new non-res can improve in the second half of this year?","Vern Nagel","We do believe that new non-residential construction will improve in the balance of the year and well into the next couple of years. I think all the trends that we articulated earlier, employment, availability, absorption, just availability of credit, all of these things I think bodes very well for the new construction forecast that whether it would be Dodge or Global Insights [ph] any of these organizations, we think that there is a groundswell facts that support that longer-term contention of growth, so we do see that.","We expect to fully participate in that growth. We are very good at new construction, but I would also say we are very good at the renovation side of the world. We have learned how to fish in that pond, and we continue to play there and play there well, so that is why I believe we can continue to outperform the growth rates of markets we serve because of our diversification into those markets, balance and the strength of our portfolio and our access to market.","Ryan Merkel","Then my second question, I get the sense that large national industrial distributors are investing in lighting in a bigger way, hiring many more people, adding more products.","Are you seeing this as well? Are you adding more distributors to your network? Then, do you think this trend could help add to growth in the future?","Vern Nagel","We are not adding more to distribution. We are investing heavily in our key strategic distributor partners to help them grow in the lighting space.","We see lighting both, for new construction and renovation as a huge opportunity for them and us. We are picking and choosing those partners to help really drive growth by capturing more share in both, new construction and renovation, so that is where we have been.","Again, another area of significant investment for us is our relationships with our key strategic partners, and yes, we are seeing them investment and we are encouraging their investment and we are working with them to new hone train their people and to understand how to sell the benefits of lighting a longer tiered solution approach.","Ryan Merkel","Great. Thank you.","Ricky Reece","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Weiss from Baird.","Tim Weiss","Hey, guys. Nice job. I guess, just to go back to the end markets, something that we have seen in some of the data that you referenced, and just anecdotally as we are starting to see an improvement in K-12s and the hospital markets.","I guess, could you talk specifically about maybe what you are seeing in quoting activity and bidding activity in those two specific end markets? Then how we should think? Could you just remind us about how important those are to Acuity from a revenue perspective?","Vern Nagel","Sure. Those markets have really been quite soft for the last two to three years. In fact, you have seen declines in those markets. You are now starting to see improvements, so the rate of decline has stopped. You are now starting to see a little bit of growth, and understand K-12 and hospital have obviously very different dynamics, but in the K-12 world, it is very dependent on the state governments and their budgets and tax revenues so and so forth, so it is kind of.","As employment improves, you are seeing more taxes come into the state and local municipalities, the population continues to grow, so the need for K-12 schools, whether they are existing and they need to be updated or new, is a growing opportunity. We do well in the K-12 world, because we just have the portfolio, we have the access to market, we are very, very skilled at doing that, so it is an important market. It will contribute to our growth on a go forward basis.","Similarly for healthcare, healthcare I think much of that industry and you know more about this than I will, has been in a kind of a status quo pattern trying to understand what does Obamacare mean and so and so forth.","I believe that has the demographics of our population continue to evolve. You just need more physical capacity to be able to handle the aging population.","Again, we have made investments in our past, healthcare lighting for example to have and in patient room. We do very well in hospitals. I do not know the exact percentage of what hospitals represent to the whole market. We have that data. I just do not have it off the top of my head. It too was an important part of our growth on a go forward basis.","Tim Weiss","That is helpful, yes, because really that has been a piece of the non-res market that has been very sluggish, so it is good to hear that that is starting to turn.","Then I guess a clarification, you called out that the 1% to 2% impact to shipments from weather and port, I just want to clarify that shipment, so really have you seen an impact? Has that helped? Have you seen that kind of reverse in March as some of that has kind of normalized I guess?","Ricky Reece","From a weather perspective, unfortunately, I hate to use the analogy, but it is like pushing snow. You just move aside and go. Just kind of put down, it is rare that you recapture that sale to a very small degree and certain projects you may, but if you are person living in an area that was impacted by weather, let's call it the New England area and you are going to doing in home improvement is simply you delayed it and then you never existed another day, so you did recapture days with revenues.","On the port side, again, the problem there is that the slowdowns have occurred, so you now trying to get your product out to your various customers set and it did have an impact on us. It had an impacted in two areas, one in shipments, but also we incurred the fair bit of expediting cost to help meet our customers' demands in some of these areas, so here is almost the force majeure kind of situation and yet we are experiencing incremental cost.","We have spent a lot of time trying to quantify what that was, but the 1% to 2% in top-line that is a reasonable estimate for the impact, but no. I do not think you capture that back.","If you recall last year second quarter, we had similarly difficult weather conditions and it was our expectation that we would see the uptick for that in the third quarter and yet we do not believe that we did, so we are not expecting that to happen here.","Tim Weiss","Great. I appreciate the color, guys. Thanks.","Operator","The next question is from Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord Genuity.","Jed Dorsheimer","Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Just one, Vern, I guess if we take a look at the tiered solution and sort of where you are going with or what seems to be the direction with the recent acquisitions most notably Distech, from a controls perspective in the total solution, and we look at that percentage of sort of a Tier-3 as a percentage of your total sales, am I looking at this wrong that it seems very similar to where we were probably four years ago with respect to LED as a percentage of your sales and yet it would seem that the competitive landscape for a tiered or a total, including control solution or a value-added solution seems to be more favorable for you than what you faced from an LED perspective versus traditional lighting? Am I missing something there or would you agree or what would you note are the differences?","Vern Nagel","Sure. First of all, we look forward to Distech becoming part of the family, but that is still a little ways off. We hope to complete it again before the end of our fiscal, to really take advantage that, but Distech and our strategy around say Tier-3 or a holistic solutions approach to a building owner, is we think will be very powerful.","Again, as technology comes in, as controls become more and more embedded into the luminaire as software becomes more of a facilitator how people will use their space, I think that your analogy is right, so we are betting and investing, maybe not betting, but investing heavily to deliver a comprehensive Tier-2, Tier-3 and then that will enable a Tier-4 opportunity on a go forward basis.","I mean, I do not know what the percentage could be, but it is going to be significant, because again people will want to take advantage of a holistic system and will be less enamored about having just a single device that may not tie well into the overall, if you will, building energy management, lighting environment-type system, so our feeling strongly is that we will continue to see proliferation and really demand from the industry around these types of solutions, particularly in key verticals like office buildings and healthcare facilities and universities and retail spaces. It is just very excited, but we are in the early innings of all this.","Ricky Reece","One comment though I would may Jed, it is while I agree with Vern, that there is a lot of similarities to the LED transformation and all, one difference is Distech and HVAC is the channels, the lighting and all was as we moved LED was a similar channel. There will be a need to manage and reconcile the HVAC, the controls that Distech have tended to go through a different channel than the lighting. That is blurring emerging together as well as clearly their channel or building controls or including lighting controls and our lighting control channel partners are getting into building, so that is coming together but I would just note a little bit of a difference in this move versus the transformation to LED.","Vern Nagel","Ricky, that is a great point, because both of those channels and those channel partners will continue to expand their capabilities and have great growth. It will be around certain customers' sets that you will see this combinations and this capability that will occur first, but we think that this is a migration. This is not something that is going to happen immediately overnight, but I do believe that both, Distech's channel partners as well as Acuity's channel partners will continue to experience strong growth in Tier-2 and Tier-3 whether the combination of the value proposition, it will be how that customer wants to be served I think drives that, but we see growth continuing in both channels and fairly aggressive growth.","Jed Dorsheimer","Great. That is helpful. That is all for me. Thanks, guys.","Vern Nagel","Thanks, Jed.","Operator","The next question is from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities","Rich Kwas","Hi. Good morning. Just a question back on the incremental margin, as we think about the back half of the year, I know this was asked earlier, but if the $11 million is going to be the number that is net that is a little bit better than I would have expected. I would have thought there have been a little more reinvestment, so Vern I am getting a sense that you are pretty comfortable with the mid-to-high 20s incremental, but it sounds like sensibly [ph] that could be end up being conservative. Am I off base with my thinking?","Vern Nagel","Well, again, we do not give forecast. I would refer us all back to sort of that mid-to-upper 20s, we work hard every day to drive higher incremental margins, but we are investing in our business I mean to really capture the opportunity of Tier-3 and Tier-4, we are adding skills sets and capabilities to our business.","Yes, the question earlier, we have made decisions, streamline actions, to say we are going to disinvest here and we are going to reinvest over here that process is going on, went on in the first quarter, went on in the second quarter and we saw with our variable contribution margins are we expected to continue to go on, but we are looking at every opportunity to drive our incremental margins as best we can.","As I said, there is just look at one quarter, but I think as we think about the whole year that mid-to-upper 20s is a good number and it reflects investment back in the business, hopefully and hope is not a strategy, but our strategy is to really start to see improvements in our incremental margins as we get into '16 and '17, because these investments in the human capital side of our business start to pay off in terms of solutions Tier-2, Tier-3, Tier-4 to our customers that are now paying for, if you will, those investments and giving us the return. That return should be in the form of higher incremental margins within the out years of it, not in terms of 2015.","Rich Kwas","Okay. Thanks. Then second question on Distech, just two separate questions. They are somewhat intertwined. Investment, I know you have not closed a deal, but do you envision that you will have to make meaningful investments in educating the agent and distribution partner network that you have as well as the acquisitions, other partners in terms of their distribution, in terms of educating them on the holistic offering that you guys will be able to deliver going forward. How does that end up working in terms from an investment standpoint?","Then second with the meaningful presence in Europe, does this potentially give you a platform to expand your business a lot more meaningfully looking out 5 years, 7 years, 10 years in the European market?","Vern Nagel","Sure. If you look at Acuity's current access to, say, the commercial industrial market, our agency network which is the best of the best, the opportunities for us to continue to drive growth and innovation around Tier-3 approach, we are going to continue down the path that we are on right now.","Similarly, Distech Systems integrator partners, where they have robust connectivity there, what we are going to do is continue to invest in those channels, invest in the education so that they can bring value to their customers. We think that there will be some overlap where locally folks can work together, but we still have an awful lot of work to do with those channel partners to figure out what is the best and most effective value proposition for the customer who can deliver that, but to be clear, it is going to be an accretive situation.","Both channels will continue to grow because of what they do and how they are doing it and the opportunity to work together to provide a differentiated value proposition is our goal, but we have to get these folks -- other and that is why we are hopeful to close this transaction and get these people working together to figure out what is the best most effective way to do that we have hypotheses around that but we are not really ready to say here's is exactly what we are doing with that until we get those channel partners together.","Rich Kwas","Okay. Then in Europe, your thoughts on the ability to expand in Europe?","Ricky Reece","Yes. As I mentioned about a third of their revenues are in Europe they have a presence in Lyon, France. That certainly is something we can build on we do have a presence as where we have an operation in the U.K. and one in Spain, and I think there we do see opportunities.","As Vern mentioned earlier, Distech does have a global offering that meets the codes in the European Union as well as around other parts of the world Middle East, Asia and so forth and we have some of that so we will be in a good position I think as you pointed out to be patient it will be over a multiple years, but an opportunity to enhance our capabilities in Europe.","Rich Kwas","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The last question is from Sven Eenmaa from Stifel.","Sven Eenmaa","Yes. Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask in terms of, if you think about Acuity's M&A and acquisition activity over the next 12 months or so, what are the key areas of focus there?","Vern Nagel","Ricky, do you want to address?","Ricky Reece","Sure. I would put it in several buckets. First is technology. You have certainly seen us continue to invest in that and again it could be in acquisitions or it can be in alliances in certain type of a relationships as we are doing with Sensity, so technology is an area to build out to support this tiered solution having gap fillers of tuck-in bolt-on type of acquisitions both in controls as well as in the luminaire area, will continue to be a focus we have done a quite a number of those and I think it is likely to see us continue to do that.","Then thirdly would be geographic expansion and it would be in that order less of a priority, but if the right opportunities came up whether it is in Europe or in other parts of the world, we would certainly look to expand geographic or market presence and other way, so I would put it in those orders of priority.","Sven Eenmaa","Got it. The last question, I just wanted to clarify regarding the institutional markets. Are you across state digital, education, healthcare, are you seeing increased quoting activity there or are you actually seeing increased revenues currently?","Vern Nagel","Ricky?","Ricky Reece","More on the quoting side, the education season is coming upon us. They tend to do much more of their actual shipping and building in the summer months, particularly K-12. At this stage, you would expect it to be more quoting and last in the shipping area and I would say healthcare is more this stage, projects they have got architects involved doing design work and getting quotes, but several of those projects have not been released to orders yet. I think, we are seeing some pickup in the shipments in the healthcare, but it is more in the order rate.","Sven Eenmaa","Got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe, we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organizations succeed in critical areas that will over the longer-term continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders.","Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Please disconnect at this time."],"649":["Acuity Brands, Inc.

After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary. Sir, you may begin","Dan Smith","Good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2019 second quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We are webcasting today's conference call on our website at acuitybrands.com. I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, such that actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now, let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. Our results for the second quarter were very solid despite continuing inflationary cost pressures and the impact of tariffs. We implemented several actions to address these cost issues, including price increases and additional productivity improvements.","We believe our topline growth this quarter was impacted by the pull forward of orders by customers into the first quarter as they acted to avoid announced price increases. Nonetheless, we grew our topline by almost 3%.","Additionally, we improved our adjusted operating profit margins by 50 basis points over the year-ago period and delivered adjusted diluted earnings per share of $1.99, a second quarter record.","I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the second quarter of 2019.","Net sales for the second quarter were a record $854 million, an increase of almost 3% compared with the year-ago period. Reported operating profit was $95.9 million compared with $89.5 million in the year ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.67 compared with $2.33 in the year ago period.","There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain other add-backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods as Ricky will explain later in the call.","In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of 2019 was $112.4 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $105.3 million in the year ago period, an increase of 7%.","Adjusted operating profit margin was 13.2%, an increase of 50 basis points compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.99, a second quarter record, up 5% from the year-ago period.","The results in the year ago period were significantly benefited by the adoption of a new tax law as Ricky will explain. Net cash provided by operating activities was $188 million for the first half of this year, up nicely over the year ago period.","And our cash position at the end of the quarter grew to $232 million, even after we repurchased $49 million of the company's stock during the first six months of the year, leaving us with plenty of liquidity to execute our growth strategies.","Looking at some specific details for the quarter, net sales increased almost 3% over the year ago period. Overall, net sales volume grew more than 3%, while the price\/mix of products sold was unfavorable by less than 1 point this quarter as gains from recently announced price increases were more than offset primarily by changes in channel mix and to a lesser degree changes in the mix of products sold.","The small benefit of acquisitions net of divestitures was essentially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency, and the adoption of the new accounting standard ASC 606. We believe our growth in net sales this quarter was muted by the impact of customers primarily in the independent sales network channel pulling forward orders into the first quarter in advance of announced price increases.","While we noted this activity in our first quarter earnings call, we are unable to determine the precise impact of the sales shift between quarters. However, if we look at first half sales compared with the year ago period, we grew our net sales by almost 7%. Our rate of growth over this time period was far in excess of the overall growth rate of the lighting industry in North America, which we believe was up low-single digits.","We believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative, and holistic lighting and lighting controls and building management solutions as well as the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to continue to gain overall market share in North America this quarter.","Looking more closely at the details of our net sales this quarter. Net sales through our independent sales network were benefited by implemented price increases and growth from our building management team at Distech, which knocked the ball out of the park this quarter, partially offset by a decline in C&I sales volume caused by the pull-forward of customer orders into the first quarter.","Additionally, net sales in our corporate accounts channel were up 10% over the year-ago period as we continue to expand the sales of our Atrius-enabled luminaires, particularly in the retail vertical.","It is interesting to note that net sales in the C&I market, which is part of our independent sales network, were up almost 5% for the first half of 2019 compared with the year ago period. We believe measuring net sales for the first half eliminates the distortion caused by the pull forward of customer orders between quarters.","The overall growth in C&I for the first half was primarily due to greater shipments of certain high volume, more basic, lesser featured LED fixtures, primarily for applications on smaller, mid-sized commercial project, as well as the benefit from our implemented price increases.","Additionally, net sales growth in our independent sales network for lighting was somewhat muted by prolonged weak demand for larger non-residential lighting project as well as continued product substitution to lower-priced alternatives for certain lighting products.","With regard to the impact on net sales for changes in the price and mix of products sold, the overall net impact was negative by less than one point. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in the price and mix of products sold, we estimate the impact of price increases contributed low-single digits to our overall growth in the quarter.","This positive price capture was more than offset by changes in channel and product mix. The change in channel and product mix this quarter was mostly influenced by changes in channel mix and to a much lesser extent product substitutions to lower priced alternatives, primarily for more basic, lesser-featured LED luminaires sold in certain channels as well as a modest decline in shipments for larger commercial projects.","Our profitability measures for the second quarter were solid given overall market conditions.","Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $112 million, up approximately 7% compared with the year-ago period, while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 13.2%, up 50 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to a decline in both SDA expense in dollars as well as in percentage of net sales partially offset by lower adjusted gross profit margin, the dynamics of which I will explain in a moment.","Adjusted gross profit margin for the second quarter was 39.2%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared with the year-ago period. Adjusted gross profit was essentially flat between periods at $335 million as higher net sales volume, the benefit of price increases and productivity improvements were offset by higher input costs, including inbound freight and tariffs and imported Chinese-made components of finished goods, as well as changes in the customer mix within the retail channel.","This next point is very important to understand. Our adjusted gross profit and margin were negatively impacted by a shift in net sales between key customers within our retail channel. While our overall net sales or products sold through the retail channel were up 4% in the second quarter. Net sales by key customers within this channel changed significantly.","Each of our key customers in this channel have different service requirement, which impact how we account for these differences under generally accepted accounting principles. We believe the impact of this customer shift within this channel accounted for a large portion of the decline in overall adjusted gross profit margin in the second quarter compared with the year-ago period. However, it is important to note, we believe this decline was largely offset with lower SDA expense. We expect this shift between gross profit and SDA expense to continue for the foreseeable future.","Next, our adjusted SDA expenses were down approximately $7 million compared with the year-ago period. Adjusted SDA expense, as a percentage of net sales was 26% in the second quarter, a decrease of 150 basis points from the year-ago period. Again, the decline in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to lower freight and commission costs caused primarily by changes in sales channel mix, the customer shift within the retail channel as well as certain cost containment and productivity improvements partially offset by higher expenses added from recent acquisitions.","Our adjusted diluted EPS was a second quarter record of $1.99 compared with $1.89 reported in the year-ago period, an increase of 5%. The increase was primarily due to the growth in adjusted operating profit and lower average shares outstanding due to stock repurchases during the past year, all partially offset by one-time favorable impact of the new tax law enacted in the year-ago period.","If I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this past quarter. On the strategic and technology front, we continue to make significant strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth in revenue and profitability over the long-term. We continue to gain market share in many important product categories and sales channels. Our Tier 3 and 4 solutions were up over 30% again this quarter.","From a commercial perspective, we continue to accelerate the number of Atrius-enabled deployments and increased active programs with several of our largest U.S.-based retailers. Our Atrius-based IoT luminaires and solutions are becoming the industry standard in the retail segment. Additionally, we continue to expand these solutions into other verticals, as awareness by customer grows, as they come to recognize the full benefits of these solutions, including superior visual comfort and energy savings, as well as the capabilities of our IoT solutions, providing them with the opportunity to transform their spaces from nothing more than expense items into strategic assets.","As I mentioned in prior earnings calls, it is clear that certain Chinese-based lighting companies, many obviously being subsidized in some form, are influencing pricing for certain basic lesser-featured fixtures sold in certain channels. We will not yield this space for many strategic reasons. As such, we have continued to expand our Contractor Select portfolio to profitably compete in this portion of the market.","Also as I mentioned last quarter, we introduced in late 2018 the next generation of our industry-leading lighting control system, nLight AIR, a wireless control system with a wide range of options and functionality, for which there was strong customer demand this quarter. We believe Acuity has the most comprehensive and feature-rich wired and wireless lighting control system available in the non-residential market and importantly, they are connected to our growing BMS solutions. Our growth in these areas is significant.","Lastly, we initiated many actions last year to further streamline our operations to reduce costs and improve our productivity. We believe these initiatives, both enhanced our performance this quarter and will continue to benefit our operating and financial performance in the future, as well as allow us to accelerate investments in areas with higher growth opportunities. Ricky will have additional comments on this in a moment.","We have been able to create these capabilities, while providing industry-leading results, because of the dedication resolve of our many associates, who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our expectations for the balance of 2019 later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the second quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable.","In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for the second quarter and first six months of fiscal year 2019 and 2018. Adjusted results exclude the impact of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, manufacturing inefficiencies directly related to the closure of a facility, acquisition-related items, special charges for streamlining our activities and an income tax net benefit for discrete items associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures, provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you'll find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.","During the second quarter of fiscal 2019, we recognized a pre-tax special charge of $400,000 primarily related to move cost associated with the previously announced transfer of activities from a planned facility closure.","In the second quarter of the prior fiscal year, we recorded a pre-tax special charge of $600,000. We expect to continue to incur additional costs, primarily attributed to early lease termination and moving cost in future periods associated with the closing of certain facilities related to the streamlining actions announced in fiscal year 2018.","As a reminder, as part of adopting ASC 606 at the beginning of fiscal year 2019, we're providing in our Form 10-Q disaggregated revenues by the major sales channels of; one, independent sales network, which includes C&I agencies, infrastructure utility agencies, system integrators, and showrooms; two, direct sales network; three, retail network, which includes home centers and digital retail; four, corporate accounts; and five, all other which is primarily OEM, international, and catalog.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter of fiscal 2019 was 23.1% compared with a 23.1% tax benefit in the prior year quarter. The tax benefit in the second quarter of fiscal 2018 was due to recognizing a $31.2 million discrete tax benefit of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","Additionally, last year's second quarter adjusted tax rate of 17% was unusually low, as it reflected a lower blended year-to-date effective rate following the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. In other words, prior year's first quarter effective tax rate of 35.4% was lower due an adjustment of the tax provision in the second quarter.","We currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate before discrete items will approximate 24% to 26% for fiscal 2019. We generated $188 million of net cash flow provided by operating activities during the first six months of fiscal 2019 compared with $178 million for the year ago period.","Operating working capital defined as receivables, plus inventories, less payables decreased almost $36 million during the first six months of fiscal 2019. This decrease is largely due to reduced accounts receivable balance.","Our operating working capital days increased 16 days to 66 days, primarily due to higher inventory days at February 28, 2019 compared to August 31, 2018. The increase in inventory is primarily due to a buildup over the last several quarters of inventory ahead of the relaunch of our broader Contractor Select line and customer expansion in the retail channel. We are focused on improving our inventory turns as we assimilate these newer products and customers.","At February 28, 2019, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $232 million, an increase of $103 million since August 31, 2018. The increase was due primarily to cash flow from operations, partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock, to invest in plant and equipment, and to pay dividends.","We repurchased 400,000 shares for $49 million during the first six months of fiscal 2019. We have 4.8 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase board authorization. Our investment in capital expenditures was $25 million for the first six months of fiscal 2019, an increase of almost $4 million compared with the prior year period. We currently expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2019.","Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 include tooling for new products, equipment, facilities renovations, information technology, including enhancements and upgrades to our industry-leading lighting and lighting control design software of visual and our proprietary customer order portal agile, as well as normal ongoing property and equipment maintenance.","Last year, we executed a new five-year unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a total of $800 million of borrowing capacity, of which $795 million was available at February 28, 2019. Our total debt outstanding was $357 million at February 28, 2019. Our debt-to-total capitalization at February 28, 2019 was 16.5% and net debt-to-capital was 6.5%.","Our $350 million senior unsecured notes mature in December 2019. We intend to refinance these borrowings using availability under our $400 million unsecured delayed draw five-year term loan facility. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength in flexibility to support our growth opportunities, which may include acquisitions and we'll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you and I'll turn it back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. While current market conditions in lighting industry continue to be challenging, we continue to be optimistic regarding our long-term future. We believe our many actions to improve our market reach, enhance our customer solutions, and capabilities and to drive company-wide productivity, will help optimize our financial performance in the future, while affording us the opportunity to continue to invest in areas we believe have high growth potential over the long-term.","Our strong sales growth, significant cash flow and robust return on invested capital through the first half of the year are reflective of our very positive operating performance, despite some of these current industry headwinds.","Our views on overall market demand for the lighting market and items influencing costs have not really changed over the last six months. So, let me reiterate a few of those key items that could influence our performance for the balance of our fiscal 2019.","Many independent third-party forecasts continue to suggest the overall construction market, as measured in dollars, will grow in the low to mid single digit range. We still believe the lighting industry will lag the overall growth rate of construction market somewhat, primarily due to continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives for certain products, sold through certain channels, while recent industry pricing actions should have a favorable impact on growth as measured in dollars.","Additionally, we expect that labor shortages in certain markets could continue to negatively impact growth rates for both construction and lighting. While the U.S. government once again delayed the implementation of increased tariffs to 25% from the current 10% for certain imported Chinese made finished goods, we believe the outcome of the entire tariff situation could have a dampening effect on overall demand due to higher component costs and finished good prices.","Further, it is evident that the global trade issues, as well as current rhetoric regarding the potential closing of the U.S.\/Mexican border have certainly created greater volatility in demand in our various end markets and we expect that to continue.","As previously mentioned, we believe announced price increases and other actions taken will help offset the increase in cost for various items noted earlier. While increases in some input costs, such as steel have leveled off for now. We expect other costs and expenses, such as imported electrical components and finished goods, freight and wages will continue to rise. These potential cost increases could have a negative impact on our financial results due to the timing and nature of any mitigation efforts, including potential future price increases and other actions to reduce costs.","Further, we believe that product substitutions to lower-priced alternatives for certain products and certain portions of the lighting market will continue, particularly for more basic, lesser-featured products sold through certain channels, potentially pressuring both top line growth and profitability. The re-launch of our Contractor Select portfolio and other actions taken were done to enhance our opportunities for profitable growth in those portions of the market.","Foreign currency exchange rates may continue to be volatile adding further uncertainties. Excluding the impact if any of those factors just noted, we remain cautiously optimistic for the balance of fiscal 2019. Our wide and varied base of customers generally remain positive about their current year growth prospects, many customers continue to have record backlogs. So they too are concerned about the timing of releases, particularly for larger projects and the potential impact of tariffs and inflation on overall demand.","However and most importantly, we expect to continue to outperform the overall growth rate of the markets we serve primarily North America. Further, we believe the sales of our lighting control solutions as well as our Atrius-based luminaires all within our Tier 3 and 4 categories will continue to expand. So I would like to emphasize, it will be lumpy at times because of the unpredictability and timing of customers renovation and new construction schedules as well as the volatility in demand caused by global trade and political issues.","As we have noted before, our gross profit margin is influenced by several factors, including sales volume, innovation, components and commodity's costs, market pricing dynamics and changes in product and sales channel mix. Additionally, we are always striving to improve our profitability through our continuous improvement efforts.","However, we believe for any meaningful gross profit margin improvement to occur. We will need to continue to capture our implemented price increases as well as experience an acceleration in market demand for more technology-enabled lighting solutions particularly for larger commercial projects, where our contribution margins are more favorable due to the complex nature of these types of projects. This illustrates the influence of product and sales channel mix on our margin profile.","Also, as I noted earlier, we expect changes in net sales volume sold through certain customers in the retail channel will have a dampening effect on adjusted gross profit and margins. But we believe will be largely offset with lower freight and commission costs within SDA expense.","Additionally, we have initiated a review of a small portion of our product portfolio and services offering with the objective of eliminating those items and activities that do not meet our return objectives. These efforts could modestly impact our future top line growth rate, but we expect that any actions taken in this effort will be accretive to our margins and return on invested capital, more information to come in the future on the impact, if any from this initiative.","Lastly, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting, building management in our Atrius IoT platform and software solutions and our opportunities to participate in the interconnected world is an integral part of our overall long-term profitable growth strategy to meaningfully expand our addressable market, by adding broad-based holistic solutions that will allow our customers to transform their connected intelligent buildings and campuses from cost centers to strategic assets.","As I've said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry, as well as the building management systems market have the potential to experience solid growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and, more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, to more efficient and effective solutions. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, along with our Atrius platform, we are positioned well to fully participate in and lead these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you. And with that we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","Joseph Osha","Thank you. Good morning, everyone.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Joseph Osha","Two questions. First, your business continues to generate pretty solid cash flow. I'm just wondering if maybe Ricky could amplify maybe a little bit more going forward what the thoughts are about deploying net buybacks. And then also, what we might see in terms of levering the balance sheet? Then I have a follow-up.","Ricky Reece","Sure. As we've mentioned before, Joseph, our use of cash are really in three areas. One, to continue to invest in capital through capital expenditures, IT and so forth, and you see that level at the 1.5% of revenues. We've been between that and 2%.","Second is, to return to shareholders in the form of dividends and share buybacks, which we've done fairly aggressively over our careers or over the last decade, I should say. And then, thirdly is acquisitions. I would say acquisitions after our normal capital CapEx spending is probably our preferred use.","We see opportunities to continue to fill in areas of product gaps as well as to expand our technology, and we'll continue to look at opportunities whether it's acquiring people or partnering or minority investments. And it's an active pipeline out there. So that's an area that we continue to see opportunity, and we'll use our cash flow to create shareholder returns in that way.","When the M&A activity isn't as robust or we opportunistically see a benefit to repurchase shares, we'll do that. And as you know, we have a fair amount still left under the board authorization to buy back shares. We bought back 400,000 this -- so far this year. So we'll continue to do that as well. So those are the primary plans for our use of capital.","Joseph Osha","Okay. Thank you. And just as a quick follow up, you had in the past indicated the willingness to lever the business to certain multiple of EBITDA, do you still see that kind of debt-to-EBITDA number going up over time?","Ricky Reece","You could argue we're underlevered today. So, I could see our leverage going up either through M&A or share buybacks. We do want to maintain our investment-grade rating which would suggest 2.5 turns of EBITDA or probably less. Not to say that on a great opportunity for M&A or something, we might not hit that or exceed it knowing we could quickly pay it back down. But we do want to maintain our investment grade rating and that would dictate a ceiling probably in that 2.5 turns of debt as a ceiling.","Joseph Osha","Okay.","Vern Nagel","And we continue to see an active pipeline of M&A as Ricky points out. And as you know M&A is never something that you can precisely predict. They have to be both doable and desirable at the same time, meaning from a financial perspective. So, it's again interesting in terms of technology opportunities as well as niche space lighting companies.","Joseph Osha","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Lee","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Just had a couple here. I guess first off on the mix shift here in retail, just thinking like, you would have less control on the sales channel for this part of the market, hence the lower SG&A expenses if I'm reading it correctly.","How should we think about what that means for both potential and just the part of the business -- as a part of your mix that just goes in line with the industry given the competition in this channel? So, if you could just maybe help walk through the growth sort of puts and takes for that particular channel?","Ricky Reece","Okay. Brian, sounds like there's a food fight going on at Goldman Sachs. Not certain that we heard all of question, but when we think about our retail channel, we see opportunities for continued diversification and growth.","But you know, again, we have to look at the trade-off in terms of are those solution sets that they are providing appropriate for returns on our own business.","But we see the retail channel as an opportunity for us again to continue to diversify our customer base. We're doing that. And obviously that has some impact, because these customers all have different service requirements, which as I mentioned in my previous -- or my prepared remarks do have an influence on how we basically account for some of these things, some of the items are above the line, so they enhance gross profit some of the things such as freight.","I mean this is a really simple issue. It's just depends on whether we provide freight of the material or that end customer provides freight and then the adjustment is the price. So -- but again, our view around the retail channel is continued opportunity to leverage our brand and to leverage the supply chain that we have in place for profitable growth.","Brian Lee","Okay, great. Hopefully, it\u2019s a little bit better. On the -- maybe second question just on channel and product mix, I know these were issues for you guys that just I guess started to materialize that you couldn\u2019t shift in the past couple of quarters. So, wondering if it's the right assumption to anticipate that the revenue of fiscal 2019 is going to see this impact in a similar range on a year-on-year basis due to offsetting the recent price increases like you saw here in fiscal 2018? Thanks guys.","Vern Nagel","Yes, the food fight is still alive and well at Goldman Sachs. I think the question was based around sales channel mix and its impact. First of all, let me make a comment on pricing. We were very pleased with the price capture that we were able to achieve in the second quarter, and really there's still more to come as it rolls through. But just so everyone understands, while price capture for us, we believe contributed low-single digit to our growth, I understand that probably two-thirds of our business is really bid business. And I think it's very different than some of our competitors. So that one-third that is subject to price list and so on and so forth is really where the price increases were put in place.","When it comes to our bid business, we are always looking to sell the value of our solutions and optimize our profitability as best we can. We're very pleased this quarter with how, again the realization of price help to offset the great deal of the cost that we had. Some of the channel mix discussion that we bring up really is the fact that this quarter had what we believe was anomaly, because of the pull forward within the C&I market as people trying to avoid price increases placing their orders early.","And so therefore, in Q2, we saw a drop in sales volume in the C&I market. But when we look at our overall business, it grew over 3% sales volume. So, it was other channels that allowed us to show growth. So, again, our Distech, BMS team just knocked the ball out of the park in Q2 and they have been doing that, they're doing a great job. That's within our independent sales network, if you will, channel. We also had growth in our infrastructure and utility. We had growth in our corporate accounts channel.","So, all of these have very dynamics of both gross profit margin profile, as well as them below the line -- the gross profit line, the service requirements. So, when we talk about all of these sales channel mix, it's alive and well for Acuity. I think the bottom line on all of this is the 50 bps of operating profit improvement that you saw in the quarter.","So, we're doing the right things of raising prices, differentiating our product solutions, getting after productivity improvements within our organization yet price increases, all of this is to drive and I'm really pleased with how our folks drove an improvement on operating profit margins. We didn\u2019t talk about variable contribution margin, but variable contribution margin this quarter was like over 30%.","So, we're focused on the right things. We're looking to improve stock. We made commentary that we're looking at certain portions of our portfolio. This is small, it's not big. But just to say, hey, are we getting the right kinds of returns, both on sales and return on investment? They are appropriate with the objectives that we have. So, I think you'll continue to see channel mix, but we're coming into historically our second half, which is as larger volumes in the first half, some of those mix shifts should result in some more favorability to us.","Brian Lee","[Technical Difficulty]","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Christopher Glynn","Yeah, thanks. Good morning. Just following up on the price topic. Just wondering, how you'd mark where you might be along the expected price capture and realization ultimately as you work through some of the big business in quote protection? You think you're kind of halfway there? A couple of quarters out from what you see is kind of steady state based on the dynamics you've addressed so far?","Vernon Nagel","You know, Chris, it's a good question. And it's just \u2013 it's an educated guess. So take it for what it's worth. I would say that, we probably still have another quarter of just a little bit of noise around that, but as I said earlier, really pleased with the price capture on that portion of our business that is off of a price \u2013 based off a price sheet. I think others have said the same thing. So we'll see.","On the project side, again, projects, we are always looking to differentiate our value proposition taking into account all aspects of that including costs to drive the difference.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then, with expected continued mix pressure within the retail dynamics, can price offset that and get you to gross margin positive over the next few quarters? Or is there just too much contention there with the mix dynamic?","Ricky Reece","Yeah. So don't use the word contention. What it is, is just how different people, different customers in that channel handle different aspects. The easiest one to understand is freight. Some people provide their own freight. And so they take that off if you will the sales price. So that has a gross profit dynamic. Some people ask us to provide the freight, and therefore, it's a higher price consultant.","So it's \u2013 the dynamic is really not a problematic maybe accounting treatment goes for that. We expect that dynamic to continue. So it's a reset, if you will of your \u2013 the notion of what historical margins for that channel may have been at gross profit in an operating profit. And operating profit is essentially have offset the difference. It's just that \u2013 its influence our gross profit and our SDA expense, primarily freight and commission. And you saw that this quarter as our SDA expense was down pretty significantly.","And so that, as you think about your models, all of you think about your models going forward. I would say that, historically, our freight and commission is operated between say 11% and 12% of sales the way we do our accounting. You know, we'll probably be at the very low end of that range on a go forward basis. So if you're going to see overall SDA be down a little bit because of that on a go forward basis. But the margin profile will also be down as a result of that.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then, you mentioned in the press release focus on improving mix of products and solutions. Just want to clarify exactly what that means, because I think you're kind of steadiest growth is the large enterprise solutions, customers that may in fact have the opposite effect within mix from the perspective of margins?","Ricky Reece","Yeah. So we are very excited about the growth rates that we are experiencing in our corporate accounts. Again, as I mentioned, those corporate accounts have a different -- I mean, it's all part of the same type of fixture, but they're driving the ability for us to ultimately sell an Atrius-enabled solution, more of the SaaS revenue kind of thing. So laying the track has really been a very positive thing. And it's growing our business very nicely.","We're well over two billion square feet of Atrius-enabled fixtures, which is just a staggering number and continuing to grow at an unbelievable pace. While the gross profit margin profile of that is below, if you will, with the C&I channel, so when we talk about channel mix, our focus is to -- key portion of our team is to drive and improve the C&I overall mix, particularly around larger projects. Those things continue just to be sluggish in terms of their release.","Backlogs continuity for these types of projects is favorable, but they're slow to release. That's what people tell us, it has to do with labor shortages in certain markets. So what people are doing is amping up their education, trying to recruit more electricians, so on and so forth.","So we believe that this problem gets solved, because the overall market dynamics, employment, rising commercial rental rates and industrial rates, vacancy rates, all these things are flashing big dream size. That usually means that if there's and now an uptick coming in the build of that type of real estate, backlogs that customers will suggest that that is true. But we haven't seen the releases of some of these larger projects. So that's what we mean by improving our channel mix.","Christopher Glynn","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, in order to provide everyone the opportunity to ask questions, the company asks that you please limit yourself to two questions per caller. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Deepa Raghavan","Good morning. Vern, just some commentary on how the quarter progressed month wise? That will be helpful. And if you can talk about any improved momentum or not, well into March, now that March is under the belt?","Vern Nagel","Yes. The quarter was lumpy, in terms of orders. Again, it's always difficult to quantify exactly why. It's certainly early into the quarter, so the December month for us was influenced by the pull forward. I also believe that January was impacted into a degree by weather in key parts of the country. We had a little bit of a government shutdown, so I'm at grasping at straws to try and explain why there was this lumpiness.","We are starting to see improvements in the overall order rate. And we would expect that, because, again, you're coming out of seasonally, for us, our second quarter is always our softest quarter. And then we have the build going into Q3 and Q4. So probably a little bit too early to say that, let's declare a victory and this is the way it's going to be. But we see favorability and we continue to hear favorability.","Deepa Raghavan","That's the commentary for March?","Vern Nagel","We don't give commentary on [Indiscernible]. I'm just saying that, what we saw as we departed Q2, we saw an improvement. We saw lumpiness in Q2 and we're now starting to see favorability relative to that lumpiness.","Deepa Raghavan","Understood. My second question is what are your thoughts on recent lighting industry M&A? I mean you're seeing this Cree's fixture business being sold to private family business, GEs current business going to BE and now that Ethon has announced the spin as well. What does it say about the lighting industry as such?","And secondly, is there an interest for you to participate in this? Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Thank you. My comment on the lighting industry is it's not going anywhere. I mean it's a robust industry, it's growing. It brings a lot of value. I think that some of the smaller bit players like Cree, they didn't make the right investments and they miss stepped and so they didn't win.","Acuity has been investing heavily for the last decade building on the controls platform, building on an IoT platform. I think that with Ethon's announcement that they're going to spin their lighting business, I think that that was the portfolio decision. Lighting was a very small part of Ethon's overall portfolio and so they made a decision.","But Ethon's lighting business isn't going anywhere. It's going to become its own public company. And so I don't see the notion of people making investment decisions as somehow being indicative of a lighting industry.","When Ethon came out and said, here our performance, our requirements, and our lighting business doesn't quite meet those, Acuity far exceeds those types of performance and requirements.","Our operating profit margin, yes, this quarter, 13.2% improving. Our topline we continue to grow. Our controls business continues to add improvement there. Yes, we're dealing with the notion of product substitution from -- to lower-priced alternatives, so we're fighting, if you will, that trend. But we believe that we will be able to improve our margins both gross profit as well as operating profit over time.","I'm bullish on the lighting industry and where it's going to go. I think that some of these competitors that again the M&A has been with relatively minor players so far. The spend of Ethon's lighting business is not an M&A event, they're alive and well.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Ryan Merkel","Great. Thanks. So, first question from me, may be discussed in more detail, what products and services you're reviewing? And what the impact could be to sales and margin?","Ricky Reece","So, as part of our normal course, we look at product lifecycle management, in the past where product lifecycles have been much longer and more traditional or conventional lighting.","With the LED -- the advent of LED, it's no longer a new technology, it's around -- product lifecycles have become shorter. The ability to be more innovative with form factors and how you put technology inside those luminaries. It just shortens up the product lifecycle.","So, what we're doing in my view is nothing more than a normal review of product lifecycle management and making decisions around why are we going to continue to offer something that is no longer in our view effective relative to new form factors or new capabilities, I don't perceive that it's going to have a significant impact on our top line. So, any impact to us, I expect it to have a offsetting positive impact on our margins and our return on investments.","So, to me, the reason we\u2019re mentioning it, is because we want people to understand that we're doing this with the expectation is well, I don't think it will be significant on our top line. It will have some impact, but we also believe it will improve our operating profit margins, as well as our return on invested capital, which by the way, is quite robust.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. That\u2019s helpful clarification. And then secondly, when do you expect the higher margin part of the Atrius solution to begin impacting the P&L? Because it seems to me that we're still not really telling a whole lot out of the Tier 4, but maybe help us with that?","Vern Nagel","Yeah. No, it's interesting, it's a great question. Against the backdrop of Acuity Brands, which is almost a $4 billion business, it's hard to have an activity that is growing nicely spiced the stew so significantly that you say, oh my gosh, you know I can now see the difference. We are getting great growth in our corporate accounts because people want the benefit of the Atrius-enabled capability. When they buy that, they usually wait till they have enough critical mass before they start to, if you will, drive the Ferrari. But for the early adopters, we are seeing interesting activity.","It is positive to what we're doing. Where we're getting the growth so far is in our corporate account, as we continue to push the technology, enhance the technology, hone the technology, all the words that you want to use, once we're able to now more specifically control and once we have the opportunity to put it in the hands of our agents and I still think we're probably 12 to 18 months out where we can actually sell solutions into various verticals through that sales force, it will be a powerful capability, profit generator for Acuity.","Ryan Merkel","That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.","Tim Wojs","Hey, guys. Good morning. Just two follow-ups for me. So, the first is on inflation, the last couple of quarters you had called out a headwind to gross profit, I think last quarter it was $16 million and in Q4 it was $20 million. Any color on what that was in the February quarter?","And then secondly, just to put a little finer point on this mix issue. As you look forward, it's not unreasonable for us to think that all-in you should actually start to see margin improvement on an EBIT basis, despite some of the mix issues with gross margins?","Vern Nagel","Sure. You saw on an EBIT basis improvement in Q2\u2026","Tim Wojs","Exactly, yeah.","Vern Nagel","\u202650 basis points, our expectation is that we will continue to drive improvement at the operating profit level. So, to me, our -- coming back to your previous question, our costs continued, but let me start to imagine that we\u2019re getting closer to where we're anniversaring some of that costs. Those -- some -- those numbers, the difference isn't as great.","But yet, you would say, okay, it has a deteriorating impact on your margin. This is where the price increase -- price increases were very helpful in helping to lessen that. And as we said, we believe that our price increases are contributed low single-digit to our overall growth, which when you then further imagine that it really applies mostly to about a third of our business, we did get pretty solid capture.","So a little bit of that sales channel mix we get this quarter noise, because of the pull-forward through the C&I channel or the C&I market, I should say, because of the price increases implemented on that, that caused a bit of a distortion. We still saw a great growth in our corporate accounts, and again, just a big shout-out to our Distech BMS team, they really put some big points on the board. So and we expect that to continue. Those are \u2013 that actually is margin accretive to us. So cost was an issue, tariffs issue, price increases benefited that the mix, the channel mix had to do with the pull-forward into Q1 from the C&I side.","Tim Wojs","Okay. Great. So EBIT margins that expansion should continue going forward?","Vernon Nagel","Well, we're not providing guidance. But as you might imagine that\u2026","Tim Wojs","I try. Okay. Great. Well, good luck on the second half guys. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Hey. Just let me come back to one of your earlier questions that might have been lost about whether the lighting industry is going away, and more about, does it make sense in this environment for you guys to explore being a consolidate tour in an environment where arguably there's too much capacity or is that kind of contrary to your strategy and you'd rather just try to pull away from the path organically?","Vernon Nagel","Yeah. So we continue to look at all types of M&A, whether it's technology, technology within lighting, technology within BMS, technology within Atrius as well as lighting businesses that can enhance our portfolio. The Juno acquisition was a great example of a company that fit very nicely and fill the gap with us, the Juno team, fantastic opportunity. But also look we acquired Lucid, again, a fantastic company to help us drive more of our SaaS opportunities.","So we are looking at a broad playing field, businesses that \u2013 the most recent transactions that have been announced where there has been M&A that spin-out. Those businesses \u2013 there was really no reason for us to participate in that. We believe that, we have a robust portfolio, talented people, and as you point out, we would go at that and look to grow organically in the marketplace to tidy up a competitor or buy something like either of those two businesses. I think would have been really dilutive to our returns and our attention.","So where we are active in the M&A world on all aspects like Ricky pointed out, but for us to drive consolidation with some of the companies that were available that would not have been a benefit to Acuity shareholders.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thanks. And then separate question, totally understand your comment about the price increases and list price going through a-third of your business, but does that activity significantly influence your ability to capture price on bids? Is there a kind of element of some sort of priced umbrella or just kind of general tone in the market around positive price that would feed into, while you're bidding activity?","Vern Nagel","Yes. So once we bid and the bid has been accepted, this is where some of the previous jobs that have been either part of our agents' backlog are now part of our backlog, a lot of that was price protected. As we look forward, we're looking at how do we continue to differentiate our solution set.","This is where our controls platform is very helpful to us, in adding differentiated value. And we are looking at what our cost structure is, but we price to the market opportunity, not to our cost structure. We look to improve our cost structure to drive margin influence, but higher cost in the marketplace does find its way into the project side of the world on future bids.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our question-and-answer session for today's call. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vern Nagel for any closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you everyone for your time this morning. Again, we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that have the potential over the longer term to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is bright. And thank you for your support.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude today's program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a wonderful day."],"651":["Acuity Brands, Inc.

Baird & Co","Operator","Good morning. And welcome to the Acuity Brands' Fiscal 2019 Fourth Quarter Financial Conference Call. After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you and good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2019 fourth quarter and full year results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President, and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Holcom, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We are webcasting today's conference at acuitybrands.com. I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, such that actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now, let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. We had a solid fourth quarter given market conditions and look forward to providing you with further analysis of our results in a moment. However, before I start, I would like to introduce to you Karen Holcom as our new Chief Financial Officer. Karen is a 21 year veteran at Acuity and knows our business and strategy exceedingly well. More importantly, she is focused on helping to execute our strategy to optimize value for our key stakeholders. Please join me in welcoming Karen to her new role. ","Karen succeeds Ricky Reece, CFO, who was recently promoted to President of Acuity. We will leverage Ricky\u2019s experience and knowledge of our business with his primary focus to drive our commercial growth plans. So, with those announcements complete, Karen and I would like to make a few comments, and then we will be happy to answer your questions. ","2019 was one of the most challenging years we've experienced at Acuity. The markets we serve were in a constant state of flux throughout much of the year. Inflationary pressures at the beginning of the year were exacerbated by the number of market shocks, including the addition of significant tariffs placed on Chinese made components and finished goods, uncertainty created by the threat of further trade actions, and labor shortages in key markets. These issues and more created great economic uncertainty, tempering demand for lighting products in both the residential and non-residential construction markets.","Further, we and our many channel partners had to deal with multiple price increases due to rising costs and tariffs which further whipsawed demand creating great stress and uncertainty for our supply chain. Obviously, these issues pose many significant challenges for us to manage, yet we feel our performance was strong given this environment. We made the decision early on to focus on those opportunities that were within our control, optimizing where we could and reacting quickly with the best of our abilities to those market influences that were beyond our control, including tariffs and the continued threat of additional ones.","Our many actions to optimize our performance in this environment included multiple price increases, introduction of new products and solutions, and aggressive initiatives to drive company-wide productivity. Part of this effort included eliminating or reducing our exposure to certain products whose profitability was most negatively impacted by the tariffs, and sold primarily through the retail sales channel. While these actions resulted in lower net sales, they served to significantly enhance our adjusted profit margins and our free cash flow.","I know many of you have already seen our results and Karen will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights. First for the fourth quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $938 million, down almost 12% from the year ago period, certainly more than we originally anticipated. Reported operating profit was $103.3 million compared with $143.7 million in the year ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share were $2.42 compared with $2.70 in the year ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain other add backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods as Karen will explain later in the call.","In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2019 was $146.1 million or 15.6% of net sales, compared with adjusted operating profit of $156 million in the year ago period or 14.7% of net sales. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were $2.75, a quarterly record, up 3% from the year ago period.","Now, for the full year. Net sales in 2019 were $3.7 billion, essentially flat from 2018 despite the drop in net sales in the fourth quarter. Reported operating profit was $463 million compared to $461 million in the year ago period, while diluted earnings per share was $8.29 compared with $8.52 earned in the year ago period. Adjusted operating profit was $528 million compared with $534 million reported in the year ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin in 2019 was 14.4%, down 10 basis points from a year earlier.","Adjusted diluted EPS was $9.57, a record up 8% from 2018. In addition, we generated a record $495 million in net cash provided by operating activities this year as we significantly reduced inventory levels primarily due to improved supply chain performance. Karen will provide more detail on this later in the call. We closed the year with $461 million in cash on hand even after repurchasing $82 million of the company\u2019s shares, spending $53 million for capital expenditures and funding $21 million in dividends this year, leaving us with plenty of capacity to execute our growth strategies.","Lastly, I'm pleased to report we estimate that our return on invested capital in 2019 was 800 basis points greater than our average weighted average cost to capital. We believe that our many return performance metrics are industry leading. Your own calculations will highlight these positive returns. Looking at some specific details for the quarter, net sales were down 11.6% when compared with the year-ago period. Overall, net sales value declined slightly more than 16%. Changes in price mix were favorable by approximately 5% compared with the prior year. This improvement was primarily due to implemented price increases and changes in channel mix, partially offset by changes in the mix of products sold. We estimate the realization from recent price increases contributed low single digits to our positive price mix performance this quarter. Other items influencing the change in net sales this quarter were not collectively or individually significant.","These next few points are very important in explaining the movement in our topline. From a channel perspective, while we experienced declines in most channels, there were three key areas of significance. First, low shipments to the retail channel accounted for more than half of the total decline in net sales this quarter compared with the year ago period. The largest portion of the decline in this channel was primarily due to the impact of load-ins in the year ago period for certain new customers, which did not repeat this year.","The remaining portion of the decline in this channel was due in part to actions taken by the company to perform a comprehensive review of our product portfolio to eliminate or significantly reduce shipments of those products whose profitability was most negatively impacted by the additional tariffs. As we mentioned in previous earnings calls, we expected these efforts to result in lower net sales, primarily in the retail sales channel.","Second, net sales through our independent sales network in our direct sales network were off by approximately 4% this quarter. Our performance in these two channels was impacted by some pull forward of orders into the third quarter to avoid an increase in product prices due to additional tariffs. Continued weak demand primarily for larger commercial projects and the completion of certain larger infrastructure projects in the year ago period, partially offset by implemented price increases; market share gains in certain lighting categories, including lighting controls at our contractor select portfolio, as well as growth of our building management solutions platform at Distech, which again performed exceptionally well this quarter.","While shipments in the C&I market included within our independent sales network channel were down slightly, we believe that our performance was reflective of overall market conditions and not specific to Acuity. Lastly, net sales in our Corporate Accounts Channel were down 20% this quarter compared with the year ago period, primarily due to the completion of certain projects in the year ago period that did not repeat this quarter, and to a lesser degree slower releases for certain renovation projects. As we have noted in previous earnings calls, while we expect net sales through this channel to be very lumpy based on the nature of the construction cycle the customers served primarily big-box retailers. We continued to add to the total square footage covered by our connected lighting, Atrius based IoT solutions.","I will speak more about the advancements in this channel later in the call. With regard to the impact on net sales for changes in price mix, the overall net impact was significantly positive this quarter. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in price and mix, we estimate the impact of price increases contributed low single digits to our positive price mix performance this quarter. This positive price capture was further enhanced by changes in channel mix, partially offset by the mix of products sold. The positive change in channel mix this quarter was mostly influenced by the decline in net sales of lower margin products sold through the retail channel, partially offset by product substitutions to lower priced alternatives, primarily for more basic, lesser featured LED luminaries sold in certain channels, as well as a modest decline in shipments for larger commercial projects.","Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $146 million, down approximately $10 million compared with the year ago period. While adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 15.6%, up 90 basis points from the year ago period. This was the highest adjusted operating profit margin posted by the company in the last seven quarters and meaningful improvements on both a sequential and year-over-year basis. Furthermore, there are some additional points for you to consider as you evaluate our financial performance in the quarter.","First, our adjusted gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 42.1%, an increase of 320 basis points compared with a year ago period, a huge improvement. Adjusted gross profit was $395 million, down approximately $18 million from the year ago period. The decline in adjusted gross profit was primarily due to lower net sales within the independent sales network in corporate accounts. The impact from the under absorption of manufacturing operating costs as a consequence of our inventory reduction efforts this year compared with the year ago period, and to a much lesser degree the drop in net sales through the retail sales channel.","We estimate the negative impact on gross profit due to the under absorption of manufacturing operating cost was approximately $10 million this quarter. Further, if one were to compare the change in adjusted operating profit this quarter compared to the year ago period, excluding the impact of under absorption of manufacturing operating costs in both periods, the decline in adjusted operating profit this year would have been only approximately $5 million on a decline in net sales of one $123 million. The really important point here is that our efforts to prune our product portfolio and reduce our channel exposure to those products that do not meet our profit profile and to capture price, as well as improve our supply chain performance all had a positive impact on our adjusted profit margins this quarter, while not unduly impacting our profitability.","Also our adjusted SDA expenses were down approximately $9 million compared with the year ago period. Adjusted SDA expenses, a percentage of net sales were 26.5% in the fourth quarter, an increase of 230 basis points from the year ago period, primarily due to the decline in net sales. The decline in SDA expense was primarily due to lower freight expense as a result of the drop in net sales and productivity improvements. Our adjusted diluted EPS was a quarterly record of $2.75 compared with $2.68 reported in the year ago period, an increase of 3%. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted net income which was benefited primarily by a lower effective tax rate this quarter, as well as lower average shares outstanding.","Before I turn the call over to Karen, I would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this year. On the strategic and technology front, we continue to make significant strides setting the stage for what we believe will be solid growth in revenue and profitability over the long term. In 2019, we introduced almost 100 new product families, expanding our industry-leading portfolio, partially offsetting the impact of our pruning efforts to reduce the sale of lower margin products sold primarily in the retail channel, where price capture was a challenge.","Our new product introductions continue to be well received by the market, some winning various awards for innovation. We gained or maintain market share in many important product categories and sales channels. Tier 3 and 4 solutions grew approximately 15% this year and now make up approximately 20% of our total revenues. From a commercial perspective, 2019 brought continued success of our connected lighting Atrius enabled solutions. Our products and services enjoy strong market acceptance in retail applications, now deployed in over 5,000 retail stores in North America, netting over 500 million square feet of sales floor space under our connected lighting sensory network.","We have several large retailers with our Atrius SaaS applications now deployed or in detailed evaluation. Initially, we received feedback that our retail clients found that the energy and maintenance benefits of our Intelligent Luminaires to be a strong economic value proposition. While also seeing embedded future-proof sensors as a nice-to-have. Currently, those early technology adopters are now activating Atrius services as part of their customer engagement, customer insight and associate productivity enhancement programs. Increasingly, we see data analytics and data science opportunities generated by our connected lighting Atrius platforms as critical areas of investment allowing retailers and now others to garner valuable insights about their businesses from our services.","Additionally, we expanded our connected lighting Atrius based solutions into other verticals as awareness by these customers of our meaningful points of differentiation and the broad capabilities of our IoT solutions significantly. Particularly as they realize the opportunity to transform their spaces from expense items to strategic assets. Today, we have nearly 10 million square feet of connected lighting Atrius enabled space in passenger terminals at four of the top airports in the United States, including Atlanta, Denver, Las Vegas and Seattle, which handle approximately 125 million passengers per year with more projects on the way.","Net sales of our contractor select portfolio grew nicely in 2019, particularly in the C&I market and now make up approximately 10% of our net sales. Contractor selected, our fighter brand in response to those Chinese based lighting companies, many of which we believe are clearly being subsidized in some form that are influencing pricing for certain basic, lesser featured fixtures sold in certain channels. Again, we are very pleased with the growth and profitability of this product portfolio. And we will not yield this portion of the market for many strategic reasons.","We made significant strides in expanding our industry-leading lightning control platform and light as well as our building management system business, Distech, where both units grew double digits in 2019. We believe the Acuity has the most comprehensive and feature-rich wired and wireless lighting control systems available and importantly are connected to our growing BMS solutions, providing customers with even greater functionality. Further, we initiated many actions this year to further streamline our operations to reduce costs and improve our productivity.","We believe these initiatives will enhance our future operating and financial performance, as well as allow us to accelerate investments in areas with higher growth opportunities. Also as I noted in our previous earnings call, we initiated comprehensive reviews this year in two key areas of our company, compensation and environmental, social and governance or ESG. These reviews which included feedback and insights from our shareholder base resulted in important modifications and enhancements to both programs. Our ESG program is helping us to identify further opportunities to drive efficiencies, reduce costs, increase our positive impact on the environment and increase associate engagement and satisfaction.","And lastly, we continue our efforts to complement our solutions portfolio with strategic acquisitions and investments, including the acquisition of The Luminaires Group in mid-September. The Luminaires Group is a leading provider of specification grade luminaires for commercial, institutional, hospitality and municipal markets, all of which complements our architectural platform. We are pleased to welcome the 350 associates of The Luminaires Group to the Acuity family.","Our solid performance this year as a result of the dedication and resolve of our 12,000 associates, who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our key stakeholders. I will talk more about our expectations for fiscal year 2020 later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Karen. Karen?","Karen Holcom","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. I'm happy to be on the call with you today. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had a few adjustments to the GAAP results in the fourth quarter and for the full year of fiscal 2019 and 2018 which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2019 and 2018. Adjusted results exclude the impact of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, share based payment expense, manufacturing inefficiencies and excess inventory adjustments directly related to the closure of a facility. Acquisition related items, special charges for streamlining activities, a gain on the sale of our former Spanish lighting business and an income tax benefit for discrete items associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operation. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. Recall that during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018, we reversed pre-tax special charges of $5 million, a certain previously planned streamlining activities were no longer expected to occur primarily because we were successful in selling our former Spanish lighting business for a gain during the quarter.","During the fourth quarter of this fiscal year, we recorded net pre-tax special charges of $0.5 million related primarily to certain streamlining activities. Additionally in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, we incurred $1.3 million of expenses related to acquisition and investment activities. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019 was 20.2%, compared with 21.1% in the year ago period. The decline in the current fiscal tax rate reflects a lower blended federal statutory tax rate and certain research and development cost tax credits including claims for prior periods recognized during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.","Prior year's fourth quarter tax rate benefited from $3.4 million of discrete income tax benefits resulting from the TCJA. We currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate before discrete items will approximate 23% for fiscal 2020. Shortly after the end of our fourth quarter on September 17th, 2019, we completed the acquisition of The Luminaires Group headquartered in Montreal, Canada. The Luminaires Group which is comprised of five distinct brands is a leading provider of specification grade luminaires for commercial, institutional, hospitality and municipal markets. TLG generates annual sales of approximately a $100 million and employs over 350 associates located across five locations in the US and Canada.","Management expects that the acquisition will be immediately accretive to fiscal 2020 adjusted earnings. We did not disclose the terms of the acquisition. We generated a record $495 million of net cash flow provided by operating activities during fiscal 2019, compared with $352 million for the year ago period, an increase of $143 million. We reduced our inventory by $71 million during fiscal 2019 as a result of our efforts to improve inventory turns, which we have accomplished while also improving customer service.","At August 31st, 2019, we had a cash position of $461 million, an increase of $332 million since August 31st, 2018. The increase was due primarily to record net cash flow from operations, partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock, invest in plant and equipment and pay dividends. We repurchase 650,000 shares of the company's common stock for $82 million during fiscal 2019. We have approximately 4.6 million shares remaining under our current authorization. Our investments in capital expenditures were $53 million for fiscal 2019 or approximately 1.4% of net sales.","We currently expect to invest approximately 1.7% of net sales in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2020. Last year, we executed a new five-year unsecured revolving credit facility in term loan with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a total of $800 million of borrowing capacity of which $796 million was available at August 31st, 2019. Our total debt outstanding was $357 million at August 31st, 2019 and our debt to capitalization at August 31st, 2019 was 16%.","Our $350 million senior unsecured notes mature in December 2019. We intend to refinance these borrowings using availability under our $400 million unsecured delayed draw five-year term loan facility. Our record cash flow performance in fiscal 2019 has afforded us with significant financial strength and flexibility to support our growth opportunities which may include additional acquisitions. We will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. Thank you and I will turn it back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Karen. This is probably the most important portion of this call. Our outlook and our focus for 2020. While current market conditions in the overall lighting industry continue to be challenging, we are optimistic regarding our long-term future and that of our key markets. We believe our many actions to improve our market reach, enhance our customer solutions and capabilities and drive company-wide productivity will help optimize our financial performance in the future, while affording us the opportunity to continue to invest in areas we believe have high profitable growth potential over the long term.","That notwithstanding, we believe current market demand for lighting is sluggish. We believe the catalysts for these tepid conditions are primarily due to continued concerns over key economic issues including global trade policies and the potential for future tariffs. We expect these market conditions to continue for the foreseeable future and until such time as there is more clarity and certainty regarding these key economic issues. In addition, we believe there are a few other factors that will continue to influence the lighting market, including continued product substitution to lower price alternatives for certain products sold through certain channels, labor shortages in certain markets and continued cost increases, particularly for imported electronic, electrical components and finished goods, freight and wages. The recent pricing action should help to mitigate some of these factors.","Given this market environment, we can only focus on those areas within our control and react to the best of our abilities to those influences beyond our control. We believe the maniacal focus on a few key areas coupled with precise execution of our plans will afford us the best opportunity to produce favorable results for our key stakeholders. So in 2020, our primary focus will be on two key areas. Growth through market share gains and margin improvement. Let's start with our growth initiatives. Our focus will be on the following. Number one; leverage our leading access to market with continued new products and solutions based on our tiered solution or tiered strategy approach. Similar to the last few years, we are again planning to introduce over 100 new product families in 2020, many with embedded controls technology, as well as further leveraging our architectural brands with the acquisition of The Luminaires Group.","Number two; accelerate the expansion of our connected lighting Atrius IoT solutions platform both in retail where we continue to have great success. And into new verticals including transportation, healthcare, warehousing and distribution and commercial office. To do so we are adding additional resources and capabilities with the creation of our Applied Technology team to focus on these additional verticals and to build on the success we are having in the retail vertical.","As I noted earlier, our initial efforts into these new verticals is encouraging. Number three; accelerate our efforts to capture additional market share for discretionary, renovation projects in multiple channels. The installed base continues to represent a huge opportunity for profitable growth. And number four; build on the success of our contractor select portfolio to drive further growth for certain basic lesser featured fixtures. ","With regard to margin improvement initiatives, our focus in 2020 will be in the following key areas. Number one; capture profit and margin growth through the introduction of new products and solutions. Number two; continue to reduce our product costs through the redesign efforts. Number three; finalize the consolidation and closure of two distribution locations by the end of the first quarter to reduce our cost base. Number four; drive further company-wide productivity gains through our lean deployment processes. And lastly, manage our fixed operating cost by exploring opportunities to further leverage our supply chain footprint and our SDA investment.","These growth and margin improvement initiatives in 2020 are part of our long-term growth strategy to fulsomely leverage our market leadership position with technology enabled solutions that are differentiated and valued by customers, so we can gain further market share and to appropriately structure our business to the current opportunities to enhance our profitability and cash flow. Further, we believe the sales of our lighting and BMS control solutions, as well as our Atrius based luminaires all within our Tier 3 and 4 categories will continue to expand. Though and I would like to again emphasize it will be lumpy at times because of the unpredictability and timing of customers renovation and new construction schedules, as well as the volatility in demand caused by global trade and political issues.","The next point is very important. While as a matter of policy, we don't give earnings guidance, we feel it is important for all investors and analysts to understand that we believe our net sales could be down again this coming first quarter compared with the year ago period. The primary reason for the this is that net sales last year were significantly benefited by the pull forward of orders from customers attempting to avoid implemented price increases due to inflationary pressures and the impact of tariffs enacted on certain components and finished goods manufactured in China. And to a lesser degree the continued load in to a new customer in the retail sales channel, which resulted in a combined 11% growth in net sales in the year ago period.","At that time, we acknowledge it was impossible for us to quantify the precise impact of the pull forward of order due to the then implemented price increases. Because we do not expect either of these situations to repeat this quarter. It makes our ability to quantify the changes between the first quarter of 2020 to the year ago period a significant challenge. The situation is further exacerbated by continued pruning of our product portfolios noted earlier. Nonetheless, our best guess is that net sales could be down in the first quarter of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019 in the mid to high single-digit percent, partially offset by the addition of The Luminaires Group. ","Additionally, as we noted earlier, we initiated a review in late 2019 of our product portfolio and services offered primarily through the retail channel, with the objective of eliminating those items and activities that do not meet our financial objectives. These efforts have and should continue to impact our top-line growth rate and could be further exacerbated by future trade policy changes and potential additional tariffs. Further, the execution of our integrated tiered solution strategy, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and Tier 4 holistic lighting, building management and our Atrius IoT platform and software solutions and our opportunities to participate in the interconnected world is an integral part of our overall growth, long-term profitable growth strategy to meaningfully expand our addressable market by adding broad-based holistic solutions that will allow our customers to transform their connected, intelligent buildings and campuses from cost centers to strategic assets.","As I noted earlier, we intend to make additional investments in this area in 2020, including potential acquisitions and minority investments to drive our market leading advantage in these emerging growth markets. Lastly, our goal is to outperform the growth rates of our key markets and channels. Within the retail sales channel, we expect to participate by servicing the needs of our customers in a mutually beneficial manner. In total, we expect to show positive growth in 2020. While the turmoil in the current environment is unsettling and impossible to predict when uncertainty gives way to clarity.","We believe the lighting and lighting related industry, as well as the building management systems market have the potential to experience solid growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and more importantly the conversion of the installed base which is enormous in size to more efficient and effective solutions. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, along with our Atrius platform, we believe we are positioned well to fully participate in and lead these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you. And with that we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]","Our first question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","ChristopherGlynn","Thank you. Good morning and Karen welcome to the call., So just curious about maybe a big picture on some of the structural channel shifts, Vern, in the context of the topline pressure reported. Just curious from a couple perspectives about your base run rates in the channel mix evident in the fourth quarter versus go forward. Is there any way to kind of define what you and the Board are talking about both the right size of your run rates relative to the volumes, because clearly you're trimming some areas of the portfolio. And in particular, is pruning still the right word or are you doing something a little beyond what that word suggests?","VernNagel","So, Chris, I think pruning is the right word. When these tariffs came through, they really created a great deal of turmoil within global supply chains, and so many of us in the industry had to evaluate where we played and why we put forth price increases. To help offset that, we took other actions to mitigate component cost increases to mitigate finished goods price increases. But to the extent that we were able or unable to get full capture on pricing in some channels, we made the decision to review that portfolio and understand where we needed to play and why.","As I pointed out, our Contractor Select portfolio grew very, very nicely in Q4. And it's targeted directly at what we'll call a competition for that basic, lesser featured end of the market which is an important market to us. But there are certain channels where we feel we did not realize the type of financial profile that we're after. So we began to, if you will prune those products and assess which products we could mutually benefit both our customers as well as our shareholders in terms of profit margin. So when we think about our business going forward, the turmoil that has been created in two ways, the price increases have created pull forwards almost illogical [ph] distortions of the market, of people trying to avoid those price increases.","So it's going to make it very difficult. It made it very difficult in 2019 to really understand period-over-period growth what was truly happening in the market. And we think that 2020, at least for the first half will be exacerbated by the same types of things. We also have a little bit of noise around the fact that we had a load in of certain customers within the retail channel. So that -- there's just a lot of noise around this. This is why again we don't normally give guidance, we attempted to provide some guidance to the best of our ability by saying that we think that our topline will be impacted by mid to upper single-digit decline in the first quarter of 2020 compared to 2019.","I also said that we expect for the full year to show positive growth. So, we're trying to balance off market dynamics with our own ability to drive opportunistic share gain in the marketplace. I think that the profitability improvement that you saw in the fourth quarter is reflective of the actions that we have taken to both protect our business and to grow our business. So, you saw the margin improvement at the adjusted gross profit level of about 320 basis points. We were able to leverage that to about 90 basis points at the adjusted operating profit level.","So I think you have some reasonable information and insights around margin profile, and I think that some of the commentary that we made around first quarter as well as what we expect for the first year growth to also be helpful to you in modeling.","ChristopherGlynn","Yes. Congrats on the gross margin, and the free cash flow improvement noted as well. Just building up the last comments of the margin, you did build some momentum through the year on margins, but clearly most pronounced in the fourth quarter here, seemingly a springboard as the components of it seem to be from structural shifts as you've evolved a few things during the year. So, is that a pretty clear setup for favorable tailwind full-year margins fiscal 2020 comparing to the year just ended?","VernNagel","I think we should. We expect that we will see favorable margin comparisons in 2020 to 2019, but we expect that to be for the full year. So, if I could encourage everyone to not obsess over each quarter, we expect that the full year will be favorable. It's also very interesting to note, and I just wanted to point out again that the un-absorption or the under absorption of fixed manufacturing this quarter was almost $10 million. In the year ago period, the under absorption was almost $5 million. So, when we think about how we're structuring our business and how we're managing that, we did a great job this year in managing our inventory levels down, improving our service, and you saw that in our tremendous cash flow. Part of that tremendous cash flow was the collection of receivables for the load end of the year ago period. ","But we've done a great job managing our balance sheet, and I expect that we will continue to see positive margin improvement in 2020 over 2019.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","DeepaRaghavan","Hey, good morning. Vern, Karen, welcome. Just dovetailing on that margin improvement question. Vern, can you talk about the drivers to the margin improvement in fiscal 2020? I mean you mentioned all these actions which I guess it's pretty comprehensive, but can these actions lead you to say, I'm just throwing a number out there, 41% gross margin improvement for the full year irrespective of volume performance. I guess that's the big question for me. How do we think about your resiliency in a weak volume environment? And on the flip side, how do I think about pricing? Because that was a big help to margins this time. If tariff were to ease, I mean will import competition pick back up and start to pressure margins again? So, yes, two sides of the coin sorry, if you will, I'd appreciate. ","VernNagel","Sure. Channel mix was a significant driver to our improvement in margin. So as we ramped up or as our sales through our independent sales network primarily the C&I market that became a larger percentage of the total sales in Q4 relative to the total percentage that retail or sales through the retail sales channel were. So that shift in channel mix had a meaningful improvement on the gross profit margin. I would like to point out and I think it's really important, if you were to look at again the change in our operating profit between periods excluding the unabsorbed overhead, it was a decline of $5 million on a drop of almost $123 million of sales.","So I think what shareholders should take from Acuity is that we are managing our business and our portfolio well to both optimize our profit, but also to optimize our profitability and to return back that cash ,if you will, in the form of great cash flow. Because we have de-levered some of our exposure into some of those markets. From a growth perspective going forward from a margin perspective, I'm not going to prognosticate or give guidance around that. What I will say is that we expect the mix of our business to continue to a degree as it is or as we reported in Q4. And that should have a favorable impact on gross profit margins. The notion of the volume and demand in the marketplace to your question is really important.","We still expect that the first quarter or market conditions which will impact our first quarter to still be sluggish. Order rates I think in the near term continue to be a challenge. I think there's a lot of economic uncertainty out there. So we're looking to not only have issues that, not issues but they have items that will impact our first quarter compared to the year ago period, attempting to quantify that we gave you some insights as to what we think the top line is going to be. And we'll have to manage our SDA accordingly. But for the full year, we would expect there to see a positive improvement.","I think a number of the forecasts that I see out there are calling for growth in 202. But those same forecasters are saying that they expect the back half of calendar year 2019 to continue to be flat maybe even slightly down. I find it to be very interesting when I look at a number of indicators. As you might imagine we collect all sorts of data. And that data has historically been given us insight into the future. And just a couple that I would point out to everyone. When we look at, for example, the industrial market or the commercial office market, vacancy rates are at a significant low. And you see rising rents in both of these areas. Typically that would instigate investment in the area.","I personally believe that there's a lot of money sitting on the sidelines waiting to get clarity around some of these economic issues that will begin to attack this. I mean these rising rents, when people look at that given the interest rate environment, I think it's a very positive opportunity. So I have a cautiously optimistic view of what the future holds. I just think that the shorter term is going to continue to have turmoil because of some of these economic uncertainties.","DeepaRaghavan","Got it. Thanks for the color. I think a follow-up to the same question that we're talking about it. So let's just say the tariffs rate to ease a little bit here. When do you expect kind of bulk of these projects that we're talking about that are on the sidelines come back online pretty quickly? And I mean generally how do we think about election year actually throwing in some uncertainty on top of it. I appreciate that and that will be my last question for the call. Thank you. ","VernNagel","Sure. Thank you. So our many sales forces continue to see an experience, if you will, record backlogs which is their projects aren't releasing. And I think because of uncertainty around cost many of these projects are --they're years in the making. They're not one month and so therefore when they decide that they're going to build a commercial office building that's going to take two years from start to finish to come into place, they're trying to project their cost. So the uncertainty of tariffs has a meaningful impact on when they say go.","I think as we get clarity around those things, you're going to see more of those projects come to fruition. Architects and engineers even though the architectural billing index has softened up a little bit here continue to be very busy. We don't hear of anyone laying people off. So we still think that there's good activity out there. To the extent that our price capture has really gone mostly to offset the tariff increase, so to the extent that tariffs start to abate for whatever reason. I think that you might see some of the pricing readjust. But in our perspective, it's been a -- it's been kind of a cost neutral. So I wouldn't expect us to see any significant profit profile change because of that. Other than we would expect to see volume growth which is hugely beneficial for Acuity because we have a very solid variable contribution margins on an incremental sales dollar of growth.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","BrianLee","Hey, guys. Good morning. Welcome, Karen. Thanks for taking the questions. First one, maybe just on the volume growth, maybe drilling down a little bit, I know there's a lot of moving parts here heading into 2020, Vern, but on new construction volumes, can you kind of give us a sense of where you think those are tracking at? I know in past quarters seem like you guys have been mentioning sort of down low single digits. So, if you could maybe update us as to how the trend in that particular vertical is looking right now?","VernNagel","Sure. So, again, we're not economists, but when we look at information, I think the US Census Bureau does it well. On inflation adjusted basis, seasonally adjusted, the overall market for electrical lighting equipment, it's been down like eight of the last nine quarters. On inflation adjusted basis, when we look at some of the other items, non-resi has kind of been on the decline here, whereas non-residential -- I'm sorry, I meant to say resi, has been down, non-residential has been flattish to slightly down. I think what's been propping up a lot of stuff has been public non-residential.","So we continue to see an environment that is, again, I'll call it sluggish, with a lot of larger projects remaining on the sidelines in people's backlogs not being released. One positive thing that I think is important is the fact that when we look at the Dodge Momentum Index, while it was declining, starting in kind of middle 2018, it seems to have flattened out. So I think that when we look at the overall market, we continue to see new construction on an inflation adjusted basis to be flat to slightly down for those folks in that portion of the industry that have non -- say, deflationary items, unlike the lighting industry, they're probably actually showing some growth.","BrianLee","Okay. Now that's fair enough. Helpful. And then, just second question here, and I'll pass it on. I know you've done this in past quarters as well, clearly some company specific issues for you guys are doing the compare here. But how would you say you compare to the industry growth rate during the quarter? And then, I know you traditionally don't give the guidance but you're giving guidance if you want, what are you expecting kind of the baseline to be for that quarter? And really the reason I ask is, there has been a few quarters here now where you've under-performed the market it would seem, so trying to gauge when you think in fiscal 2020, you sort of get back to the historical trend of being able to outgrow the market.","VernNagel","Yes. So if I look at the overall growth rate of the market, as I just commented, the market for the last, again, seven, eight quarters has been down anywhere from 1.5 to almost 4 points on an inflation adjusted basis. So Acuity's growth during each of those quarters or performance against that still has outperformed the overall growth rate of the market. I think we've had a couple of things here that are specific to Acuity. When we decided to again look at our portfolio and determine the profitability of those items relative to what our expectations are. Yes, we did take some actions that were specific to Acuity around those products in certain channels.","But when I look at overall C&I, which is the non-residential portion of our world, sold through agents commercial and industrial, I would say that our performance there is still positive relative to the market. Some of the lumpiness that we've seen in our corporate accounts world has been more due to the timing of releases. As you know, Acuity was the vendor of choice to relight all of the target locations, and we've completed that. And we have expanded our customer base to now add many, many additional customers, not all of whom have moved as quickly or as large as Target. So we're having, if you will, some lumpiness, it's what I call it. But yet our expansion and the amount of footprint that we cover with our connected lighting Atrius-enabled solutions continue to grow at a formidable rate.","And now, we're expanding that capability into other verticals. So when I look at Acuity's growth and I compare it to the market, I'm looking at various channels and I'm looking at various segments of the market. And where we have participated in the same way, we continue to believe that we are either maintaining or growing market share. When we look individually, for example, at our lighting controls solutions, we believe we are gaining significant market share. When we look at Contractor Select, it went from being really a very small portfolio less than 18 months ago to now almost 10% of our total revenues. And we like the profit margin capabilities off of that. That growth has come in the C&I channel primarily. So I think we are well balanced, positioned well to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve, and to the extent that there is business out there that we feel is not mutually beneficial. We're not afraid to look for other channels to serve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities. Your line is now open.","JosephOsha","Hello. Thanks and welcome, Karen. I have two questions. First, when we think about this free cash flow, which is formidable, and if we were to look forward 12 months and maybe sort of think about how that pie is segmented between additional acquisitions and buybacks, I'm wondering how you're thinking about that free cash flow deployment.","And secondly, not to harp on, I think the point everyone has been harping on, but it seems to me that you could have grown this business more and taken, call it, a 40% gross margin in the fall through to the operating line probably would have been better. At what point does that top-line growth begin to become more important than moving this gross margin higher than where it is now?","VernNagel","Sure. So, Karen, maybe you take the first question on cash flow, and then I'll answer the second.","KarenHolcom","Sure. Historically, we have spent about a third on acquisitions, a third on share purchases and a third on CapEx and dividends. So I think we're always looking for ways to optimize shareholder value, and surely share repurchases and acquisitions and dividends and CapEx are part of that. So I think that's where you'll see the use of our cash flow over the next year.","JosephOsha","So no change really in terms of that?","KarenHolcom","Correct, no change. Yes.","VernNagel","And I would say that we continue to be opportunistic. We have a very robust pipeline of acquisitions. We just completed the acquisition of The Luminaires Group. We continue to look at not only traditional lighting businesses to complement our portfolio, but also really interesting technologies to complement our connected lighting Atrius-enabled solutions. So I want to tell everyone, we are making really solid progress in implementing our strategy around Atrius in the connected lighting space. I wish that the SaaS revenues could start to meaningfully move the top-line that has a $3.7 billion business. It's still in its early stages, but it's really encouraging.","To your second question on top-line growth and letting the margins flow through, I really think it's important that when you do your analysis of Acuity's results that you consider again the $123 million change in year-over-year growth or decline in top-line and yet on an adjusted basis, excluding the unabsorbed overhead in both periods, it impacted our profitability by a drop of only $5 million. So I think Acuity is really focused on growing its top-line to in fact grow its bottom line and improve our profitability.","But the news and the actions that we've taken to adjust our portfolio, I think, are really in the best interest of our shareholders and that free cash flow was really powerful, and it shows you the power of Acuity. So we balance off how do we have profitable growth in the definition around that. And we define profitable growth at Acuity based on the returns. Our return on invested capital this year was 18%, 800 bps greater than our weighted average cost to capital.","We look at other things like cash flow return on investment. It was almost 35% this year. Our returns are robustly huge. Having said that, we are about growth, and I think 2020 to get growth, it's going to be about market share gains in every channel that we focus on.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","JohnWalsh","Hi. Good morning. Maybe following on that market share gains question, some of the levers there that are going to allow you to do that, obviously the DLC, very important for kind of incentive programs at utilities, I think they're coming out now or just talked about higher, more stringent qualifications to get those. And the terms they're using are controllability and quality of light, which should fit very well with your product portfolio. Is that something that can actually be meaningful? Is that a help to kind of the Tier 1 domestic OEMs versus the imports coming from overseas?","VernNagel","I think it's a huge impact or can have a huge impact. DLC is very important in terms of what they require. And so companies that are really focused on quality of light, who have invested significantly in understanding what controls mean. It's not just saying, I can dim a light or turn a light on or off, it's really how does it work in space? And too often these lesser quality suppliers, people experience tremendous flicker. And so the experience that one has in that space is not good. As DLC points, there are significant influence toward quality of light as well as competitive cost. I think it's going to benefit those manufacturers that have really invested in quality of life. So, yes, I do -- I think it will have an impact.","JohnWalsh","And then maybe just another question around the free cash flow, and just thinking about the inventory dynamics. I mean, last year you missed kind of that 100% conversion that we typically use as a benchmark. This year, you kind of over-drove that. I mean, how should we think about the free cash flow conversion rate going forward? Is there still any kind of working capital goodness as we think about our next year free cash flow number?","VernNagel","Yes, it's a great question. So our objective is to, as you point out, have free cash flow in excess of net income. This year, coming up may be a slight challenge, I think as Karen pointed out, we're expecting to spend between 1.7% and 1.8% on CapEx. That's slightly higher than our depreciation. So -- but just note that as a fact, I think from an operating working capital perspective, we're probably right now doing this from memory about 13% of sales, maybe even slightly higher than that. I think our total days -- our net days are about 56 or 57 days. We brought our payables down probably a little bit further than what we normally would expect. So I would think that our total days will come down from an operating, working capital perspective. We're at about 56 or 57 days for inventory. We have areas to improve there. Our teams are doing a great job.","It really depends on what percentage of our business is coming from offshore into North America as we look to really drive the performance of our supply chain here in the North American market. We see opportunities to improve our inventory days. So I think you should expect from Acuity a continuation of attempting to meet that goal of 100% conversion of net income to cash flow.","Operator","Our next question comes from line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","TimothyWojs","Hey, guys. Good morning. Two quick ones for me. I guess first on the under-absorption, Vern, would you expect that to continue into the first quarter, just given the revenue guidance? That's one. And then second, how should we think of just leverage of SD&A in fiscal 2020? I think you did leverage SD&A a little bit in fiscal 2019, if you expect modest growth in the top-line in 2020, should we expect SD&A to grow similarly or can it actually maybe be flat to down?","VernNagel","So, on the absorption issue, we would expect there to be probably some negative or under-absorption in Q1 versus the year ago period. I haven't done any analysis to know how much that will be. It really depends on the order rate and our ability. We know we can service your order, right. But how is that order rate going to manifest itself. Orders continue to be somewhat sluggish, so we do see some bright spots. And we hear encouraging words. Words don't mean much, orders mean everything. So, we'll focus on that. But yes, I think you will see a bit of unobserved overhead, not to the significance of what was in Q4, where that number was $10 million in the year ago period of Q4, it was $5 million. I think you'll see a smaller number less than both of those, but I don't know that factually.","On your SDA question, so here's the challenge, as you might imagine. We're trying to manage SDA and all costs, not just SDA, but all costs, all of our spend in a way that allows us to be consistent with what the demand is in the current period, but also holding out knowing that we have an expectation that there'll be future improvements in demand. So we're trying to balance off all of those things. As I mentioned, we have a couple of warehouses that we were able to shut down and consolidate, so we could reduce our cost. But we continue to look at all aspects of our business to drive further leverage. We prefer to get the leverage because we have top-line growth, but we will manage our fixed cost structure and our variable cost structure based on the environment that we find ourselves in.","Our headcount is down approximately 9% on a year-over-year basis. So we've had to manage our business while experiencing these huge spikes, and then -- in orders because of people trying to avoid price increases and then boom. The volume or the business falls off. So it's been quite a challenge to manage, but our expectation is to further leverage our SDA. Our costs are up because of wage inflation. It's been a tight labor market out there. And so, we'll continue to experience those. We have made some investments in some areas, but we've also de-invested in some other areas. So, we will -- I think, Dan, we finished the quarter at about 26.5% SDA as a -- I have it here some place.","TimothyWojs","Yes. Correct.","VernNagel","So 26.5%, but I think the bigger or the more important aspect of it is what will the spend dollars be. We could see a little bit of an increase. It just depends on what the drop off in volume is going to be in Q1, knowing that we have -- we're carrying a little bit more expense from Q4 into this coming Q1 compared to what occurred last year. So probably have a little bit of a challenge there in Q1, but I think for the full year, we will -- you will see leverage in our total fixed cost opportunities.","End of Q&A","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning. Again, we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that have the potential over the longer term, to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","C. Dan Smith","Good morning. With me today to discuss our second quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at www.acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risk and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. Overall, we are quite pleased with our results for the second quarter, particularly given the challenging market conditions and the continued complexities associated with the Cochran closure. With that said, we feel we delivered solid results while achieving success on numerous strategic priorities.","You will recall from our previous calls and filings, we expected market demand in the first half of our fiscal year to be soft and inconsistent. As independent market data became available for our first fiscal quarter, it confirmed the economic slowdown we anticipated, which carried into our second fiscal quarter.","The result was inconsistent demand this quarter, as well as, but a lesser -- but to a lesser degree. However, in spite of this variability, we achieved meaningful sales volume growth. In fact, this quarter was our 12th quarter in a row of sales volume growth. I believe this is, yet again, positive evidence our strategy to diversify the end markets we serve and to extend our leadership position in North America is succeeding. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity.","As we noted in our last conference call, we expect to continue to outperform the markets we serve and to deliver full year results in 2013, more consistent with our longer-term financial goals as noted in our 10-K. Remember, these goals represent upper quartile performance.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later. But I would like to make a few comments on the highlights for the quarter.","Net sales for the quarter were almost $487 million, an increase of 6.3% compared with the year-ago period. This level of growth was significant, given general economic and industry conditions. Reported operating profit was $45.1 million. We took a special charge in the current quarter for previously announced streamlining actions and incurred temporary inefficiencies associated with the Cochran plant closure, which, in total, reduced the operating profit by $3.1 million.","The year-ago period also had special charges totaling $6.6 million for this and other activities. Ricky will talk more about these special charges and the temporary inefficiencies later in the call.","We find it helpful to add back these items to both quarters' results to make them comparable. Doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit was $48.2 million, compared with $45.6 million, an increase of 6%, while adjusted operating profit margin was approximately 10%, essentially the same as in the year-ago period.","Diluted earnings per share were $0.57. Again, adding back the impact of the items noted above in both quarters, adjusted diluted EPS for the current quarter was $0.62, compared with $0.57 in the year-ago period, an increase of almost 9%.","There are a number of key items to note regarding the results for the second quarter. While net sales grew 6.3% compared with a year ago, sales volume grew more than 9% this quarter. This level of sales item growth was particularly noteworthy, given the overall market conditions mentioned earlier. The difference was primarily due to changes in channel mix, as well as the mix of products sold, and to a lesser degree, lower pricing on like-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline of certain LED component costs.","The impact of acquisitions and foreign currency on net sales was not significant. From a product perspective, while the growth in net sales was reasonably broad-based along many product lines, the increase in net sales was influenced by larger renovation projects, particularly for national retail customers, as well as growth in the commercial and industrial and home improvement channels. In fact, we believe some of the larger renovation projects were a carryover from delays in these projects noted in our first quarter earnings call. This catch-up, if you will, skewed both our product and channel mix from that more typical of a second quarter, which is normally our softest quarter.","The mix of products sold on these larger renovation projects tend to have a lower gross profit profile than our overall average margin. We also experienced a higher mix of value-oriented products sold through certain channels, which tend to have a lower-than-average margin profile as well. The change in both product and sales channel mix were the primary contributors to a consistent adjusted gross profit margin this quarter compared with a year ago, in spite of strong top line growth this year.","Sales growth on our largest channel, commercial and industrial, was slightly above this quarter's overall percentage increase in net sales, due to continued emphasis on selling higher value-added lighting solutions, especially LED luminaires, which again grew by almost 2.5x compared with the year-ago period, as well as continued focus on smaller- and medium-sized projects of various types.","Additionally, we enjoyed growth in our residential products, as demand for new housing and renovation of existing homes continued to rebound, helping to offset some of the softness in certain portions of the nonresidential market.","We continue to experience growth in most geographies and channels in North America, all of which is encouraging, though this was somewhat offset by the continued weakness in Europe.","Excluding LED luminaires, we believe the puts and takes for product pricing, as well as material component costs, were again fairly benign this quarter.","Looking at overall market conditions for the second quarter, we believe spending in key segments of the U.S. nonresidential construction market was slightly positive compared with a year ago. Further, we believe the overall lighting market was up low mid-single-digits during the same period, supported by growth in renovation, as well as the residential market. This is in stark contrast with our sales volume growth in North America, which was up over 9%.","We believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces allowed us to achieve meaningful value growth this quarter in spite of these challenging market conditions.","Lastly, we believe there was further evidence this quarter, such as improvements in the Architecture Billings Index and other leading indicators, that demand in construction for building should improve over the next several quarters. As you know, there is a lag in the construction cycle between design and ultimate purchase of lighting fixtures and controls.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and the strategic accomplishments in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the special charge in the temporary inefficiencies associated with the plant consolidation, adjusted operating profit margin for the second quarter was approximately 10% or essentially flat with the year-ago period. This is particularly noteworthy, given that sales of LED luminaires now make up almost 15% of our total net sales.","Further, as Ricky will discuss later in the call, adjusted gross profit margin was 39.6%, essentially flat compared with the prior year. We believe the expected benefits from the higher sales volume were offset by a meaningful shift in the product and sales channel mix, as noted earlier.","The mix shift was primarily due to the influx of larger renovation projects, which tend to have a lower margin profile as compared with, for example, fixtures sold through specifiers within the C&I channel.","Also, as noted earlier, we experienced a greater mix of value-oriented products sold through certain channels. The impact of products and sales channels mix was partially offset by lower material and component costs, as well as productivity improvements associated with our ongoing streamlining activities.","While our gross profit margin is influenced by sales volume and overall mix, we expect our gross profit margins to continue to improve as volume grows, channel mix returns to historical norms, and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","The slight decline in gross profit margin was offset by a similar improvement in selling, distribution and administrative expenses, which were 29.6% of net sales this quarter.","Total SD&A expenses were $144.3 million, up about 6% this quarter compared with the year-ago period, primarily to support the growth in sales volume this quarter.","On the strategic front, we continued our rapid pace of introductions of new products, significantly expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions.","As I mentioned earlier, our solid-state lighting portfolio is expanding rapidly, as are the sales of these luminaires. Today, approximately 15% of our net sales are from LED luminaires. And we continue to fund the development of holistic lighting solutions for specific applications, such as schools, health care facilities and commercial office buildings, to fully leverage our award-winning portfolio of lighting fixtures, controls and components.","More impressively, as I noted earlier, our adjusted operating profit margin continued to remain solid, while sales of LED-based solutions are a growing portion of our overall business.","Acuity is the clear leader in digital lighting solutions. It's because we understand lighting and the sophisticated needs of our expansive customer base and are able to offer each tailored solutions from our industry-leading portfolio.","As I have noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during eras of technology disruption. Today is clearly no different. Acuity Brands is leading the evolution to intelligent lighting solutions, with its broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor solid-state and traditional energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls. And we are delivering profitable growth and strong financial returns for our shareholders, while making these important investments.","Our formidable strength in innovation was on full display this quarter, as Acuity received the prestigious 2013 Technology Brand Leader designation and won 6 LED lighting product honors from the Architectural Solid-State Lighting Product Innovation Awards for its indoor and outdoor LED lighting solutions, significantly outpacing our competition. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2013 and beyond. Ricky?","Richard K. Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight a few items regarding our income statement, including the special charge and production inefficiencies related to our streamlining activities. I then will discuss our cash flow and financial condition before turning the call back to Vern.","Vern covered the primary drivers for our sales growth and our profitability, so I'll not repeat these items, but I would like to provide a bit more color on certain aspects of our second quarter results.","Let's first look at our streamlining activities. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we recognized a pretax special charge and temporary expenses related to the previously announced streamlining actions, totaling $3.1 million or $0.05 per diluted share. The pretax special charge was $0.3 million, related primarily to the costs associated with the transfer of production due to the closure of the Cochran facility.","In addition to this special charge, we incurred $2.8 million of higher pretax costs related to temporary manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the closing of this facility, consisting primarily of expenses associated with the initial set-up of production at various facilities that have accepted the production of products previously manufactured at the Cochran facility, and nonproductive operating costs at the Cochran facility, which ceased when the plant closed during our second quarter.","As Vern said earlier, we find it useful to adjust our results for these items to make them more comparable, and we have included in our earnings release a full reconciliation of our GAAP amounts to these adjusted results.","The closure of the Cochran facility began in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. And as we mentioned previously in our 10-K and 10-Q and prior earnings conference calls, the timing of completing the transfer and closing the facility was dependent on how quickly we could receive the necessary government permits and approvals.","Due primarily to delays in receiving the necessary government permits and approval, it has taken longer to complete and has cost more than we originally expected. We are principally complete with the closure as of the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. We expect to incur an additional pretax special charge and temporary production inefficiencies of approximately $1 million associated with this closure during the third quarter of fiscal 2013.","We currently do not anticipate any further temporary production inefficiencies after our third quarter.","Annualized pretax savings associated with this closure are estimated to be approximately $8 million. You may recall, in addition to the streamlining activities for the Cochran closure, we also had other streamlining efforts in fiscal year 2012, which are yielding annualized savings of roughly $6 million. Therefore, we estimate that these streamlining actions, in total, will generate annualized pretax savings of approximately $14 million, or $3.5 million per quarter, of which approximately $1 million was realized in each of our second and third quarters of fiscal 2012, and approximately $2 million in each of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and first quarter of fiscal 2013.","We achieved the full quarterly savings run rate of approximately $3.5 million, excluding the temporary inefficiencies for all of these actions in this second quarter of fiscal 2013.","As Vern mentioned earlier, our adjusted gross profit margin of 39.6% was virtually flat compared with the year-ago period, on more than 6% increase in net sales, due largely to an unfavorable shift in both the mix of products sold and sales channels. This unfavorable mix shift was partially offset by the favorable impact of increased net sales, lower material and component costs and realized benefits from the previously mentioned streamlining actions.","Let's next turn our attention to some of our results below the operating earnings line. Miscellaneous expense is due primarily to the impact of exchange rates on foreign currencies, primarily Mexico peso-denominated items. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we had miscellaneous expense of $0.1 million, compared with miscellaneous expense of $1.1 million in the prior year period.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 33.6%, compared with 35.4% in the second quarter of last year. This lower effective tax rate was due primarily to the retroactive application of the research and development tax credit included in the American Tax Relief Act of 2012, which became law during our second fiscal quarter.","We estimate the effective tax rate for the full fiscal year 2013 will be approximately 35%. Now let's look at the cash flow for the 6 months ended February 28, 2013.","Cash flows used for operation in the first half of fiscal year 2013 was $0.3 million, compared with $37.6 million generated from operating activities in the prior year period. This decrease in cash flow from operating activities during the first 6 months of fiscal year 2013 was due primarily to an increase in account receivables, a decrease in accounts payable and the payment of prior year's accrued incentive compensation in the first quarter of this year.","Cash flow provided by operations in the second quarter of this year was $14.2 million, which is an increase of $4.3 million compared to the second quarter of fiscal year 2012.","In the first half of fiscal year 2013, we spent $21.9 million on capital expenditures, compared with only $9.4 million in the prior year period. This increase in expenditures is largely related to the capital associated with adding capacity in the plants, receiving the production transferred from Cochran, expansion of manufacturing capability in certain other locations, and tooling associated with a large number of new products recently developed.","We currently expect to spend approximately $40 million in capital expenditures in the full fiscal year 2013. This historically higher level of expected full year spending is influenced by approximately $5 million related to facility improvements to accommodate the closure of the Cochran facility and an additional $5 million related to the refurbishment of a furnace at the glass manufacturing facility, which is required approximately every 5 years.","At February 28, 2013, we had a cash balance of $262.8 million and total debt of $353.5 million. At the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2013, net debt-to-total capitalization was just over 9%. At February 28, 2013, we had additional borrowing capacity of $244.3 million under our credit facility, that does not mature until January 2017. So we continue to maintain a significant amount of financial flexibility.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities, even though short-term economic challenges are still the norm. While we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to add a few more observations to what I mentioned earlier regarding our expectations for the balance of 2013.","First, as we have noted before, while we expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging, we anticipate that businesses and consumers in the U.S. will accelerate their investments, as uncertainties over U.S. fiscal issues become clearer and the economy continues to improve.","Forecasts by independent organizations for industry growth continue to vary widely. The consensus is the growth rate for key segments of the nonresidential construction market for new construction in the U.S. will still be in the lower mid-single-digits in 2013, while sales for lighting fixtures are expected to be modestly higher, supported by renovation and retrofit activity, and a growing residential market. This suggests that expected growth in the broad lighting market in North America will be in the low- to mid-single-digit range for our fiscal 2013. This is reasonably consistent with our outlook in previous filings.","Additionally, as we noted earlier, there are other signs that give us optimism regarding future growth of our business. Leading indicators, such as Architecture Billings Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the rebound in residential construction are all favorable signs. Therefore, while we still expect to see some volatility in demand among certain sales channels and geographies, our expectation for the second half of fiscal 2013 is that over demand -- overall demand in our end markets will continue to improve and be more consistent and broad-based. The favorable trend in our March order rates reflects this improvement.","Second, the industry continues to experience some volatility with respect to input costs. While some commodity costs have waned recently, others continue to rise. As of now, we expect material input costs to be relatively flat, except for certain LED components, which should continue to decline.","Further, we expect employee-related costs will rise due to wage inflation and the negative impact of Obamacare on health care costs. Of course, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture and productivity efforts to help offset rising costs.","Additionally, as I've said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors, should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly, we expect to outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already-strong platform.","As I noted in our last several conference calls, our strategies to drive profitable growth remain intact. We continue to see opportunities in this environment, including benefits from growing portions of the market, further expansion in under-penetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the introduction of new lighting solutions.","As the industry leader in North America, we believe we are uniquely positioned with key suppliers around the globe to bring greater and more differentiated value to our customers, incorporating advanced technologies, providing superior lighting quality and more sustainable energy solutions.","Our product and solutions portfolios continue to expand rapidly, including the addition of 6 strategic acquisitions over the last few years. And we continue to add more. We recently announced the acquisition of eldoLED, a leader in the design and manufacture of high-performance intelligent drivers for LED-based lighting systems.","The acquisition of eldoLED, while small today in terms of revenues, is a meaningful addition to our growing portfolio of LED-based lighting solutions, an area of significant focus and growth potential for Acuity and its customers.","Our strategy is straightforward: Expand and leverage our industry-leading portfolio and solutions; coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities. This all takes focus and resources. We are funding these activities today because we see great future opportunity.","Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront. We continue to believe the many markets we serve, as part of the broader lighting industry, could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential.","As the market leader, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Scott Reynolds from Jefferies.","Scott Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","So quarter-over-quarter, we saw a decline of core business x LEDs and overall, the market is relatively slow there with the LEDs that's helping your overall growth rates. How -- have you guys seen a consolidation among some of the larger producers that are able to give resources towards LEDs? And are you seeing your overall market share increasing?","Vernon J. Nagel","Scott, this is Vern. I'll take the first cut at that, then I'll ask Ricky to comment. We look at the overall lighting market in its totality. Of course, LED, as a light source, is a growing component of the industry. But when we look at the total marketplace, again, we see low single-digit kinds of growth. But we see ourselves gaining share both in conventional light sources, as well as LED. So while you see our LED -- a portion of our business growing quite significantly, we expect that normal cannibalization to occur. But we're looking at the overall market. And as I said earlier in my prepared remarks, our expectation is that, that overall market, over the next few years, will see considerable growth because of improving demand, better technology allowing for paybacks through renovation. So from our perspective, we are offering our customers complete lighting solutions, whether it's a conventional light source, an LED light source, now coupled, part of -- as a holistic solution, not just combined with controls and things of that nature. So our two cents on it is that we're seeing LED growth. Our conventional business, while as a percentage of the total is declining, it's not declining anywhere near the rate as our LED business is growing. So we're showing overall sales volume growth, that I think is quite significant compared to where the market is. And we're doing that both in conventional, as well as our LED solutions business.","Scott Reynolds - Jefferies & Company, Inc., Research Division","And on that same note, on the conventional side, have you seen any additional pricing pressure with some of the legacy producers trying to maintain margins? And then on the LED side, how do you use your position, your considerable agent channel, to fend off some of the low-priced products that are coming into the market on the LED side?","Vernon J. Nagel","So with regard to conventional, so much of it is a project-by-project, channel-by-channel decision, whether it be competition, pricing, value-add capability. I don't think that we're seeing anything that is different than what we've experienced in terms of price competition on the conventional side. And LED is probably not terribly dissimilar, while component costs continue to come down and they vary all over the board, it depends really on application-specific, product-specific capability. It's still a competitive market, whether it's LED or conventional. And I don't know that there is a significant difference, from our perspective, between LED and conventional, from a competitive standpoint. We're all seeing prices decline on componentry. Eventually, that will begin to stabilize. When that happens, I don't know, 18, 24, 36 months from now. And then it will be based on the value-add of the solution that you provide. And again, our expectation is, is that ultimately, LED-based luminaires that have much more capability than, say, conventional luminaires will be a higher value-add component and will generate more favorable margins because of the capabilities that they'll have to offer so much more value to the end customer.","Operator","Our next question comes from Noelle Dilts from Stifel.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","My first question is, again, you had very nice volume growth in the quarter. Can you make an estimate, how much of that volume growth came from this deferral -- the deferred project volume to the quarter versus kind of a core improvement?","Vernon J. Nagel","It's a great question. And unfortunately, it would only be a guess. We know that projects, certain renovation projects, were deferred. To try and quantify that, I think, would be a bit of a challenge. The whole notion of renovation, particularly amongst the large retailers and other larger corporate-type accounts, continues because the payback opportunity provided by better, more efficient lighting is rather significant. So our expectation is that we'll continue to grow that business. Unfortunately, our second quarter, which is traditionally our softest, when these types of projects came through, fantastic for top line growth, but it did have an impact on our margin dynamics. I think if you look at the first half, you see that our overall gross profit margins were roughly 40%, a little bit influenced by more of this renovation. So to me, it's a little bit of a challenge to try to understand exactly how much was deferred, though we know some of it. Just to put a little bit more perspective on those types of activities, if you look at our net increase in revenues of roughly $30 million, between these types of accounts, as well as our business through the home center, it represented about 2\/3 of the growth. The rest of the growth came through our C&I channel and was actually even higher. But there, too, we had mix differences that were going on. Our sales volume growth was over 9% this quarter. So pretty robust along many, many fronts.","Noelle C. Dilts - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Okay. And this is to -- expanding on that, you have seen a sort of negative mix impact in over the past couple of 2 quarters. When you look forward? Do you see that changing as you move into the back half of the year? Or when you look at the increase in large orders, is it more of a continuation of the same?","Vernon J. Nagel","No, we do expect to continue this level of business and volume. But we expect the other portions of our business to now start to continue to grow at more consistent rates as these areas. And so, therefore, we are expecting, in the second half, a more traditional mix of business. So we would expect that with the volume, the traditional mix and continued efficiencies and productivity in our business, we would expect to see our gross profit margins start to expand back to more historical and expected levels.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Vern, just to dig into some of your comments around the volume outlook. You just did 9%, and it sounds like you expect overall demand to continue to improve. If we go back a quarter, I don't think double digits was even in the lexicon, really, for the medium-term outlook. So just wondering what the real drivers are to such an abrupt shift in the trend there.","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, again, our expectation is that the overall lighting market will grow, in our fiscal 2013, low- to mid-single-digit range. So the notion of double-digit growth really is Acuity outperforming the market that it serves, or the many markets that it serves. So I'd like to be clear around that point. Number two, this quarter, we were benefited by some delay and then carryover effect. It's difficult, as I mentioned in the previous question, difficult to precisely estimate how much that was. It was some. So the 9% growth was a bit of a make-up for some of the expected or the shortfall that we experienced in the first quarter. I think if you look at our overall first half, where we said we expected inconsistency and choppiness in the marketplace, it played out that way. But yet, when we look at the first half growth over the year-ago first half, I believe, Ricky, we were up, what, 4% or 5%. So that's fairly consistent with kind of what our view was. But our expectation for the second half is that we will continue to post some reasonably strong revenue growth, driven by sales growth, as well as share gains.","Richard K. Reece","Well, and I would just add, as Vern made in his -- mentioned in the comments, we are seeing some of the macro indicators, in the Architecture Billings Index, employment, vacancy rates, those types of things beginning to improve, not at rapid rates and not always consistent month-to-month, but are seeing indications that if the economy continues to show this slow recovery here in North America, that we'll benefit from a stronger market in the second half than what we had in the first half.","Vernon J. Nagel","And Chris, we are also expecting and seeing some of the investments that we have made over the last few years starting to contribute to our growth. And as we get into the second half of our year, it's typically when we start to see things like schools and commercial office buildings and other types of business, where the mix is a little bit richer because of the value-add of the products and solutions that we sell into that. So we're expecting kind of 1-2 punch of a better mix of products, as well as this economy and the demand for space and lighting and so on and so forth starting to improve. And our expectation is that renovation will continue to be a source of growth for Acuity and for the industry.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. So the spirit of your -- I appreciate the color, by the way. The spirit of the comment on a pick up might have been more on the second half versus -- of first half comment than versus 2Q rates?","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes. Again, as Ricky points out, we think that there is leading indicators that would suggest that the overall demand will start to become more consistent, more broad-based and more favorable. I still think that the overall, for our fiscal 2013, when we look at the market, I believe that, that kind of low mid-single-digit range is probably reasonable. And again, Acuity would expect -- we expect to outperform the markets we serve.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert W Baird.","Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","This is Josh Chan filling in for Pete. So with respect to your comments about the higher mix of value-oriented products, can you give us a little bit more color on that? And particularly whether that's due to the market or your strategy? Or is that simply a normal fluctuation in your view?","Vernon J. Nagel","I believe that it's more of a normal fluctuation. Different channels have different profit dynamics to create our overall average. When we serve products or projects that have a more rich mix of the entire portfolio of products that we're able to provide, we tend to see our margins improve. When a project is a single fixture type and it's in a certain channel, such as doing renovation for large retailers, the margin profile on those types of projects tend to be less than our overall average, just reflecting the competitiveness of that space.","Joshua K. Chan - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, great, that makes sense. And then my second question is on the price declines of LED luminaires. I mean, obviously, as the component prices decline there's reason to believe that fixture prices should decline as well. But I was wondering if you're seeing any pressure that's sort of beyond the natural pressure, if you will. Any unnatural price pressures caused by either new entrants or certain competitors that you're seeing in the LED space?","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes, I can't really comment on the pricing strategy of all of our competitors. It's very much, and I think it's consistent with the way the industry has been, it's very much a channel-specific, project-specific, piece of business-specific opportunity around what are going to be the pricing dynamics into that space. And for those competitors who really have only price as their point of differentiation, it probably is a challenge for them. That doesn't mean that we're not insensitive to what pricing in the market, but we work very diligently to add value beyond just the price of a component or a solution. We really try to sell the fulsomeness of what Acuity provides as part of that overall capability. And so therefore, we are looking to differentiate, based on the fulsomeness of our value proposition, not just price. Be clear, the markets are always competitive, the various channels, the various end customers, it's a competitive market. And whether it's conventional lighting solutions or it's LED-based solutions, we see that same level of competitiveness throughout. And I would say that it's not materially inconsistent with what historical norms have been.","Operator","Our next question comes from Winnie Clark of UBS.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","My first question is, in terms of the increased spending you've seen on new products, how should we think about that going forward? Is that something that will become a tailwind at some point? Or have we seen a bit of a structural shift where you'll have a more elevated level of spending going forward relative to historical norms on new products?","Vernon J. Nagel","I would say that we probably are at a fairly consistent level. I mean, the cadence that the organization is producing products is formidable, and the investment that we have, infrastructure to support that, is pretty consistent. We just acquired 2 fantastic businesses, both very small, Adura, as well as eldoLED. These businesses have fairly de minimis revenues compared to our overall portfolio. But yet, their capability and what they can bring, and will bring, and are bringing, in terms of broader solutions will allow us to, I think, leverage future sales. So spending feels to us like it's kind of in a consistent range. We may see a little bit of uptick in some of our commissioning because these products are very high -- high value add. But I think overall, we're probably in a pretty consistent range. It's now really leveraging the top line to help drive that, as well as continuing to drive productivity throughout our organization. As Ricky pointed out earlier, we're getting the consolidation of the Cochran facility behind us. And I think you'll start to see us continue to drive that level of improvement and productivity that we are known for, that should also be contributory to improved gross margins going forward.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, back to the LED pricing pressure that you saw. And then, to what degree was that offset by the declining input cost? So in other words, how should we think of the impact of the lower prices on margins for LEDs versus what you've seen over the last couple of quarters?","Vernon J. Nagel","So again, great question. The issue for us is it's very product specific and then channel specific. We have said in the past that our margins on our LED portfolio are within the range of our conventional lighting. And that still is true. But again, it's very, very product specific. So as we respond to market level pricing, but we also respond to the value proposition that we bring, looking to differentiate and extract more value at higher price for what we deliver. So as we think about pricing in the marketplace, we're trying to make sure that we're protecting the margins that we believe we deserve for the type of value that we bring to the table. So as that pricing for components continues to decline, our sense is, is that it finds its way back into the market, typically, in terms of lower selling prices. But yet, it's virtually impossible to categorize it as -- in a very general light. You have to be very specific about channel, product and value.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities.","Unknown Analyst","This is Deepak Raj [ph in for Rich Kwas. My first question is on your order trends. Could you talk to order trends within the quarter and particularly what happened in March? Did you see an uptick towards the second half, first half? Any commentary there is helpful.","Vernon J. Nagel","We believe that in the second quarter, our input rate was fairly consistent with the sales volume that we saw. Our backlog, first quarter -- or excuse me, second quarter of this year compared to second quarter last year was essentially flat. So you saw the nice uptick in volume. And from what we have seen so far in March, we would expect to continue to see a favorable year-over-year trend in order rates reflective of, again, what we believe are improving conditions in the overall marketplace.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. Was March second half weighted? Any color there at all? Or was it very consistent throughout the month or...","Vernon J. Nagel","Gosh, golly, to look at daily order rates and then trying to draw a conclusion from that is almost impossible. So we tend to look at months and then quarters. And I would say that -- and we typically try during this call to give some reflection of what we saw in our order rates for the month. So that someone can at least have some basis to say, what's the trend in the marketplace. And again, our March input was favorable compared to the year-ago period.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. My next question is expanding on previous sales questions, but I just want a different take on this. On the margins in LED, it just appears to me that if you're passing through the component cost decreases, your margins should actually increase, everything else equal. But what is happening there? How should we think about this? Is the pass through lesser than -- way of price? Is it lesser? Is the component cost benefit being passed through, is it lesser? Is the price more than the component cost benefit? Or what are the other dynamics that will actually affect the margins in the LED space? I mean, not just now but going forward to how do we think about that space?","Vernon J. Nagel","Sure. So generally speaking, LED luminaires are more expensive than their equivalent counterpart, than conventional lighting. And it varies across the map, depending on what type of application or product it is. But generally speaking, they're still higher. So as pricing of componentry comes down and as other -- or as all of us put that pricing back into the market, attempting to stimulate more demand, creating more value, not just on the fixture, but on the overall solution, pricing becomes more what is the value and use, what's the payback, what is the opportunity. So I would agree with you. And as I mentioned earlier, our expectation is that once component cost becomes somewhat at parity with its conventional counterpart for the same type of output, you're going to see a higher margin because the LED luminaire with our controls capability will allow for much more value add to the end customer, typically paid for through superior energy savings, again, based on how we manage the internal workings of an LED luminaire. So our expectation is that margin should improve over time. I think we are a ways off from that. In other words, a ways off from having the light engine from a conventional light source or luminaire be equivalent to what an LED light engine would be. I still think that the cost of those are quite a ways out. So -- or the price comparability, I should say, cost comparability. So I think it's still a bit of a time before we see that expansion of margin on LED-based luminaires. Ricky, do you have any additional comment on that?","Richard K. Reece","No, I would echo, not only do we see the potential, as LED becomes a bigger percentage of the market for a margin expansion as a result of all of the value add and the value proposition LED offers. Certainly, energy savings is one, but much lower maintenance costs, the ability to control for architectural purposes or for tuning wide [ph] so that you can productivity enhancements and so forth. All of these things suggest to us that people would be willing to pay for this added benefit that they're going to receive from this very controllable, very long life, very low energy consumption technology. And not just LED. We're obviously investing heavily in organic LED and as technologies move and, of course, the most recent acquisitions showed the investments we're making in wireless controls, as well as drivers that we think, here, you can put software, you can put capability. If you have a wireless control that's on an LED that cuts the installation cost substantially, then we would think you'd be able to sell that solution at a higher cost than you would be able to sell a wired solution. So again, we look at it all as a system and a solution of which as these systems and solutions become more mainstream, we should see an opportunity for that to enhance our margins.","Unknown Analyst","Okay. That's helpful. One quick clarification. So Cochran is behind us now. When you say principally complete, it's just done and there's only just one more million left, and then we only have savings to reap from here?","Richard K. Reece","That's correct. Finally, yes, the plant has been totally shut down. Actually, had an auction and sold off the last of the equipment. So -- and it's up for sale. If anybody's interested in a plant in southern Georgia, give us a call. We would certainly have a very nice facility we would love to sell. So that's totally shut down and actively being marketed for sale and the permitting issues and all are behind us. We're just now in these last few months of transitioning workforce and getting them up the efficiency curve through training and volume that we've moved in and so forth and do not expect any more inefficiencies after this $1 million estimate that we have for our third quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt McCall from BB&T Capital Markets.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So Vern, on the margin front, you talked about the second half, I think, being more consistent with historical levels. And I think you referenced some expected mix shift. I assume part of that mix shift is less renovation, more new. So that the question is, you referenced the ABI, several leading indicators, do you have any, maybe more tangible, evidence if it's actual project activity, RFPs, order rates on those longer term projects? Anything tangible we can talk about? And I'm really trying to get to the visibility into that back half mix shift.","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, Matt, I think you could look at sort of our historical trends as a way to look and use that as a platform, if you will, to create your models going forward. It is very typical of Acuity for our second half to be 52%, 53%, 54% of our annual revenues compared to the first half. And so I don't think that, that trend is going to -- it will continue. The other thing is, is that as you get into the third and fourth quarter, you typically have a more rich mix of business that are around projects, whether it's schools, so I think schools still are -- it's a challenging business right now because of state and local-type government funding and financing. But that's a good example of, again, a vertical that needs to have all of its work done before, if you will, September 1. So we historically have had a richer mix of business, as well as more volume in the second half. Our third and fourth quarters are typically our strongest quarters. So we're expecting that to continue. I want to be very clear. We like the renovation business. We work very hard to do an excellent job for our very large, if you will, corporate customers. We bring great value to them. But those projects tend to have a very narrow mix of products that go on to those projects as compared with a commercial office building. So when you see things like absorption and employment rates improving, all of those are typically very favorable leading indicators for a company like Acuity Brands, which really provides superior solutions into those types of applications. So when we look at both indoor, outdoor and the investments that we've made, whether, again, it's eldoLED, which is a fantastic company, and how it's allowing us to bring greater, more effective lighting solutions, we think that it gives us a leg up to really do well as these markets come back where we've had traditional strengths.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And okay. Okay. And we're now, Vern, I guess you haven't mentioned, this is controls. And I know that part of the overall solution and you don't break it out. But can you just talk about the -- maybe the percent of luminaire sales that now include some type of smart controls and -- again, I know you don't break it out, but maybe remind us of the margin opportunity there, what's the trajectory of the penetration of those smart controls in your sales as you build that bridge to a 50% growth rate a few years out?","Vernon J. Nagel","So when folks think about our LED luminaires, virtually every luminaire has a level of control capability in it, you have to control that luminaire. And a lot of the investments that we have made aren't really directed towards that. And I'll just comment on eldoLED. eldoLED is a superior dimming technology for LED capability. We are a customer of eldoLED, and that's how we came to know them. The ability to provide superior lighting solutions, architectural dimming, tunable light is -- that's what they do, and that's what Acuity is now going to do. And we're going to make those products, by the way, available to the industry because they're so fantastic. Anyway, coming back to the margin dynamics or, excuse me, around controls. It's not just controls in the luminaire, but controls of entire lighting spaces. We see that business growing meaningfully. If we look at what our nLight System is doing, again, very small today, but it's literally doubling every quarter in terms of its capability, obviously, from a very small base, but it's -- it allows us to really win jobs because of the overall holistic capability of what Acuity Brands can bring. And customers love it because it's all Acuity. If there's an issue, they know who is going to resolve it. There's no finger-pointing about, well, someone else made this component and someone else brought their software to do this. So who's at fault? It's a fantastic solution. So we see that business continuing to grow. When we acquired many of the businesses, we thought that they would double every 18 months. We have been reasonably on that track. A few quarters, we've had a blip or 2, here or there, only because, I think, 6 months to 12 months ago, Ricky, some of the renovation work slowed down and we sell a lot of our controls componentry into those spaces. We're very complementary with the large ESCOs. We sell a lot of product to them. So some of that business had ebb and flow, but we continue to see a positive trajectory for our overall controls capability.","Richard K. Reece","Then maybe just to add on that. Virtually, all of our LED products, which are now, as Vern indicated, almost 50% -- 15% of our sales have controls on it at some level, whether it's lumen maintenance that allows you to get the same lumen output over the life of the fixture, whether it's dimming capability, whether it's daylight harvesting or other types of capability that we're putting into that, whether the customer chooses to activate it today or it's latency in there and then they can activate it at a later date as they integrate a more holistic system in or integrate it into their building management system. So without being able to give you a specific, what percentage of our luminaires and all, as you see LED growing as a percentage of our sales virtually all of those have some level of control in it. And obviously, we control a lot of the traditional fixtures as well. And as we build out our control platform with these acquisitions, that gives us that many more opportunities to add those features to the products as the customer sees the value.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And Ricky, maybe just a follow-up on that. So when you talk about the renovation activity today and you compare it maybe to the pre-controls initiative, is the dollars -- the spend per square foot noticeably different now when you compare to previous projects? Maybe you can talk about some of these retailers? Are you seeing an increased adoption of controls in the buy?","Vernon J. Nagel","I wouldn't say -- again, it's project to project, if it's have big large retailer, you wouldn't necessarily see a meaningful shift. And in fact, most of the retail renovation we're doing is still traditional, still going to more energy-efficient fluorescent. We still have the LED conversion opportunity ahead of us. Obviously, occupancy sensors, those are becoming more a norm because the payback is so quick. So you're seeing a bit, but it's so project by project. I don't know that I'd want to make a broad statement on the trend.","Richard K. Reece","And Ricky, I would say in the renovation side, particularly on the industrial side, which is, again, a very fast-growing opportunity, there you're seeing many, many more luminaires with embedded controls because of how that space wants to be lit and how they use of those industrial spaces, particularly warehouses.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions I just want to understand a little bit more in terms of the gross margin side,  I just want to look at -- if I look at, going forward, when you talked about recovery in the gross margin side, how should we be thinking about the LED side, as well as the traditional side? And then I have a follow-up.","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, again, we provide gross margin on a consolidated basis. We don't really break out gross margin between conventional and LED. But let me say that our expectation, on a go-forward basis, is that we will realize a more historical mix in our second half than what we did, say, in this particular quarter. This quarter was skewed by larger renovation projects and, to a lesser degree, certain value-oriented products, which typically have a lower margin profile being sold through certain channels, whether it's C&I or home improvement. So as we expand into our second half, we would expect that the mix would be a more rich mix of our capability not -- I want to be clear about this, not because we would be selling less renovation, we would just be selling more of some of these other types of projects, which carry more traditionally higher mix of product.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Yes. Just as a follow-up, do you see any kind of incentives in the horizon, particularly in the LED side, that would really accelerate the adoption of lighting of LED-based lighting?","Vernon J. Nagel","I'll take a cut, then I'll let Ricky take a cut. There are still incentives, both at the federal level through tax credits, as well as at the state level through general utilities, to provide for the conversion of older, inefficient lighting to newer, efficient lighting. And it's not just the light source of LED. As Ricky pointed out earlier, conventional lighting, particularly very efficient fluorescent products also qualify because they can drive so much savings. This is why Acuity is agnostic to the light source, but very focused on providing a good\/better\/best value proposition into those verticals, into those channels, into those customers based on what their needs are. So I believe that there will continue to be the types of incentives that will encourage people to convert older, less efficient lighting to new, more efficient lighting. I also believe, this is just a personal belief, that in the next few years, we will see some type of government-mandated energy policy that will further drive the adoption of just more efficient lighting, both conventional, as well as LED.","Richard K. Reece","That was a comment I was going to add on while we're seeing a decline in incentives, not necessarily seeing an increase there, they're pretty broad-based already, but where we are seeing some growth is in the regulatory side, whether it's in the building codes, whether it's obviously the banning of the incandescent bulb over several years here in the U.S. And I agree with Vern, I think at a national level, we may see some form of an energy policy that will dictate some level of control, or some level of dimming and so forth. So I think the green movement, the sustainability movement, is growing and is very strong. And lighting is one of the largest consumers of energy, in both residential and commercial households. I think it's going to be a very much a focus around taking advantage of where technology, both on the light source side, as well as on the control side, to get these kinds of reductions and use of energy and cleaner energy. And I think we're going to see continued growth in the building codes, not only enacting more building codes, but more strict enforcement of the building codes that are out there, because virtually every state has some level of requirements already.","Operator","Our final question comes from Colin Rusch from Northland Capital Markets.","Colin W. Rusch - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Can you talk about what you're seeing from the LED providers in terms of evolving geometries? We know that [indiscernible] went into a smaller geometry, are you starting to see that from any other providers just yet?","Vernon J. Nagel","So the great news for Acuity is that we scour the globe looking for the best, most cost-effective, efficacious componentry that's available. And while I'm not expert on geometry and sizes of chips, I will tell you that the evolution of the technology and the leveraging of the investments that a lot of these very large folks that they will continue, will proliferate. And again, we buy from virtually everybody, but it's really very much specific to the application and the opportunity. So I would expect there to continue to the cost evolution and efficiency evolution, particularly as these things commoditize.","Richard K. Reece","We continue to send teams around the globe. We have a team in Asia, as we speak now, continuing to monitor the progress that each of the chip manufacturers are making in both high-performance, mid- and low-performance chips and are very eager to work with all of them as the value proposition makes sense in the application we're looking at.","Colin W. Rusch - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","But nothing so far in terms of material changes in geometry that you're seeing today, correct?","Vernon J. Nagel","Again, I would say that there are others out there who can answer that question far more effectively for you than me.","Colin W. Rusch - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay, perfect. And then just a value capture with a couple of these new technology acquisitions. Do you really see that the value capture being in a higher ASP? Or are you going to be able to design a fair amount of cost out of your systems with eldoLED technology or their indoor technology that you're bringing to the table now?","Richard K. Reece","It's a great question. We see it as an opportunity for both. And I'll just speak to eldoLED for a second here. Their capability to provide continuous dimming is unparalleled in the market. And to do it in a very cost-effective way is really their skill set. And we'll make those components available to the industry. So there's an opportunity for cost and benefit. The real opportunity for Acuity is to incorporate this type of technology, more fulsomely throughout its portfolio, so that we can bring capability to a broader market than exists today. Very high in architectural dimming, it's very expensive, and few people can really take advantage of it. With eldoLED, I believe Acuity is going to make tunable light much more mainstream and affordable, where we know in schools, it can enhance the learning experience. Where we know in health care, it can enhance the healing experience. So these types of investments, I think, will allow us to provide a very differentiated solution to end users, like health care, like schools, universities, commercial office buildings, and to make it user friendly. We understand how to use light, and we know how to make it user friendly. So I think that it gives us a real opportunity to expand how people use lighting in their space in a much broader way. So I think its two-fold: Cost, but it's also going to be capability, and that's pretty exciting.","Richard K. Reece","One other item I'd mention, eldoLED is the reason we've also made some international acquisitions in Canada with the international capabilities that the value proposition for us is expanding and being able to service other parts of the globe with the proper certified electronics. UL, obviously, is the primary certification that we look to here in North America. But CE, obviously, is prevalent in Europe and other parts of the world. eldoLED now brings us that CE certified driver that we can input into our fixtures and be more global and more opportunity to compete on that front and grow our market share in that way. So it's not only enhancing the capability, but expanding our ability to address the market.","Vernon J. Nagel","And I'll just further point out, as Ricky mentioned, the acquisitions of Pathway and Horizon and Renaissance and others have brought tremendous human capability. And these products are now hitting the markets. We're very excited to be at LIGHTFAIR because of what our customer base will see. But it's not -- it shouldn't lost on anyone that Acuity won the Technology Brand Leader designation from the architectural Solid-State Lighting Product Innovation Awards. We are leading this area. These acquisitions are a meaningful part of us being able to do these things.","Operator","I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon J.

Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now, let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you Dan. Good morning everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. Overall performance this quarter was solid, particularly against the backdrop of current market conditions, including a continued soft lighting market. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the third quarter of 2018.","Net sales for the quarter were $944 million, up almost 6%, compared with the year ago period. Reported operating profit was $105.9 million compared with $131.5 million in the year ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.80 compared with $1.90 in the year ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for special charges, as well as certain other add-backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods as Ricky will explain later in the call.","In adding back these items, one can see that adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2018 was $135.8 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $148.3 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin was 14.4%, a decrease of 220 basis points compared with the year ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.37, up 10% from the year ago period.","For the first nine months of the fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $301 million compared with $198 million provided in the year ago period. So far this year, we have spent $164 million for two acquisitions and $298 million to repurchase two million shares of our stock. In addition, as Ricky will explain later in the call, we entered into a new $800 million credit facility with our bank group on June 29 further enhancing our financial flexibility.","Looking at some specific details for the quarter. Net sales were a third quarter record, up almost 6% over the year ago period, driven by an increase in net sales volume of over 10% and an approximate 1% favorable impact from acquisitions and foreign exchange rates, partially offset by approximately 5% for unfavorable changes in product prices and the mix of products sold. We experienced sales growth in most channels and geographies. The largest contributors to the increase in sales volume was primarily driven by greater shipments of our Atrius-based luminaires to certain customers in key channels as well as growth in our infrastructure and utility channel and from certain high volume LED based fixtures with popular form factors, primarily for applications on smaller projects.","Sales of LED luminaires make up more than two-thirds of our total net sales which, as you know, includes the sale of non-fixture related products and solutions as well. Sales to our C&I channel were down slightly this quarter compared with the year ago period primarily for larger nonresidential projects, where demand remained soft. Further, overall net sales were impacted by unfavorable price and mix, primarily due to lower pricing on certain luminaires, reflecting increased competition primarily for more basic, lesser featured products and changes in both product mix, which included substitutions to lower priced alternatives and channel mix, which included declines in shipments to larger commercial projects noted earlier.","While it's not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in the price and mix of products sold, we estimate the impact to net sales this quarter was primarily due to changes in product prices for lesser featured products and product substitution and to a slightly lesser degree changes in channel mix. To combat these market forces, we continue to accelerate the expansion of our product portfolio to more effectively and profitably compete in that portion of the market, where features and performance are seemingly less important.","We relaunched our Contractor Select portfolio this quarter, which includes many new products incorporating certain attributes of differentiation, but at competitive price points that we believe will have great appeal to both the commercial pro and residential consumers for their new construction and renovation projects. With this expanded portfolio, we believe we can offer even more choices to customers served in these markets that would prefer our innovative, reliable and affordable Juno and Lithonia lighting branded solutions, compared with products offered by others. Based on information from various data collection and forecasting organizations, we believe overall market demand for lighting in North America was slightly positive this quarter, a welcome relief after several previous quarters of negative growth.","Our net sales growth of almost 6% stands in stark contrast to the overall growth rate of the luminaire market in North America. We believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to continue to gain overall share in the North American market this quarter, particularly against the current backdrop of a soft and price competitive market environment. As I noted earlier in the call, this is particularly true at certain key verticals, where demand for our Atrius enabled luminaires continues to grow.","Our profitability measures for the third quarter while solid, given the overall market conditions, were below prior-year performance. They were impacted by continued tepid demand in certain portions of the market and the impact from changes in price mix noted earlier. Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $135.8 million, down approximately 8% compared with the year ago period while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 14.4%, down 220 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period. The decrease in adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to the impact of price mix and gross profit margin and higher selling, distribution and administrative expenses, both in dollars and as a percentage of sales.","Adjusted gross profit margin for the third quarter was 41.6%, a decrease of 90 basis points compared with the adjusted gross profit margin reported in the year ago period. Adjusted gross profit increased $14.1 million over the year ago period, driven primarily by higher sales volume and productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable pricing for certain products and to a lesser degree changes in channel mix, as well as higher input costs for certain commodity related items, particularly steel and certain oil based components. These same factors contributed to the decline in adjusted gross profit margin as well.","Next, adjusted SDA expenses were up $26.6 million compared with the year ago period. Adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales was 27.2% in the third quarter, an increase of 130 basis points from the year ago period. The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales and greater employee related costs, including higher compensation expense, rising healthcare and an increase of the number of associates primarily due to acquisitions, compared with the year ago period. We also experienced an increase in outside professional, product testing and certification fees associated with actions taken to address industry shortages for certain electronic components.","Excluding the impact of higher freight and commission expense due to the increase in sales volume, greater employee related costs accounted for a little more than half of the remaining increase in total SDA expense this quarter compared with the year ago period. We expect this higher level of employee related cost to continue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018 as labor markets remain tight contributing to a rise in wage inflation. An interesting point to note, our adjusted variable contribution margin on a sequential basis this quarter compared to the second quarter was up almost 29%. Our adjusted diluted EPS was $2.37 compared with $2.15 reported in the year ago period. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impact on income for the tax law and the lower average shares outstanding due to stock repurchases in the past year, partially offset by a decline in operating profit this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to highlight a few important accomplishments this quarter. On the strategic and technology front, we continued to make positive strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong profitable growth over the long term. While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise, we believe sales in our Tier 3 and 4 categories encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up over 40% this quarter and represent more than 15% of our total net sales so far this year. As a reminder, Tier 3 includes the sale of our network and IoT-enabled luminaires, while Tier 4 includes recurring revenues for services, primarily from our Atrius IoT solution set. The growth in our combined Tier 3 and 4 was driven primarily by greater shipments of Atrius-based luminaires in key verticals, as demand for these lighting based IoT solutions continued to expand.","From a commercial perspective, we have accelerated the number of Atrius-enabled deployments and increased active programs with several of the largest U.S. based retailers as well as other key vertical applications including certain types of public buildings. We believe these commitments and orders from customers accelerating the expansion of their current platforms as well as customers moving beyond pilot programs to implementation will afford us the opportunity to meaningfully expand our installed base of Atrius enabled systems in future quarters.","Also, we just introduced the next generation of our industry-leading lighting control system nLight AIR. We believe Acuity has the most comprehensive and feature-rich wired and wireless lighting control systems available.","Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of IOTA, the industry leader in emergency lighting and power equipment for commercial and institutional applications. This acquisition will further enhance our market leadership in this important lighting category.","Lastly, we initiated a number of actions this past quarter to further streamline our operations to reduce costs and improve our productivity. These initiatives will enhance our operating and financial performance as well as allow us to accelerate investments in areas with higher growth opportunities. These actions were taken considering prevailing market conditions and our focus on driving initiatives consistent with our long-term growth strategies. Ricky will have additional comments on this in a moment.","We have been able to create these capabilities while providing industry-leading results because of the dedication and resolve of our associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction markets later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of calendar 2018. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you Vern and good morning everyone. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the third quarter of fiscal 2018 and 2017, which we find useful to add-back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for the third quarter of both fiscal year 2018 and 2017. Adjusted results exclude the impact of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, acquisition related items, special charges for streamlining activities and excess inventory adjustments related to facility closures.","We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. In addition, many of our peer companies, especially as we become more of a technology company, make similar adjustments, so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.","During the third quarter of fiscal 2018, we recognized a pretax special charge of $9.9 million, primarily related to the planned consolidation of certain facilities and associated reduction in employee workforce. The special charge consists primarily of severance and employee related benefit costs. We also recorded a $3.1 million charge during the third quarter to reserve for raw material inventory located at one of the facilities where production activities will cease because it will not be cost effective to relocate that inventory. We expect to incur additional costs in future periods associated with the closing of the facilities, primarily attributed to early lease terminations and moving cost. We expect the annual savings from these streamlining actions, once fully implemented, to exceed the amount of the special charge. The savings will be reinvested in activities to support higher growth opportunities as well as drive improved profitability.","The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 26.4% compared with 34% in the prior-year quarter. The lower tax rate was primarily due to the U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act signed into law last December. We currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate, before discrete items, will approximate 26% to 28% for the remainder of fiscal 2018 and 23% to 25% for fiscal 2019. As these lower rates reflect, the passage of the new U.S. tax law will have a meaningful positive impact on lowering taxes paid by Acuity, thus benefiting our future earnings and cash flow. The impact of tax legislation may differ from current estimates, possibly materially due to among other things, changes in interpretations or assumptions the company has made, guidance that may be issued and actions the company may make as a result of the tax legislation.","On May 1, 2018, using cash on hand and borrowings available under our line of credit, we acquired IOTA Engineering, headquartered in Tucson, Arizona. IOTA manufactures highly engineered emergency lighting products and power equipment for commercial and institutional applications, both in the U.S. and internationally. IOTA's operating results and preliminary amounts related to the acquisition accounting were included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of the acquisition and are not material.","We generated $300.7 million of net cash flow provided by operating activities during the nine months ended May 31, 2018 compared with $198 million for the year ago period, an increase of $102.7 million. This significant increase in cash flow compared with the year ago period was due primarily to lower operating working capital requirements, lower variable incentive compensation payments and lower payments for income taxes. Operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, decreased approximately $3 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2018. The increase in inventory during the nine months ended May 31, 2018 was primarily due to customer expansion in the home center showroom channel, new product launches and build up of finished goods to support committed projects in the corporate accounts channel. The increase in inventory was mostly offset by a corresponding increase in accounts payable during the same period.","At May 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalent balance of $94.3 million, a decrease of $216.8 million since August 31, 2017. The decrease was due primarily to cash used to repurchase common stock, to fund acquisitions, to invest in plant and equipment and to pay dividends, partially offset by strong cash flow from operations. We repurchased 800,000 shares for $104.1 million during the third quarter of fiscal 2018. Fiscal year-to-date we have repurchased two million shares for $298.4 million. We have 5.2 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase Board authorization. Our investment in capital expenditures was $32.2 million for the nine months of fiscal 2018, a decrease of $23 million compared with the prior year. We currently expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018.","On June 29, 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a $400 million, five-year unsecured revolving credit facility and a $400 million unsecured delayed draw five-year term loan facility. Our total debt outstanding was $358 million at May 31, 2018. Our debt to capitalization at May 31, 2018 was 18.3% and net debt to capital was 14.1%. We had additional borrowing capacity of $704.3 million at July 2, 2018 under our new credit and term loan facilities, which do not expire until June 2023. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility to accommodate the current stock repurchase program of which 5.2 million shares remain available for repurchase and will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you and I will turn it back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you Ricky. Current market conditions in the lighting industry continues to create a challenging environment for management to drive short term financial performance while continuing to invest in attractive long term opportunities. Nonetheless, we are optimistic regarding our long-term future. Our many actions taken this quarter to reduce costs and improve our capabilities were done so we can continue to optimize our financial performance, while continuing to invest in areas we believe have high growth potential over the long-term.","We are often asked about the vitality and conditions of the key end markets we serve. On one hand, market data suggests that the overall growth rate of the U.S. lighting market improved slightly this quarter compared with the previous three quarters, which were down low single digits compared with the year ago periods. Many reasons have been cited for this softness including among others, weak nonresidential construction activity, lack of skilled labor, current uncertainty regarding trade policies, substitutions to lower priced alternative products and pricing pressures in some end markets for certain less featured products.","On the other hand, while we believe all of this is true to varying degrees, we continue to pull our vast customer base and channel partners and from the majority we continue to hear guarded optimism regarding the prospects for future growth. Generally speaking, the trades continue to be busy and backlogs are favorable.","As for our market expectations for the balance of calendar year 2018, we continue to see favorable trends in certain leading indicators, hear from customers that large projects are set to release and see some encouraging reports from third-party forecasting organizations. Nonetheless, we remain cautious due to increasing inflationary pressures including the impact of recent tariff actions. However and most important, we expect to continue to outperform the overall growth rate of the markets we serve, primarily in North America.","Further, we believe the sales of our Atrius-based luminaires within our Tier 3 and 4 categories will continue to expand, though and I would like to emphasize, this will be lumpy at times because of the unpredictability and timing of customer's renovation and new construction cycles. Next, we believe that product substitutions to lower priced alternatives for certain products in portions of the lighting market will continue, particularly for more basic, lesser featured products sold through certain channels, pressuring topline growth and profitability. The relaunch of our Contractor Select portfolio and other actions taken were done to enhance our opportunities for profitable growth in this portion of the market.","Further, we believe the price of certain LED components will continue to decline though at a decelerating pace, while certain other costs including certain components and commodity costs, especially steel prices, which are being influenced by the recently enacted tariffs as well as certain employee costs primarily due to compensation inflation caused by tight labor market and other related costs, we will continue to see increase.","Our adjusted SDA costs as a percentage of net sales this quarter was 27.2%. We believe this percentage is still a bit high but is reflective of the necessary investment that are driving growth in our Tier 3 and 4 platforms. We expect to mitigate the impact of some of these rising costs in certain pricing initiatives, which we announced this quarter, ongoing productivity improvements and the implementation of programs to reduce product and other overhead costs, including our announced streamlining actions though the timing of these initiatives might lag the timing of these increased costs.","Additionally, our gross profit margin is influenced by several factors including sales volume, innovation, components and commodity costs, market level pricing and changes in product and sales channel mix. Through our continuous improvement efforts, we are always striving to improve our profitability. However, we believe that for any meaningful margin improvement to occur, we will need to experience an acceleration in market demand, particularly for larger commercial projects. Also, we expect our gross margins to improve once the introduction of our newest products and solutions become a more meaningful portion of our revenues over the next several quarters and as our mix evolves as we execute our tiered solution strategy, particularly for our Atrius-based solutions as well as our nLight control system and lastly, as we realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","Next, we continue to be leery of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are unpredictable. So to be very clear, our focus is to garner additional topline growth driven primarily by our ability to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve, continue to improve the mix of products and solutions sold as we execute our tiered solution strategy and to leverage our fixed cost infrastructure to achieve targeted incremental margins to improve our overall profitability.","Lastly, we are focused on and very excited by the long-term potential of the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting, building management and Atrius IoT platform and software solutions. The world of data optimization targeted by our Atrius platform, is in the early stages of development and we believe Acuity is uniquely positioned to take full advantage of these high growth opportunities.","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy and opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is an integral part of our overall strategy. This all takes focus and resources. We are investing today to enhance and expand our core competencies, affording us the opportunity to excel over the long-term in our fast changing industry because we see great future opportunity.","As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building management systems market have the potential to experience significant growth over the next decade because of the continued opportunities for new construction and more importantly the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size to more efficient and effective solutions. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation along with our Atrius platform, we are positioned well to fully participate in and lead these exciting and growing industries. Therefore we remain bullish regarding the company's long-term prospects for continued profitable growth particularly as we bring more value-added solutions to the market to both new construction and the conversion of the installed base.","Thank you. With that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs. You may go ahead.","Brian Lee","Hi guys. Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe just to start off, big result in the Tier 3, Tier 4 sales. So kudos to you guys on that. The 40% growth that you mentioned, Vern, that was the best result we have seen in over a year in that particular category. Also, a pretty big acceleration off the past few quarters. Was this is mostly driven by the strength in large infrastructure and utility projects you mentioned in the prepared remarks? Just trying to get a sense for, as you alluded to how lumpy this quarter's result was for that group of products and then what you are thinking about the growth for Tier 3, Tier 4 sort of in the back half of the calendar year, if it moderates at all?","Vern Nagel","So Tier 3 and Tier 4 solutions really are part of our both Atrius-based luminaires as well as our interconnected energy management\/lighting solutions. The growth that we continue to experience is really as more and more customers recognize the future potential benefit of what these solutions and capabilities can mean to their business really by transforming how they view their property and their assets, building assets, really as an expense, making them more as a powerful opportunity to be a strategic asset, we are taking advantage of not only the quality of light upgrades, the energy savings, but what the future potential of this is. So we see expansion in retail, we see expansion in other public spaces for these types of luminaires. The growth this quarter, as we continue to say, everyone, all of you analysts are looking at it on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We tend to look at these things more on an annual basis because the construction cycle for various customers varies greatly. And so, yes, this quarter was terrific but if I look at the full year, we are experiencing full growth or great growth in these categories and we expect that that overall growth rate continue as we look at more annual increments not necessarily quarter-by-quarter. Yes, this was strong quarter and the backlog continues to be favorable for Acuity.","Brian Lee","Okay. Fair enough. And maybe just quickly on that point, do you expect the large infrastructure and utility projects shrink that you saw this quarter to persist here in the near-term or were those fairly concentrated in the quarter given the timing of the projects? And then just quickly on the balance sheet, I am wondering if you could, Ricky, give us some color on two moving pieces, the big inventory build, what the composition was there, what drove the increase and how that should trend going forward? And then any commentary you have on the payables moving up as well? Thank you guys.","Vern Nagel","So Ricky, let me take the infrastructure question. We are very pleased and excited by sales forces bringing solutions to the infrastructure and utility community. We have great products. We have great solutions. And we have great sales forces that are differentiating those capabilities to our customers. So we continue to see that as a positive growth area. And we would expect that to continue as we go forward.","Ricky Reece","Yes. And Brian, on the balance sheet, on the inventory increase, it's primarily in the finished goods area as we increased inventories, as we expand our customer base and home center and showroom channel. So we are building up inventory as we load into some of these new customer bases. Some of the growth that we are seeing in this Tier 3, Tier 4 opportunities were some big corporate accounts. This necessitated us to bring in some finished goods as they are managing their construction cycle and when we would anticipate going in and doing the installation and commissioning of those products. And then the Contractor Select new product line or revitalization of that existing product line is taking off at some 200-plus new product families in that category and as we are ramping up to and launching those products out into various channels has caused the finished goods to come up.","The payable increase is directly related to that. Much of this increase happened later in the quarter and therefore the payables have not yet matured and paid off. We would expect to see the inventory to gradually come back down as we launch these and will then just get in refurbishment, refilling type of endeavor. But the primary was in the finished goods area for the reasons I described.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Good morning. Nice volumes. As the price mix has gotten more negative, you know the volumes have certainly picked up here. Are you seeing a real demand response to your kind of pricing at the low end and kind of seeking out a final remedy for the emergence of the offshores over the past year or two?","Vern Nagel","So Chris, as we think about that portion of the market that favors more, let's say, less featured, more price competitive solution sets and you are right, it's being driven we think by, well still legal activity in terms of dumping a product on to the market, which various industry consortiums are looking to address. That, notwithstanding, we are introducing, relaunching as Ricky points out, Contractor Select and this portfolio of products and services and the way we are attacking the market in a little bit of a different way, is directed right at the opportunity of serving this market. And we are in the early stages of introducing our Contractor Select capabilities but we are already starting to see the benefits of that.","We believe in the last quarter, we picked up a couple points of share in that portion of the market. We see our unit volumes continuing to pick up but we are also seeing, from a pricing perspective, attacking that with better margin products doing that. I would expect the price in that portion of the market to continue to be challenging but I think that we are in good stead to make that happen. I know that there is a lot of questions regarding the overall marketplace for larger projects and is pricing in some of this moving into that world?","You know, I find it fascinating looking at various data points. If we look and we use the U.S. census data a lot, if we look at private nonresidential construction over the last year and even a little bit longer than that, the market's been flat to down. This is construction spend. This is nothing, lighting is only a small portion of that. So we are fighting, if you will, this trend in the marketplace, which by the way, to me, we are starting to see some positiveness. The last quarter, we saw an uptick from the U.S. census data on private nonresidential construction. So for us, it's really more about a volume gain. We don't believe that pricing, if you will, has meaningfully moved into that market or people who are dumping products have moved in that portion of the market.","We see on our large jobs just know that's what's contributing to the flatness, if you will. They are slightly down in the C&I channel. We are seeing a resurgence, which we hope is a harbinger of positive things in that lower, less featured area of the market, where we think we have a real competitive advantage based on our ability of the size of portfolio, our ability to serve customers. We are trying to get our supply chains kind of linked up a little bit to the increase in volume. So we are having a little bit of noise around that. But I would tell you that we are favorable to where we have positioned the business to compete in that world going forward.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And it sounds like Contractor Select is more a go forward driver. So were some your volume successes in the quarter at the low end involving taking an upfront margin hit and flushing some of the product that wasn't cost sized to serve that market?","Vern Nagel","I wouldn't say that necessarily. No. We are moving product into the marketplace and introducing solution sets. Contractor Select is a relaunch. As Ricky points out, there is a number of new products that we also have products in that space that are very cost-effective. I think it's really we are altering our service model a little bi. We are altering how we support our customers. And truthfully, our key customers are far more interested in having the preference of Juno or Lithonia based luminaire because Acuity stands behind in.","When we give warrantees on these products, people know that they can count on us to deliver against them and they are not sure about some of these other entrants that are into the market that are selling, if you will, over the Internet. There is a lot of training. There is a whole lot capability that goes along with what Acuity brings to the marketplace that are at points of differentiation into the market, not just price. Obviously price is important, but it's not the only thing that occurs. So I would say, the answer to your question is no.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. And last one, would you care to opine on what's been a bigger mix mover over the past few quarters between defending share at the low end versus the ebb in the higher value mix of projects in the marketplace?","Vern Nagel","Yes. I would say that as we looked at our price mix this particular quarter, it was approximately five points price mix, kind of the biggest number that we have seen there. But when we look at, it's hard to precisely analyze that. We think a little bit more of it is price and products substitution, but a big chunk of that is the fact that we are growing our Atrius-based luminaires in certain key channels. Now those are fantastic products. But the standard margin of those things because often they are going into large projects that have lots of the same type of luminaire, the standard margin on those is just different than what we historically experience on large commercial projects that have massive amounts of different types of luminaires.","So as a percentage of our total revenues, these are just approximate numbers. The C&I channel has historically represented about 60% of our total sales. This quarter that number was probably more in the 56%, 57% of total sales. So there is a margin difference that we experience because again of the difference of products that we sell into that C&I channel mostly for larger projects. If I look at larger projects as we internally defined them, that was the primary reason for, if you will, the slight decline in overall C&I. So for us, that channel mix really played a big part and until we start to see, if you will, that larger project coming back and again I look at the census data, the last quarter or so has started to turn positive on construction put in place.","That's all construction and not private nonresidential construction. And that usually is a leading indicator, six months down the road of positiveness on larger projects for Acuity. And we do well there because they are complicated, they require lots of support and we are really good at it. I am also very excited about the introduction or the expansion of our nLight capabilities. The wireless solution that was introduced is massively comprehensive and will be a huge, I believe, opportunity for us to grow that larger project business. But also primarily in the renovation side, we are starting to see a great deal of interest on larger renovation projects that are coupled with our nLight wireless capabilities. So we are optimistic about what that holds for us going forward.","Christopher Glynn","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities. You may go ahead.","Joseph Osha","Thank you and hello. I have got two for you. First I am wondering if we could dive a little more into how much of an impact materials cost have had in the quarter?","Vern Nagel","Ricky, do you want to get that?","Ricky Reece","Yes. We certainly have seen a bit of headwind in material costs largely around the commodity metals, steel, aluminum, both of which more from a secondary impact of the tariffs. We don't purchase that much steel that are directly impacted by the tariffs but we have seen steel cost go up regardless the U.S. manufactured steel. So we are seeing a bit of a pressure there. There is some electronic components that we are seeing a little bit of pressure on based on shortages that currently exist in those areas and would expect in the future to continue to see a bit of pressure based on the tariffs that the administration has announced, the 301 tariffs that will be on some of the China areas. We are looking at ways to mitigate that, both in cost reductions, price increases as well as sourcing from areas that aren't as impacted by the tariffs, but it has had an impact. We haven't exactly quantified it in the public announcements, but I would say it's not a material number, but it is putting some pressure on our margins.","Joseph Osha","Okay. Thanks Ricky. And then the second one for me would be, can we get some color in terms of what the uptake on this price hike that you announced back at LIGHTFAIR has been? How much of that would you say has stuck so far?","Vern Nagel","So Ricky, I mean just commenting on the impact to materials, completely agree, secondary impact rolling through. We announced our price increase on certain products certain, if you will, traditional fluorescent-based products but also certain LED products. Those price hikes on average were in the 6%-plus range. They were due to take effect, I think, June 11, I think was the date, some of that nature. So those are starting to roll through. We are seeing the benefits of some of that. Our expectation, because everyone coming into this space on these types of products is experiencing cost inflation. So I have some optimism that those price increases will stick into the marketplace. But it's absolutely too early to impact our results for Q3 and our expectations is that it will help offset some of these costs as we get into Q4 and beyond.","Joseph Osha","Okay. So just to be clear and then I will get off the phone here. So you would expect some of these price increases to start rolling through your numbers for the August quarter?","Vern Nagel","Yes.","Joseph Osha","All right. Thanks a lot.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. You may go ahead.","Tim Wojs","Hi guys. Good morning.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Tim Wojs","I just wanted to, on the home centers, could you just give us a little bit of an update of where you are in those two transitions from one customer to another? And just how that ties into the inventory? And will a lot of that product wind up shipping in the fourth quarter?","Vern Nagel","So to be extremely clear, we are not transitioning from one customer to another. We are expanding our access to a number of markets including the home center channel. And that's really important to draw the distinction to your question. The product portfolio of Contractor Select also supports not only the home center channel but it also supports the electrical distribution channel. So as we introduce the Contractor Select portfolio, as Ricky pointed out in answering the question on inventory, our expectation is that it will support growth in the home center channel as well as the C&I channel. Home center, for us, this quarter were up slightly after being down the previous two quarters. We still have tremendous opportunity in front of us to support our key partners in that channel as well as ED. So those folks will be seeing also new product introductions coming into their world and I would expect that, for us, in the home center channel it will be, like all of channels, an opportunity for growth.","Tim Wojs","Great. Okay. Yes, I know transition was probably a bad word. Sorry about that. Thanks for clarifying. And then second, just on the buybacks. You bought back some in Q2 and some in Q3 and now you have the expanded debt financing. Should we think that there is just a gradual buyback cadence that you guys will have? Or does the debt refinancing accelerate some of the stock buyback?","Vern Nagel","So Tim and to everyone out there, if you look at our organization over the last decade plus, we have done a really focused job of about a third of our cash flows repurchasing shares, about a third of our cash flows doing acquisitions, about a third of our cash flows doing both dividends as well as capital expenditures. If you look at the last quarter, we spent $160 million plus doing two really very interesting acquisitions for us. One expands some of our analytics in what we call our technology group really allowing us to do more Tier 4 capabilities. And then the other acquisition was really to solidify our position in emergency and power backup capabilities within the lighting industry. So we have solidified our leadership. Those are two good examples of how we are deploying capital to bring value to shareholders.","In addition to that in the quarter, we spent near $300 million, I think Dan it was $298 million?","Dan Smith","For the year-to-date.","Vern Nagel","Year-to-date, sorry. Excuse me on that. $298 million buying a couple million shares. But I believe that over the last five quarters, we have spent a little over $600 million purchasing 10% of our shares outstanding. So what we are doing is, we are looking at all of these alternatives on a longer-term basis. So Ricky and Dan expanded our credit facility to give us more flexibility because we do have authorization from the Board where we still have 5.2 million shares that we could purchase. So you are absolutely right. We are going to look at all of this as we have done over the last decade plus in a very strategic fashion. The M&A pipeline, Ricky and team continue to be busy seeing alternatives. So we are always looking for ways to deploy our financial strength in our balance sheet in ways that drive shareholder value.","Tim Wojs","Great. Well, good luck on the fourth quarter and then the next year.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Rick Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. You may go ahead.","Rick Kwas","Hi. Good morning. Just a couple of questions with regards to volume. Vern, was very significant benefit from volume with regards to getting out of the price increase? And then how would you characterize the benefit from Contractor Select at this point in terms of the current quarter on volume? How should we think about that in terms of the benefit on volume?","Vern Nagel","So I think that in the stock and flow smaller project world, our volumes were up. And so volumes were up. Some of that also has price and product substitutions as part of that. So net net, we were still positive in that portion of the market. When we look at what's happening with our Atrius-based luminaires to what we call our enterprise solutions group, those were favorable. Infrastructure and utility contributed. Again, as I said, most channels and geographies were favorable this quarter in terms of net sales dollars increase. So the unit volume and the sales volume was favorable in not just one area versus another. And then that would have been somewhat offset by the fact that larger projects were not there. We saw, again, a decline in that area.","So I think we had a fantastic quarter from a value perspective. And if we had just been normal, if the market had been normal, sorry, on just larger projects, which again I am optimistic that those things will start to turn, we would have seen not only additional volume, less of an impact on price, less of an impact on mix and better margins. I was very pleased, by the way, Rick, to see our variable contribution margin on incremental sales sequentially from third quarter from second quarter. I think that's indicative of the current market conditions and our ability to, from the actions that we are taking to get variable contribution on those sales growth dollars.","Rick Kwas","Okay. So the Contractor Select as well as the price increase probably helped volume, but it sounds like that that benefit should, Contractor Select should benefit volume on a go forward basis. I mean it's not going to be --","Vern Nagel","Rich, I would say that it's more of a go forward type thing than a big impact on Q3. As Ricky points out, the big impact on Q3 from Contractor Select was just building up our inventories in anticipation of load-ins both in the home center channel as well as the electrical distribution channel which is meaningfully larger than jus the home center channel.","Rick Kwas","Okay. And then the price increase really is not affecting much on LED, correct? It's only small pieces of the LED portfolio?","Vern Nagel","Well, so imagine, again, what Contractor Select is meant to do, it's meant to have attractive price points but also have a better margin profile for us. So we are moving the cheese a little bit, right. Price increases are on existing products, we are actually introducing new products that have better margin profile. But on existing products, where we have increased prices that has been primarily for those luminaires that have high steel content and that is more primarily driven off of fluorescent base luminaries.","The other thing that I would submit to you on price increases is the fact that 75% of our, if you will, lighting business is project-based. So it's always been a competitive business, not necessarily that we say here is a single widget at a price and oh by the way, we decreased the price some percentage. So I would say that the price impact or the impact of price increases is, it will have some impact but it will only be in that portion of our business that is subject to more stock and flow. And you will see more of that.","Rick Kwas","So that's 25% or so of the sales? Okay. All right. That's helpful. And then just one clarification. I think it was on Chris Glynn's question on the C&I, so you said usually it's about 60% of the business. This quarter it was 56% to 57%. Then you are differentiating Atrius on standard margin versus large projects, large commercial projects. Can you just run through that again? It wasn't clear to me what you were trying to get across with regards to the Atrius and then large C&I projects on the margin?","Vern Nagel","Well, okay. So if I look at our total business typically or historically, I should say, C&I has represented 60% of our total sales roughly and it fluctuates. This quarter, it was down probably for three to four points. So other portions or other channels, sales through other channels had a higher percentage. A higher percentage sale of portion was through what we call our enterprise solutions, which is primarily the sale of Atrius-based luminaries. And so those luminaires, because of where they are going, they are a lot of the same type of luminaires.","So the standard margin at the gross profit level of those is typically less than what we would experience in larger projects, where we sell a much broader range of luminaires and those jobs in the large construction markets through C&I are usually very, very complicated. And so the ability to service them, to commission them, to do all of the things that are necessary, there is a higher, we typically extract a higher standard margin. But there is also higher cost to serve, which is a bit different than what we would experience maybe selling through large retailers for use in their facilities or at airports where you sell thousands of this exact same luminaire type and the cost to serve on those is typically not as significant as the cost to serve on large commercial projects.","Rick Kwas","Okay. That's helpful. Just a real quick clarification on that. I thought Atrius had more software content. So wouldn't that help the margin a bit versus your traditional large C&I projects?","Vern Nagel","So it would help the margin relative to large on our fluorescent type products in that particular channel. So the answer is, you have to look at it by channel and the opportunity to get higher margins because of it being Atrius-enabled and the higher margin is really the use of data off of that solution set, but it's compared it into that channel. We don't really compare one channel to another for what the margin profile is primarily because they are just so different. When you are selling thousand of the same fixture into a single location, it's very different than what you are selling 20 and 30 different luminaires into a similar size space. They are just different profile.","Rick Kwas","Right. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. Have a great fourth.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. You may go ahead.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning everyone. A couple for me. First, just on the Contractor Select. We have heard from some of your competitors that they plan to or are thinking about maybe pulling back a little bit from the low end to kind of address the margin pressures in the industry. I wonder if you are seeing that at all what the competitive response has been the what you are doing with Contractor Select, if anything is visible at this point?","Vern Nagel","No. We are not seeing our competitors, including our traditional competitors backing off, no.","Jeffrey Sprague","And then on the inventory build in the quarter, would there have been an absorption benefit in your margins? And if so, how significant would that have been?","Vern Nagel","I would say there was a bit of it. Clearly we capitalized the conversion cost and so forth, as you would expect, but we had higher conversion costs because we had a lot more freight bringing the products in and then we source a lot more production, production exceeded sales and so forth. But the whole purpose of capitalizing that is to match it to then when the sale is but we did capitalize a lot more on the freight and the conversion cost. But then again, we expensed or incurred a lot more because we are bringing a lot more product in and producing a lot more as well. So it's designed to get the better matching so it should keep the margins consistent quarter-to-quarter, everything else equal.","Jeffrey Sprague","Understood. And then just one last one. On the capacity moves, obviously understandable you need to take cost actions in this environment, but you are taking capacity out at a time that you are growing volume. I just wonder if you could give us a little bit of sense of the magnitude of the capacity reduction and if you are doing something different on sourcing or automation or some other element of your supply chain to kind of accomplish and to the balance that juggling act there.","Vern Nagel","Yes. So without providing absolute specifics, the ability to absorb one facility's, it was a smaller facility, it's productive capabilities, we had excess capacity or the capacity, if you will to absorb those into other locations driving efficiencies, driving connectivity around those products into the locations where they end up. So it's part of our lean process. We adopted lean manufacturing principles probably 15 years ago and our supply chain continues to really do an excellent job of driving productivity. So we took advantage of the opportunity to consolidate some of these things to help us improve our cost profile and our productivity to be competitive, more competitive and drive better financial results in the current environment that we find ourselves in.","Ricky Reece","And I would add, Jeff, that several of these facilities are not large manufacturing, as Vern said. It came about as part of these acquisitions that we did. So it's an opportunity for us to consolidate some of the recent acquisitions, facilities that we acquired to get greater efficiency than having a bunch of tiny facilities that came with some of the acquisitions.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. I appreciate the color.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you everyone for your time this morning. Again, we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that have the potential over the longer-term to deliver strong returns for our key stakeholders. Again, get our future is bright and thank you for your support.","Operator","That concludes today's conference. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."],"650":["Acuity Brands, Inc.

After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer, and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you and good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2019 third quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We are webcasting today's conference call on our website at acuitybrands.com. I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties, such that actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now, let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. Our results for the third quarter were very solid despite continuing inflationary cost pressures, the impact of tariffs and further uncertainties caused by U.S trade policies. We implemented several programs to address these cost issues including additional price increases, product and freight cost reductions and further actions to improve productivity.","We believe our top line growth this past quarter was negatively impacted by the pull forward of orders from customers into the first half of the year as they acted to avoid announced price increases as well as reduced shipments in the retail channel due to efforts initiated this year to eliminate products within our portfolio that do not meet our profitability hurdles, primarily in the retail channel.","I will provide greater detail on our sales mix later in the call. Additionally, we\u2019re pleased that our adjusted gross profit margin exceeded 40% for the first time in a year and improved sequentially for the third quarter in a row. Our adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.53 was a third quarter record.","I know many of you\u2019ve already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the third quarter of 2019. Net sales were $948 million, a slight increase over the year-ago period. Reported operating profit was $120.3 million compared with $107.4 million in the year ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $2.22 compared with a $1.80 in the year-ago period.","There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain other add backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods as Ricky will explain later in the call. In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2019 was $135.5 million or 14.3% of the net sales compared with adjusted operating profit of $137.3 million in the year ago period of 14.5% of net sales.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.53, a third quarter record, up 7% from the year ago period. Results this period were benefited by lower effective tax rate as Ricky will explain later in the call. Net cash provided by operating activities was a strong $312 million for the first nine months of the year, up nicely over the year ago period and our cash position at the end of the quarter grew to $334 million leaving us with plenty of liquidity to execute our growth strategies.","Looking at some specific details for the quarter. Net sales were essentially flat when compared with the year ago period. Overall, net sales volume grew more than 1%, which was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange rates and the adoption of ACS 606. Changes in product, prices and the mix of products sold were essentially flat compared with the prior year as higher pricing was offset by changes in the mix of products sold and customer mix within certain channels.","We estimate the realization from recent price increases contributed low single-digit growth to overall net sales for the quarter. From a channel perspective, the increase in net sales in our independent sales network was largely offset by lower net sales in the retail channel compared with the year ago period. The decline in net sales in the retail channel was primarily due to the impact of efforts initiated this year to eliminate certain product categories that do not meet our expected profit margin profile.","We believe our growth in net sales this quarter was also muted by the impact of customers, primarily in the independent sales network channel pulling forward orders into the first half of the year in advance of announced price increases. We -- while we noted this activity in our previous two earnings calls, we were unable to determine the precise impact of the sales shift between quarters.","Looking more closely at the details of our net sales this quarter, net sales through our independent sales network were up almost 3%. Our growth in this channel was benefited by implemented price increases, market share gains in certain lighting categories, particularly for lighting controls and growth of our building management solutions platform at Distech, which again performed exceptionally well this quarter.","We believe the growth rate of our C&I business within the independent sales network channel was more than double the overall rate of growth for this particular market. Our growth in C&I was primarily due to greater shipments of certain high volume more basic lesser featured LED fixtures, primarily for applications on smaller and midsized commercial projects, significant growth of our lighting controls platform, nLight and the benefit from our implemented price increases, all partially offset by prolonged delays for larger nonresidential lighting projects as well as continued product substitution to lower-priced alternatives for certain lighting products.","Additionally, net sales in our corporate accounts and direct sales channels were down slightly compared with the year-ago period, primarily due to the completion of certain large projects in the year ago period, and to a lesser degree slower releases for certain renovation projects. Net sales in the retail channel declined approximate $12 million this quarter compared with the year ago period.","As I noted earlier, the decline was primarily due to the elimination this year of certain products sold primarily through the retail channel as part of a comprehensive review of our product portfolio for those products that do not meet our margin profile expectations. While we expect these efforts to result in lower net sales in this channel over the next few quarters, we ultimately expect that these actions will be margin accretive as operating profit dollars are expected to remain fairly constant.","With regard to the impact of net sales for changes in the price and mix of products sold, the overall net impact was essentially flat this quarter. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in the price and mix of products sold, we estimate the impact of price increases contributed low single digits to our overall growth in the quarter. This positive price capture was offset by changes in channel and product mix.","The change in channel and product mix this quarter was mostly influenced by changes in sales to certain customers within certain channels and to a much lesser degree the extent product substitution to lower-priced alternatives, primarily for more basic lesser featured LED luminaires sold in certain channels as well as a modest decline in shipments for larger commercial projects.","Our profitability measures for the third quarter were solid given these overall market conditions. Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $136 million, down ever so slightly compared with the year ago period, while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 14.3%, down 20 basis points from the year ago period. If one were to reconcile our adjusted operating profit and margin in both periods for the U.S GAAP mandated accounting changes for ACS 606 and the pension accounting pronouncement in 2018, our adjusted operating profit this quarter would have exceeded the year ago period by approximately $1.3 million and adjusted operating profit margin would have been the same compared with the year ago period.","Our adjusted gross profit margin for the third quarter was 40.5%, a decrease of about 110 basis points compared with the year ago period. Adjusted gross profit was $384 million, down $9 million from the year ago period. The decline in gross margin was primarily due to a shift in net sales among key customers within the retail channel and the significant impact from the under absorption of manufacturing operating costs as a consequence of our inventory reduction efforts this year compared with an increase in inventory in the year ago period.","The inventory build in the year ago period was necessary to service certain very large orders that were required to be shipped in the fourth quarter in both corporate accounts and retail channels. As we mentioned last quarter, our adjusted gross profit and margin were negatively impacted by a shift in net sales between key customers within our retail channel. Each of our key customers in this channel have different service requirements, which impact how we account for these differences under generally accepted accounting principles.","We believe the impact of this customer shift within this channel accounted for approximately a third of the decline in overall adjusted gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales in the third quarter compared with the year-ago. However, it is important to note, we believe much of this decline was largely offset with lower SDA expense.","Next our adjusted SDA expenses were down approximately $7 million compared with the year ago period. Adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales was 26.2% in the third quarter, a decrease of 90 basis points from the year ago period. Again, the decline in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to lower freight costs caused primarily by the customer shift within the retail channel.","Our adjusted diluted EPS was a third quarter record of $2.53 compared with $2.37 reported in the year ago period, an increase of 7%. The increase was primarily due to higher adjusted net income, which was benefited primarily by a lower effective tax rate this quarter as well as lower average shares outstanding.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this past quarter. On the strategic and technology front, we continue to make significant strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be solid growth in revenue and profitability over the long-term. We continue to gain market share in many important product categories and sales channels. Our Tier 3 and 4 solutions continue to expand and now make up more than 20% of our net sales. Our new product introductions continue to be well received by the market, some winning various awards for innovation.","From a commercial perspective, we continue to accelerate the number of Atrius-enabled deployments and increased active programs with several of the largest U.S.-based retailers. Our Atrius-based IoT luminaires and solutions are becoming the industry standard in the big-box retail segment. We believe that over 20% of the floor space of big box retailers is in the U.S is now Atrius-enabled.","Additionally, we continue to expand these differentiated solutions into other verticals as awareness by customers grows as they come to recognize the full benefits of these solutions, including superior visual comfort and energy savings as well as the capabilities of our IoT solutions providing them with the opportunity to transform their spaces from nothing more than expense items into strategic assets.","As I mentioned in prior earnings calls, it is clear that certain Chinese-based lighting companies, many obviously being subsidized in some form are influencing pricing for certain basic lesser featured fixtures sold in certain channels. We will not yield this space for many strategic reasons. As such, we have continued to expand our Contractor Select portfolio and further enhance our service platforms to profitably compete in this portion of the market.","We believe our lighting and BMS controls capabilities continue to expand at more than double the overall estimated market growth rate for these solutions. We believe Acuity has the most comprehensive and feature-rich wired and wireless lighting control systems available in the nonresidential market and importantly they are connected to our growing BMS solutions providing customers with even more functionality.","Lastly, this year we initiated comprehensive reviews in two key areas of our company, compensation and environmental social and governance, or ESG. These reviews, which included feedback and insights from our shareholder base resulted in modification and enhancements to both programs. Specifically with regard to ESG, we believe these factors are important to the long-term success of Acuity brands and our stakeholders.","We are very pleased to announce that we've updated our EarthLIGHT website which highlight some of the significant efforts and results we have achieved today that lessen our impact on the earth and benefit our business associates, customers and communities. I encourage all of you to visit our website at www.acuitybrands.com\/about-us\/sustainability to view these impressive results.","We\u2019ve been able to create these capabilities while providing industry-leading results because of the dedication and resolve of our 12,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our key stakeholders. I will talk more about our expectations for the balance of 2019 later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the third quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for the third quarter and first nine months of fiscal year 2019 and 2018.","Adjusted results exclude the impact of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense, manufacturing inefficiencies directly related to the closure of a facility, excess inventory adjustments, acquisition related items, special charges for streamlining activities and an income tax net benefit for discrete items associated with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.","We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you'll find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.","In the third quarter of the prior fiscal year, we recorded a pre-tax special charge of $9.9 million, primarily with actions to streamline the organization. We expect to continue to incur additional costs in future periods associated with these actions initiated last year. The additional costs will consist primarily of early lease termination and moving cost associated with the closing of certain facilities. During the third quarter of this fiscal year, we reversed $100,000, a previously recorded special charges due to updated estimates.","The effective tax rate for the third quarter of fiscal 2019 was 20.9% compared with 26.4% in the prior year quarter. The decline in the current fiscal tax rate reflects a lower federal statutory rate and certain research and development costs tax credits, including claims for prior periods recognized during the third quarter of fiscal 2019. We currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate before discrete items will approximate 22% to 24% for fiscal 2019 and 2020.","Shortly after the end of our third quarter, on June 20, 2019 using cash on hand, we acquired WhiteOptics, L.L.C., headquartered in New Castle, Delaware. WhiteOptics is a manufacturer of advanced optical components used to reflect diffuse and control light for LED lighting using commercial and institutional applications. WhiteOptics' product portfolio includes light guide plates, optical diffusers and innovative micro-structure lenses that provide a unique three-dimensional appearance.","WhiteOptics' transmissive products include optics that improve the quality of light to support a low glare LED solutions and superior luminaire efficiency and energy savings. The acquisition of WhiteOptics is not expected to materially impact the company's fiscal 2019 consolidated financial performance. We did not disclose the terms of the acquisition.","We generated $312 million of net cash flow provided by operating activities during the first nine months of fiscal 2019 compared with $300 million for the year ago period. Operating working capital defined as receivables, plus inventory, less payables decreased almost $21 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019. This decrease is largely due to greater cash collections as well as fewer inventory purchases year-over-year partially offset by the timing of payments for trade payables.","We reduced our inventory by $22 million during the past quarter as our focus on improving inventory turns is yielding positive results. At May 31, 2019, we had a cash position of $334 million, an increase of $205 million since August 31, 2018. The increase was due primarily to the class cash flow from operations, partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock to invest in plant and equipment and to pay dividends.","We repurchased 400,000 shares for $49 million during the first nine months of fiscal 2019. We have 4.8 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase board authorization. Our investment in capital expenditures was $40 million for the first nine months of fiscal 2019, an increase of almost $8 million compared with the prior year period. We currently expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2019.","Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2019 include tooling for new products, equipment, facility renovations, information technology, including enhancements and upgrades to our industry-leading lighting and lighting control design software visual and our proprietary customer order portal agile, as well as normal ongoing property and equipment maintenance.","Last year we executed a new 5-year unsecured credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provide us with a total of $800 million of borrowing capacity, of which $795 million was available at May 31, 2019. Our total debt outstanding was $357 million at May 31, 2019. Our debt to capitalization at May 31, 2019 was 15.9% and net debt to net capital was 1.2%. Our $350 million senior unsecured notes mature in December 2019. We intend to refinance these borrowings using availability under our $400 million unsecured delayed draw 5-year term loan facility.","We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility to support our growth opportunities, which may include acquisitions and we will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you and I'll turn it back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. While current market conditions in the lighting industry continued to be challenging, we continue to be optimistic regarding our long-term future. We believe our many actions to improve our market reach, enhance our customer solutions and capabilities and to drive companywide productivity will help optimize our financial performance in the future, while affording us the opportunity to continue to invest in areas we believe have high profitable growth potential over the long-term.","Our above market sales growth, significant cash flow and robust return on invested capital through the first nine months of the year are reflective of our very positive operating performance despite some of these current industry headwinds. Our views on overall market demand for the lighting industry and items influencing costs have not really changed over the last few quarters.","So let me reiterate a few of those key items that could influence our performance in the fourth quarter and for the balance of the calendar 2019. Many independent third-party forecasts continue to suggest the overall growth rate for the North American construction market as measured in dollars will be in the low to mid single-digit range.","We still believe the lighting industry will lag the overall growth rate of the construction market, primarily due to continued product substitution to lower-priced alternatives for certain products sold through certain channels, while recent industry pricing action should have a favorable impact on growth as measured in dollars. Additionally, we expect that labor shortages in certain markets will continue to dampen growth rates for both construction and lighting.","The U.S government increased tariffs on certain imported Chinese made finished goods to 25% from 10% in May. This action resulted in many lighting companies including Acuity implementing a price increase in late May. The U.S has threatened to increase tariffs on additional Chinese made products and now Mexico as well. Though the administration recently backed off on these threats, the turmoil caused by this almost daily rhetoric in the press regarding global trade issues have certainly created greater volatility in our various end markets impacting demand.","We believe the outcome of the entire tariff situation could have a dampening effect on overall demand due to higher component costs and finished good prices. As previously mentioned, we believe the other announced price increases and other actions taken will help offset the increase in cost for various items noted earlier. While increases in some input costs such as steel have leveled off for now, we expect other costs and expenses such as imported electrical components and finished goods, freight and wages will continue to rise. These potential cost increases could have a negative impact on our financial results due to the timing and nature of any mitigation efforts, including potential future price increases and other actions to reduce costs.","Further, we believe that product substitutions to lower-priced alternatives for certain products and certain portions of the lighting market will continue, particularly for more basic lesser featured products sold through certain channels potentially pressuring both top line growth and profitability. The relaunch of our Contractor Select portfolio and other actions taken were done to enhance our opportunities for profitable growth in these or those portions of the market.","Excluding the impact, if any of those factors just noted, we remain cautiously optimistic about overall market conditions for the balance of 2019, though some leading indicators of future market demand such as the Architectural Billing Index and the Dodge Momentum Index show current softness. Our wide and varied base of customers generally remain positive about their current year growth prospects. While many customers continue to have healthy backlogs, they too are concerned about the timing of releases, particularly for larger projects and the potential impact of tariffs and inflation on overall demand and the current softness in some of these leading indicators.","However, most importantly, we expect to continue to outperform the overall growth rate of the markets we serve, primarily in North America. Further, we believe the sales of our lighting and BMS control solutions as well as our Atrius-based luminaires all within our Tier 3 and 4 categories will continue to expand, though and I would like to emphasize, it will be lumpy at times because of the unpredictability and timing of customers renovation and new construction schedules as well as the volatility in demand caused by global trade and political issues.","This next point is very important. While as a matter of policy, we don't give earnings guidance. We feel it is important for all investors and analysts to understand that we believe our net sales could be down modestly in this coming fourth quarter compared with the year ago period. The primary reason for this was that net sales last year were significantly benefited by shipments to new customers in the retail channel as part of initial stocking programs. Both initial stocking orders will not repeat this year.","The potential of this top line decline notwithstanding, we believe our adjusted operating profit margins will exceed those reported in the year ago period as well as continue to improve on a sequential basis. I would like to reemphasize those points because it will be particularly important as one thinks about their models going forward and I believe that\u2019s a favorable outcome.","Additionally, as I noted last quarter, we initiated a review this year of a portion of our product portfolio and services offered primarily through the retail channel with the objective of eliminating those items and activities that do not meet our financial objectives. These efforts have and will continue to impact our top line growth rate. However, we expect that the actions taken in this effort will be accretive to our margins as a percentage of net sales and return on invested capital.","As we\u2019ve noted before, our gross profit margin is influenced by several factors, including sales volume, innovation, components and commodity costs, market pricing dynamics and changes in product and sales channel mix. Additionally, we are always striving to improve our profitability through our continuous improvement efforts.","Lastly, the execution of our integrated tiered solutions strategy, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting, building management and our Atrius IoT platform and software solutions and our opportunities to participate in the interconnected world is an integral part of our overall long-term profitable growth strategy to meaningfully expand our addressable market by adding broad-based holistic solutions that will allow our customers to transform their connected intelligent buildings and campuses from cost centers to strategic assets.","As I\u2019ve said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building management systems market have the potential to experience solid growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and as importantly the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size to more efficient and effective solutions. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation along with our Atrius platform, we believe we are well-positioned to fully participate and lead these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you. And with that, we will now entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from the line of Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is now open.","Timothy Wojs","Hey, gentlemen. Good morning.","Ricky Reece","Good morning.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Timothy Wojs","So maybe just -- again going back to your last comments there, Vern, just on the profitability improvement that you\u2019re expecting in the fourth quarter. You mentioned that you expect EBIT to be -- EBIT margins to be up year-over-year in sequentially. Should we think the same for gross profit, just there was that headwind from the load-in on the sales line, but I also think there was a headwind not only from that load-in, but also just some negative operating costs that hit the gross profit line, the COGS line in the fourth quarter last year. So any commentary you can give us and just gross margins being higher year-over-year in the fourth quarter, that would be helpful.","Vern Nagel","Sure. So you saw that this quarter our gross profit margin improved well sequentially to 40.5% was the first time in, I believe, the last three quarters that we have exceeded 40% the gross profit margin level, the key indicator for all of you and for us internally as well. We would expect to see improvement in Q4 as well. As you know and we mentioned in the last couple of quarters because of some of the intra channel mix, customer mix within the retail channel and how we serve those customers, it is having an influence that lowers, if you will, based on historical standards our gross profit margin, but it is made up in lower SDA. We estimate that in the third quarter that impact lessened our gross profit margin by approximately 30 basis points compared with the year-ago period. So we are expecting improvements in Q4, particularly as we look at various products and product categories within our portfolio that really don't meet our margin hurdles or return on investment hurdles, so we\u2019re looking to prune that back, which I've used a very favorable activity. And so what that should do in Q4 little bit of noise going on, it will contribute to most likely lower sales in Q4, but a higher margin profile. And as Ricky and I said in our prepared remarks, we are expecting that to result in constant or consistent operating profit dollars.","Timothy Wojs","Okay. And then I guess just to be clear, you would expect gross margins to be up year-over-year in Q4 or sequentially as well?","Vern Nagel","I would expect them to be up sequentially. The headwind -- well, excuse me, for the year-ago period, we would expect them to be up pretty meaningfully above the year ago period.","Timothy Wojs","Okay, great. And then maybe just -- switching over to kind of the tariffs, what have you heard from your customer base in terms of the move from no tariffs to 10% and then just the increment move from 10% to 25%, have your customers or your channel partners being able to pass that on to customers? Is that what you've heard or have you heard any sort of pushback on that move to 25%?","Vern Nagel","So we sell-through 14 different sales channels, and so I will just comment on some of the broader ones. Certainly the move from 10% to 25% that was the situation I believe where the industry, not only the lighting industry but anybody who has product that\u2019s coming from China, that was a move too large for anyone to absorb or for the fluctuation in foreign currency to give some argument that you could absorb that. So the price increases I think are real and the end channels are passing those along to end customers because they can absorb that either. I was very pleased with our price capture in Q3. We've implemented more pricing and we expect that to continue to benefit our results. And when I say benefit our results to offset the significant tariff increases. I will remind everyone that if you go back to early September, mid-September that price increase had more to do with the cost dynamics in our industry, less to do with tariffs on finished goods. We then put in additional price increases, including the most recent price increase in May reflective of the significant increase in tariffs on Asian made finished goods.","Timothy Wojs","Okay. Okay, great. And then just kind of sneak last one in. We noticed you didn't buy any stock back in the quarter. Any thoughts on just stock down 11% here today, how you think about buybacks opportunistically would be helpful. Thanks.","Vern Nagel","Sure. So I'll take a stab at this at first, and then Ricky can comment. First of all, our stock being done 11% today is ridiculous. I mean the value of the business and the things that we're doing were enhancing the value of that. It's all good things. We are really generating a lot of cash. We are doing great things within the key markets that we serve. We are looking to prune some of the things within our business that don't really provide the kinds of returns that we expect. We have a significantly high return on invested capital, cash flow return on investment, those are important metrics to us. So we are looking to make sure that we are a better business and a growing business. You might imagine that with $334 million of cash, we are looking at all alternatives, the pipeline that Ricky has from acquisitions and strategic investments is robust. And we would expect to execute on those where we see really interesting opportunities to enhance our return. So as we\u2019ve always said in the past, if you look at how we have used our capital, our free cash flow, a third of it has gone to acquisitions, a third of it has gone to stock buybacks and the other third has been split between CapEx and dividend. So I would expect us to continue to operate in that kind of environment. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Yes, I will just add a few more comments on that. As Vern said, our first priority is acquisitions. We think that provides the greatest longer term value creation for shareholders. The pipeline is very long and very active, both for outright acquisitions as well as opportunities to invest in complementary technologies and operations. You saw after the end of the quarter, the small acquisition of WhiteOptics, but strategically that will be very important to us as we continue to advance the optics capability in some of the new form factors that are going to the market today taking advantage of the LED. So very excited about that, but clearly share buyback is on the table. We have the authorization from the Board and that\u2019s certainly an opportunity we will take good care of.","Timothy Wojs","Great. Well good luck on the rest of the year and have a happy 4th.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of John Walsh with Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","John Walsh","I guess, the first question around pricing and I think you\u2019ve articulated that there's the general inflationary price increases and then the price increases that are related to the tariffs. But I\u2019m just curious, if we were to see the tariffs disappear, what kind of industry discipline has been instilled or do you think customers would allow you to continue to capture that non-tariff inflation just because historically it has been a price down market?","Vern Nagel","Yes, my observation around that is that the industry has been for the bulk of the industry, I won't say for some of these lesser featured type products where they\u2019re subject to a bit more of global competition. I would say that the industry has generally been and I would expect it to continue to be disciplined around larger projects or what I will call specification driven projects where you're adding value by selling not only product feature differences, but you are selling service and support differences and we are seeing that. We are raising prices on some of our controls platform, primarily because there's value there and we\u2019ve experienced some cost. And I think that the industry recognizes that value and our competitors also recognize their own value. So I would expect that those types of price increases to stay in place, frankly.","Ricky Reece","I would just add, historically, we\u2019ve seen the ability to pass on commodity price increases. So for a lot of the price degradation we\u2019ve experienced over the last eight, nine years was because we were seeing declines in LED cost, efficacy of LED and so forth and the market again was passing that on. So I would just reiterate, I do think the market is pretty rational when it comes to these kind of common commodity costs, both when they go up as well as when they goes down.","Vern Nagel","And John, I would also comment that one of the reasons that we\u2019ve aggressively relaunched our Contractor Select portfolio where we\u2019ve revamped the product portfolio, if you will, based on features and benefits, but also has been maniacally focused on the cost structure within that, and that is to effectively compete in that portion of the market where to the extent that tariffs go away, we still have a strong competitive advantage, not only in the product portfolio set, but in the service set. We are modifying or service platforms, making our transactional capabilities far more frictionless and easy to do business with to compete in that world and it's an important element for us, because I don't know that pricing, while we seem to debate somewhat, particularly on product substitutions, we\u2019d expect to continue to thrive in that marketplace, even without tariffs.","John Walsh","Got you. And then maybe a follow-on here about the installed base opportunity. I mean, I feel like we've always talked about LED penetration rates through the installed base, but given the very public field failure with Detroit that everyone was speaking about at LIGHTFAIR, you've seen kind of an increased amount of marketing around product quality, whether it's from yourself, your channel partners or competitors. Is there a potential to see an acceleration of, call it Contractor Selector, this kind of Tier 1 refocused product as some of this earlier imported lights fell in the field, is that a big opportunity or is that something people talk about, but you don't actually think it's going to amount to an increased installed based opportunity?","Vern Nagel","John, that's a great question. We, Acuity, have been and are increasing our aggressiveness in communicating to our customer base both through electrical distribution to the end customer that there's a huge difference, just because something looks the same and they both say LED and they both say 5-year warranty, they're not the same. I call it internally selling the difference. And more and more, we are becoming even more aggressive at selling the difference. And this happened in the analog world. If you go back almost a decade ago, imports coming in, they didn't meet some of the standards and when you had failures that were highly publicized and more and more these failures are -- I will just call them, larger projects like the City of Detroit, that goes like wildfire through the industry. And now we are able to sell our difference, but also sell the fact that Acuity is maniacally focused solely on lighting, lighting controls, building management capability and it's our quality that we sell and our ability to support those kinds of things. So we do see it as an emerging opportunity to really sell the difference and create greater sales and greater profitability for Acuity.","John Walsh","Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Osborne with Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Osborne","Hey, good morning, guys. I was wondering if you could just put in perspective the pruning of the portfolio. You mentioned it was $12 million year-over-year. If you annualize that, is that a good number of what you've done so far and is there more room to go in terms of what you're looking to prune?","Vern Nagel","I would say that there is. The decline in our Retail segment of $12 million, that's a portion of the pruning activity, that's not all of it, it's not all in the retail channel, it's looking at various products. Just a little historical perspective. We got into some of these products by really doing a service and accommodation to certain customers sets so on and so forth. It wasn't really core to our business, but the customers were core to us. And so leveraging some of that capability and saying, yep, we will do it, it wasn't really consistent with some of the value propositions of the brands that we have. So this pruning is really, it's been a long time coming, but it's an appropriate thing to do. My guess is that it will continue to influence the next couple of quarters, particularly as we do year-over-year type comparisons and we will continue to give more insight on that. While we say it's modest, it could be two or three points of our top line, depending on how aggressively we pursue some of these things and look at alternatives. It's not just that we are going to stop doing some things, but do we want to commit resources to reengineer or engineer some new products in this area that, again, may or may not be consistent with the value proposition of brands. So we are still evaluating those types of things. But again, I want to reemphasize really important that we expect at the operating profit level for these things to be fairly neutral in terms of the actions. That's reflective of the fact that we're not making really any money on doing some of these accommodated type things and there's no reason to burn up our factories, or our balance sheet, or our people servicing that portion of the business, that is not accretive to what we're doing. So there's still I think more effort that we will be putting into this. And while it will create a little bit of noise on the top line, we think that shareholders will appreciate the benefit on the bottom line and on how we return capital to shareholders.","Jeffrey Osborne","Makes sense. And my second question, the last one is just on the Atrius. Can you just touch on how you're capturing the value for that, in terms of any metrics that you can give in terms of price premium that you\u2019ve for the product either in a per unit or square footage basis? You\u2019ve just been somewhat elusive on sort of the revenue model for Tier 3 and 4 in the past, and so it would be helpful just to understand how is that 20% of retail square footage evolves over time with the awards you have, what the financial ramifications of that are?","Vern Nagel","You know, Jeff, I don't know, if we\u2019ve been elusive on Tier 3, we apologize and that must be miscommunication. Our growth in the corporate account world for us or that enterprise solution world has been really quite positive. We are gaining share, if you will, in that space as we convert these retailers. That\u2019s why we wanted to give you all a sense that our actions to date where we say, we believe that in the big box world, more than 20% of that square footage in the U.S is under Atrius-enabled luminaires. So we earn that business and we sold those luminaires. Now what we are doing is working with these customers to really help them drive the Ferrari that they bought in terms of what it can do to their business model. And that's really been the Tier 4 opportunity for us to generate more SaaS revenues. They are, again, we're operating off the small base. But the reason that these retailers and other verticals are putting in our Atrius-based luminaires is because they are -- they believe in the future opportunity of the IoT-enabled capabilities. And so they're now experimenting with these apps. I think that if I had a learning that I would share with the group and I think Ricky and I would have said, boy, when someone transforms a single store, they are now going to start using it and putting absent, that's just not how things work. We were wrong in that premise. People want to get critical mass. Think of airports. These transformation of these airports are years in the making. While if they redo one terminal and you're a passenger going from that terminal to another terminal and its Atrius-enabled in the one terminal and then they lose you going to the other, they've created a horrible customer experience. So they are buying these luminaires, future proofing because they know that over the course of, I will call it, whatever their renovation cycle is, they're going to have that platform in place. So the Tier 4 revenues, the SaaS revenues, have been slower incoming relative to what our assumptions were three or four years ago, but we believe that the reason that they\u2019re buying these solutions, the fixtures themselves and the controls platform and all of this is because they believe strongly in the opportunity of what the Atrius IoT-enabled capability will allow them and that\u2019s why we are selling a lot of luminaires into that space.","Ricky Reece","And I would just add, our business model will enable us to capture that value over time, as Vern said, as they start driving that Ferrari or adding more and more applications and capability to it. Yes, we get a premium when we sell the hardware, but the further opportunity is once they start using the data that we are able to collect or collect additional data as we build out greater capability, or other sensors, or other companies want to use our network to transfer data and run applications and gather information that they can use to enhance the business or the productivity of the customer. So our business model allows us to continue to capture that along the way and grow the SaaS revenue and enhance their revenue on that network that we put on as they continue to use it more and more.","Jeffrey Osborne","I appreciate it. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research Partners. Your line is now open.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes, good morning. Thank you, guys. Hey.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Vern Nagel","Just a couple things from me. Good morning. Just back on the whole idea of kind of the influence of tariffs and pricing on buyers behavior. So first, do you have a sense of what the pull forward actually was in the first half of your year? And secondly, I would have thought perhaps that this move to 10% to 25% may have actually created some sort of pull forward in the current period and it seems like that didn't happen. So maybe just a little bit of additional color there would be helpful?","Vern Nagel","Sure. It's interesting and unfortunately to have precise data to answer your question, we don't have. But I have been to a number of industry events talking with distributors, contractors, different customer set. And in that dialogue with them and I will just pick distributors here for one second, they\u2019ve said, we\u2019ve been inundated at bringing in projects now and having to consume more and more of our floor space actually having to add space to house these projects that will be delivered over a more likely period of time. I believe that the move to 25%, while that may have created some pull forward, I think, you saw a lot of the pull forward kind of in that first half of the year. I think what you could actually see is projects on the 25% side potentially being delayed. And the truth of the matter is that for a lot of the product that was hit by the 25% tariff, that actually is on the more smaller, more stock flow type projects. Usually, larger projects that require more sophisticated type luminaire, we are manufacturing those types of products in our North American footprint and so we are able to through different types of sourcing so on and so forth, sell those luminaires without necessarily the pressure of -- the fulsome pressure of the tariffs. So I think, there you didn't see more pull forward of those types of things. And then on the stock flow side, I believe that folks are sitting back saying, well, how long is this going to stay. A lot of distributors, they already have enough inventory. They're not going to pull forward more when they're running out of space. So we did not see the same type of pull forward activity on the May increase, even though it was a significant increase. So it's just an interesting dynamic that's going on. It's -- and I wish, I could give you real statistics, but we just don't have them and lot of our distributor customers are struggling with what is actually happening in their business. Yes, they continue to be reasonably optimistic around their backlogs are healthy, they see some of these projects, but they too are concerned about larger projects. This is just simply taking long and I think that have more to do with steel, which fortunately has abated somewhat here. So we will see how that plays out frankly.","Jeffrey Sprague","Yes, so just maybe an additional color on large projects. So is it your view that it's just inflationary pressures, or there's something going on with the end demand picture or some other dynamic that\u2019s kind of leading this kind of extended drawing out, for lack of a better term in some of those large project activity?","Vern Nagel","Yes, it's a great question. No doubt that there are changes afloat on how people use space, use space differently so on and so forth. But I think that a lot of it has been influenced by, I hate to say this, and I -- at first, I do really accept that the notion of labor shortages were having an influence, but I think more and more a lot of these contractors, they are comfortable with their backlogs, they are comfortable with their project and their activity, as it currently is and they are saying I will get to that project later. And so I think the delay has a lot to do with just the availability of labor and to a lesser degree than expectations. Dan, as you pointed out earlier, folks maybe saying, well, if I wait, maybe these tariffs go away and the pricing will come down back to pre-tariff levels and therefore, my project looks better. We hear that anecdotally, but we don't really have good evidence around that yet.","Jeffrey Sprague","Great, thank you for the thoughts.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from the line of Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is now open.","Ryan Merkel","Hey, thanks. So first off on the low single-digit price capture. Has this been neutral to the profit line as it relates to the quarter? And then any reason this should change positive or negatively in the future?","Vern Nagel","So low digit capture, we are spreading across the whole portfolio. We would say that it has been slight positive, but we\u2019ve had to really work hard to take cost out of cost components that we can control, not just componentry that's coming in from Asia and\/or finished goods. There's still, I think more to come on the finished good side. Again, price increases just put in place in late May. We still see input coming in at a favorable rate, positive rate for those types of smaller, medium projects, but maybe that's slowed down just a tad. But I would expect that these types of activities to continue to be positive so long as they don't ultimately end up impacting overall demand. I think the bigger issue and I will let Ricky comment, I think the bigger issue still continues to be just the volatility caused by all of the rhetoric that's in the marketplace. I think that, that we see people who are busy, but they're not really actually shipping product. I think people are, again, taking a bit of wait and see approach. Ricky, your perspective on ...","Ricky Reece","Yes, I think for the low single-digit in the quarter for the most part offset the tariff increases we have. Of course, the last tariff increase came in very late in the quarter in mid May. We announced the price increase extremely quickly, but we do protect certain backlog. We had certain customers, we had to negotiate the final amount with that are under a different scenario than just distributor or someone who places an order on a daily basis. So I think, for the most part, we captured it in the third quarter, but I think there will be further margin opportunity to capture more and then maybe go beyond here in the other quarters as we don't have to protect certain projects that had already been quoted and all once we get past that.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. Yes, that makes sense. And then just to follow-up on the fourth quarter sales, so down modestly. If I were to rank sort of the pieces there, would it be first the retail comparison that's pretty tough, I think it was 500 basis points of growth last year, I think, that's what you quantified? And then secondly, eliminating some products maybe 2% to 3% negative impact and then would the last piece just be the pull forward into the first half?","Vern Nagel","I would say that the first two are directionally correct. I would say that when you get into our fourth quarter and then imagine where projects pull forward all the way from the fourth quarter into the first half, I would say probably not as much. I don't know that I would influence that. We are still trying to handicap, as Ricky pointed out in answering the previous question, what impact is the May price increase having. Right now, we are not seeing that it's having a huge pull forward impact. So I would say as you think about the Q4, the first two were directionally correct, and again, I'd like to really emphasize because this is going to be important for how all of you write your reports. Our expectation is that we are going to continue to see our profit measures improve and we will go a long way to offsetting some of that top line decline because of just the mix of it. So it's important that everyone understand that as it create some of their models.","Ryan Merkel","Very helpful. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. And that does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Mr. Vernon Nagel for any further remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you everyone for your time this morning. I realize that some of the questions around top line for Q4 very important as you think about your models. But again, we are really focused on not only growing our business, but profitably growing our business and making sure that we are doing it in areas that provide us with the kinds of return on capital and the margin improvements that we are after. So please understand that, know that we are focused on it. I think as you do your models you find it to be a very favorable outcome. Any way, we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that have the potential over the long-term to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Again, our future is bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference. This does conclude today\u2019s program.

After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you, and good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2017 fourth quarter and full-year results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We are webcasting today's conference call at acuitybrands.com. I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now, let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning everyone. First of all, I apologize, I'm fighting a little bit of a cold here, but we will work through this. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments, and then we will be happy to answer your questions.","While our results for the fourth quarter and the full-year were records, we had higher expectations coming into 2017. Market conditions were far more subdued from a growth perspective than most had originally expected, as demand remained flat throughout much of the year. Our results for the quarter and the full-year reflected solid performance given these market conditions, while our strategic accomplishments this year were very significant as I'll describe later in the call.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights, first for the fourth quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were a record $958 million, an increase of almost 4% compared with the year-ago period. Reported operating profit was $153 million compared with the $135 million in the year-ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $2.15 compared with the $1.89 in the year-ago period.","There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain other add-backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods, as Ricky will explain later in the call. And adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 was $176 million, a quarterly record, compared with adjusted operating profit of $157 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 13%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 18.4%, an increase of 150 basis points compared with the margin reported in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.55, up 15% from the year-ago period.","For the full-year, Acuity's net sales were a record $3.5 billion, up almost 7% from 2016. Reported operating profit was $519 million compared with $475 million in the year-ago period, while diluted earnings per share was $7.43, up 12% from a year-ago. Adjusted operating profit was $592 million, up 7% from a year-ago. Adjusted operating profit margin in 2017 was 16.9%, the same as the year earlier.","Our adjusted variable contribution margin was about 17% for the full-year, not bad after a weak first half. Adjusted diluted EPS was $8.45, up 8% from 2016. In addition, we'd generated a solid $316 million in net cash provided from operating activities this year. We closed the year with $311 million in cash on hand even after repurchasing $358 million of the company shares, investing $67 million for capital expenditures and funding $23 million in dividends this year, leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our growth strategies.","Lastly, I'm pleased to report that we once again earned much more than our cost of capital. Our adjusted cash flow return on investment for 2017 was almost 35%, a record, and up about a point from that earned in 2016. We believe this level of return is far greater than others in the electrical industry. For those who follow EVA, we generated over $170 million in positive EVA, an astounding achievement.","Looking at the key highlights for the fourth quarter, net sales in the quarter were up almost 4% over the year-ago period, overall sales volume grew approximately 5%. This was offset by approximately one point for changes in the price mix of products sold. While it's not possible to precisely determine separate impacted changes in the price and the mix of products sold, we estimate impact of price mix was primarily due to changes in product price, primarily for more basic lesser-featured LED luminaires sold in certain channels.","Overall, the increase in net sales was reasonably broad based, some of our key product lines and sales channels in the U.S. and Canada with normal variability within each grouping. Additionally, we believe overall market demand remain soft during the quarter.","To add a bit more color on this, while available market data does not line up perfectly with our quarters, initial information from various organization, while varied suggest shipments of lighting fixtures in the United States was flat to slightly down when compared with the year-ago period, and consistent with the level of demand sequentially from the third quarter. Nonetheless, we were still able to grow our net sales in U.S. and Canada by approximately 5% this quarter far outpacing the growth rate of the overall lighting industry allowing us to continue to gain market share. I will comment more on our expectations for 2018 later in the call.","Sales of LED products grew robustly again this quarter, and now account for more than two-thirds of our total net sales, which as you know includes the sale of non-fixture related products and solutions as well. Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative, and holistic lighting and building management solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve solid sales growth and market share gain this quarter, particularly against the backdrop of a soft market environment.","Our profitability measures for the fourth quarter were solid, but impacted by current tepid market conditions. Our adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter was a quarterly record of $163 million, up almost $20 million compared with the year-ago period, while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 18.4%, up 150 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. The increase in the adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales, partially offset by lower adjusted gross profit margin.","Gross profit margin for the fourth quarter was 42.5%, a decrease of 100 basis points compared with the year-ago period. Gross profit and gross profit margin were negatively impacted by higher cost for certain items including product warranty and commodities, particularly steel and to a lesser degree the impact of price mix changes. This was partially offset by lower cost for certain components and productivity improvements primarily from previously announced streamlining actions.","We continue to aggressively address these issues by accelerating programs to reduce cost, particularly for certain basic less differentiated product families and to expand our overall competitiveness and to improve our profitability. Next, adjusted SDA expenses were down $15.2 million compared to the year-ago period. Adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sells was 24.1% in the fourth quarter, a decrease of 250 basis points from the year-ago period.","The decrease in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by greater salary and healthcare cost due to continued investment in additional head count that support and drive our tiered solution strategy. Our incentive compensation program is based on period-over-period improvement for our key financial metrics, which are an integral part of our pay-for-performance culture.","Our performance this year has resulted in a much lower earned payout than in the year-ago period. Our adjusted diluted EPS was $2.55. A quarterly record compared with $2.21 reported in the year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to a 12% increase in pretax income and lower shares outstanding, partially offset by a higher tax rate in the quarter. The lower average shares outstanding was due to the stock repurchases in the third quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this year. On the strategic and technology front, we continue to make great strides setting the stage for what we believe will be strong revenue growth and profitability over the long term. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions along the entire value chain, expanding our industry leading portfolio of cost effective, innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as our building management capabilities.","Many of these solutions are connected to our IoT software platform as innovation continues to be at the forefront of our tiered solution strategy. While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up almost 30% this quarter and now represent 15% of our total sales.","In May, we announced our Atrius brand, encompassing our portfolio of IoT business solutions and our Atrius software platform, which as you know has been developed over the last few years. This software platform is a robust, scalable, and secure platform that enables an array of capabilities including indoor positioning, asset tracking, space utilization, spatial analytics, and energy management. For example, the Atrius solution builder provides a comprehensive development environment for customers and partners to build IoT solutions that consume data from our vast sensory network and from other third-party sensors. In fact, since the introduction of this incredible platform a growing number of some of the industry's leading technology of software providers are utilizing data from our Atrius IoT platform and using our software solutions to deliver their own unique and valuable capabilities and solutions to their customers.","Interest in our Atrius platform is significant and we expect to continue to add additional user partners. Through our Atrius platform, we will continue to provide and expand our comprehensive set of IoT business solutions built on our unique capability to collect extensive and valuable sensory data through intelligent luminaires, lighting and building management controls, software platform services and development, developmental tools.","These solutions deliver connectivity and intelligence to a space be an expansive network of smart LED lighting and controls and a software platform that gathers, unlocks and transforms large data to enable a broad range of software solutions addressing critical business challenges all while delivering a superior visual environment and significant energy savings. Atrius solutions have already - has already been deployed across nearly 90 million square feet of indoor spaces leveraging more than 1.7 million network sensors.","Additionally, the installed base of Acuity Brands network lighting systems encompassing more than a billion square feet can now be upgraded to a more multi-functional Atrius sensory network that can supply IOT data to this robust platform. From a commercial perspective, we have deployment and active pilot with several of the largest U.S. base and certain European retailers as well as other key vertical applications including certain airports.","These commitments and orders from both customers accelerating the expansion of their current platforms as well as customers moving beyond pilot programs to implementation deploying the Atrius IoT Platform, including our comprehensive lighting and building management solutions look for unique and value added capabilities and solutions to enhance their businesses and potentially allowing us the opportunity to meaningfully expand our installed base of Atrius enabled systems over the next 12 to 18 months. And this does not include the potential growth opportunities for new customers and partners again from which, there is great interest in deploying our Atrius platform and solutions.","Importantly, we have added and will continue to add new technologies, capabilities and analytical features to our Atrius Solution platform creating a more comprehensive full suite of IoT solutions that are well beyond proof of concept stage that we believe will continue to contribute to accelerate growth in our Tier 3 and 4 solutions.","Lastly, we continue to expand our industry leadership position in our Tier 1 and Tier 2 products and solutions particularly for lesser featured entry level products, we have been able to create these capabilities while providing industry leading results because of the dedication we resolve for more than 12,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers.","I'll talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction markets later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for fiscal 2018. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern and good morning everyone. As Vern noted, we had a record fourth quarter and full-year results, however I had some further insights to our financial performance for the fourth quarter and year ended August 31, 2017. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2017 and 2016 which we find useful to add back and order for the results to be comparable.","In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for both the fourth quarter and full fiscal year. Primarily, due to the impact of the four acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets, share based compensation expense since we used restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to align the interest of key leaders of acquired businesses with those of shareholders, special charges as we streamline and integrated recent acquisitions, other acquisition related items including acquire profit in inventory, professional fees and certain contract termination cost and impairment of intangible assets as we rationalized acquire trade names.","Additionally, fiscal 2017 adjusted results exclude a gain associated with the sale of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you'll find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. In addition, many of our peer companies especially as we become more of a technology company make similar adjustments so will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.","During the fourth quarter and full-year of fiscal 2017, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $9.6 million and $11.3 million respectively, the fourth quarter charge consists primarily of severance and employee related benefit costs for the elimination of certain operations and positions following a realignment of our operating structure including positions within various SD&A departments.","We expect to realize annualized savings well in excess of the fourth quarter charge, we intend to reinvest these savings in our business primarily an additional headcount to support and drive our Tiered solution strategy. During the fourth quarter and full-year of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $4.9 million and $15 million respectively for actions initiated to streamline the organization including the integration of recent acquisitions. We had miscellaneous expense of $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted earnings per share reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2017 was comprised primarily of losses associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.","In the fourth quarter of last year, we reported net miscellaneous income of $0.1 million. The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 36.4% compared with 34.8% in the fourth quarter of last year, we expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 to once again be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","Net cash provided by operating activities total $316.2 million for fiscal year 2017 compared with $345.7 million for the year-ago period. At August 31, 2017 operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables was $40 million higher than the prior year and equaled 44 days compared with 38 days a year-ago, most of this increase was in inventory due to a build up early in the fiscal year to support increased sales volumes and improved service to customers. We were able to reduce inventories by approximately $25 million in the second half of fiscal year 2017 while improving our service levels which exhibits the power of our supply chain using Acuity Business Systems and the application of lean principles.","In fiscal year 2017, we spent $67.3 million on capital expenditures which is a reduction of 20% compared to the prior year. This decline in capital spending was primarily due to reduced spending associated with facility enhancements compared to the year-ago period.","Capital spending as a percentage of sales was 1.9% in fiscal 2017 and we currently expect to spend approximately 2% of sales in fiscal year 2018. In fiscal 2017, we repurchased 2 million shares of our common stock for $357.9 million and paid dividends of $22.7 million. We returned to our shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and cash dividends over $318 million which is significantly more than the $316 million of cash we generated from operations in this year.","At August 31, 2017, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $311.1 million a decrease of $102.1 million since August 31, 2016, the decrease was due primarily to cash used to repurchase stock, invest in capital expenditures and paid dividends. Our total debt outstanding was $356.9 million at August 31, 2017.","Our debt to total capitalization at fiscal 2017 year-end was 17.7% and net debt to capital was 2.7%. We had additional borrowing capacity of $244.7 million at August 31, 2017 under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility and we will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you. And I'll now turn it back over to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. At Acuity, we remain very bullish regarding our future, despite recent market softness. We continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever changing and evolving in a positive direction for our company. We are often asked about the vitality and conditions of the key end markets we serve. We now know that the overall growth rate of the lighting market over the last two quarters was essentially flat and even slightly down compared with a year-ago periods. This was considerably different from the growth rate anticipated by various forecasting organizations at the start of the year.","Many reasons have been cited for this softness including among others, lack of skill labor, uncertainty over tax regulations and pricing pressures in certain end markets for certain less feature products. While all of this is true to varying degrees, we continue to pull our vast customer base and excuse me and from the majority we hear optimism regarding the prospects for future growth.","Generally speaking, the trades are busy and backlogs are favorable. Having said that, well forecast from various data sources we collected very widely, the consensus estimate suggest that growth through the lighting fixture market, could remain sluggish for the next few quarters especially giving the devastating impact of recent hurricanes in certain areas and then rebounding in the second half of our fiscal 2018.","Therefore, we remain bullish regarding the company's long-term prospects for continued profitable growth particularly as we bring more value-added solutions the market for both new constructions and a conversion of the installed base. While this tamped market conditions may be with us in the short-term, we continue to see science that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve.","Leading indicators for the North American market such as architecture billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment cost continue to improve at varying paces, which gives us optimism for growth beyond the current market as dealers for 2018.","So, following few of our key assumptions for our fiscal 2018, given the information I just noted. We expect the lighting market North America are largest market to experience low single-digit growth for a full fiscal 2018, reflecting the expected rebound in the second half for the year.","Additionally and most importantly, we expect the continued outperform the overall growth rate of the markets we serve. Next we expect the price of certain LED components to continue to decline go at a decelerating pace. While certain other costs including certain components and commodity cost are specially steel prices as well as certain employee-related costs primarily due to further investments in associate headcount, wage inflation and healthcare cost will increase somewhat. We expect to mitigate some of the impact of these rising costs through certain pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and product cost reductions, while the timing of these initiatives might lack the timing of these increased costs.","Next, we continue to be leery of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are always unpredictable. Additionally while our gross profit margin is influenced by several factors, including sales volume, innovation, components and commodity cost, market level pricing, and changes in the mix of products and sales channels, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow or mix evolves and we execute our tiered solutions strategies and as we realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","Expansion of our gross profit margin is a key focus for us in 2018. Further, we continue to target a current variable contribution margin on an incremental dollar basis in the mid to upper 20% range over a full-year period knowing that is not possible to predict with precision what the rate will be by quarter. I would point out that our variable contribution margin in the second half of 2017 was 30% over the second half of 2016.","Next, our adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of sales was approximately 25.4% in 2017. This is below our recent annual trend, primarily due to much lower incentive compensation expense. Trust me, we are motivated to drive strong period-over-period growth, which is at the core of our pay-for-performance culture. This would result in much higher incentive compensation expense in 2018 compared with 2017.","So as you consider your financial models, we would expect our adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales to be closer to our historical trend, assuming will continue to meaningfully outpace the growth rates of the markets we serve and we enhance our company wide productivity, helping us to expand our gross margins towards historical trend. So to be very clear, our focus is to garner additional top line growth, driven primarily by our ability to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve, continue to move the mix of products and solutions as we execute our tiered solutions strategy, and to leverage our infrastructure achieving targeted incremental margins to improve our overall profitability.","Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by and focused on the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our tier 3 and tier 4 holistic lighting, building management, and Atrius IoT platform and software solutions. As I noted earlier, we are now converting certain customers to implementation from pilot programs. And we continue to expand the number of pilot programs with customers for these smart platforms and continue to experience strong interest for many other key customers and potential partners in multiple verticals to deploy our holistic solutions with these unique capabilities and more.","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in interconnected world is an integral part of our overall growth strategy to meaningfully expand our addressable market by adding significantly greater broad-based holistic solutions that will allow our customers to optimize the performance of their facilities.","As we noted earlier, while we are in very early stage of the game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for our tier 3 and 4 categories as well as the acceptance of our IoT enabled smart platform solutions, particularly with the launch of our Atrius platform. Our company wide strategy is straightforward. Expand and leverage our industry leading product and solutions portfolio coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns.","This all takes focus and resources. We are investing today to enhance and expand our core competencies, affording us the opportunity to excel in our fast changing industry because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we are significantly expanding our addressable market. Our strong growth record supports this view. As I said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction, more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, to more efficient and effective solutions. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation along with our Atrius platform, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Hi, thanks. Good morning everyone.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Ryan Merkel","So first, I wanted to ask about Chinese competition at the low end of the market, and I am wondering what percent of sales would this impact and is lower pricing impacting the stock in flow business?","Vern Nagel","It's apparent there are all sorts of different information; I get emails probably like many of you do with china.com. It is becoming more and more clear that the folks there and some of these manufacturers are being subsidized, if you will, to come into these markets. We actually have seen some data around that. I believe that at the margin, it's probably impacting some of the pricing for certain channels for certain of these lower de-featured products. But I would say that, overall, when we look at our price mix and I talk to our customer base, they are seeing some impact but I would not say it's a material impact, whether the product has the quality and the features that they are after, too often to the untrained eyes, someone says, \"I have this product at this price.\" But for most folks who are purchasing these kinds of products, they actually have a level of knowledge of what they are putting in. And so, they understand that potential price is not really indicative of the value that they are after. I can't give you a percentage of -- I actually don't know, of what some of these products' price point would be. We see them being fairly narrow in what they are targeting. And so, I don't consider this to be a meaningful impact on some of the things that we are doing.","Price competition in the marketplace in general, I think continues to be probably at a bit more of an aggressive level overall as demand has slowed down a little bit. But for us, overall price mix, and we think that price mix it was a point was mostly priced mostly LED luminaires and mostly due to the -- if you will, decline in component level pricing, which we feel is decelerating. So, I know I am not giving you a specific answer to your question, but I see that the china.com sort of syndrome is in a very, very small select group of products.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. No, that's helpful. I mean that's kind of what I was looking for, at least some direction there, and my thought process was that it was a smaller piece of what you do. And then secondly, when is the supply chain disruption going to be behind us? And when do you see gross margins rising year-over-year again?","Vern Nagel","Sure. So, I believe that the gross margin -- excuse me; the supply chain issues are behind us. We've actually seen great stability and improvement in our productivity. Some of the year-over-year cost that we had in increasing certain benefits to stabilize the workforce, we're now starting to annualize those, but when I -- when we look at our productivity within the supply chain, they are in a very favorable trend.","A couple of other things that have impacted us, when we talk about price mix being about a point with most of it being priced, that's flowing through. It's being offset to a large degree by component cost savings, but when we look at steel, steel has definitely been eating into the margin capability. So, we are now looking to, if you will, cost out. As an example, redesign certain products that contain more steel than what we can design, if you will too. And we are also looking at certain pricing opportunities to evolve that. I am actually bullish, the long-term prospects for our gross profit margin because of our ability to leverage.","Some of the margin issue just to also talk a little bit about warranty, you know, we've expanded and we've been growing in our outdoor and our utility space, and part of the warranty cost have been the event of extended warranties. So it's really just Acuity, if you will, meeting market conditions, but yet we recognize that if you will, warranty cost when we make that sale, and it's a higher portion of the expense than what it has been historically, where warranties have been in the more normal range of a year or so.","So, I think that you are going to see gross profit margins improve for the full-year 2018. It's always impossible for us to predict. I know you all want us see it predicted to the tenth of a basis point each quarter, but I feel that the trends that we have and what we are focusing on will be favorable for us in 2018 and beyond. As I said in my prepared remarks, gross profit margin is -- and improvement there is an intense focus for us.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question will come from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open.","Rich Kwas","Hi, good morning everyone. Just a couple of questions; one on the market, Vern, can you give us some clarity on what's happening between renovation, retrofit, and new construction? Earlier in the year project activity is pretty robust and would seem like new construction on the non-res side is picking up some steam. What are the implications given the overall growth rate for the retrofit renovation market that seems that slowdown a bit here over the course of last few quarters, just an update there and your thoughts and the outlook for fiscal '18?","Vern Nagel","Rich, it's interesting to us. I have in front of me just some data that Dan provided to me, and when we look at, you know, this is -- excuse me, this is construction spent, it's for August, right. So, this not the lighting market, but it's just interesting, non-residential both private and public down in the month of August. July was not terribly dissimilar, but yet when we talk to the trades, when we talk to architects, engineers, contractors, people generally speaking are busy and backlogs are building. So, the release of some of these things are just taking a bit longer. It's all over the board, frankly. Again, in one market, folks will say, \"Well, it's because we are having difficulty finding labor,\" and in other market they say, \"No, that's not the issue, it's people waiting to see whether they are going to be able to get a pull right off of their renovation or the upgrading of their facility.\"","So, all of this to us suggest that there is still pent-up demand. We believe that the smaller short cycle project has slowed down a little bit. Some folks have tried to guess, well, how much pricing as a part of that. There is probably a little bit of that, but generally speaking, the markets that we see and the markets that we serve and we seem them all by the way, have favorability, and yet the words in the music don't seem to quite match. And so, we sit back and say, \"Okay, our customer base is telling us that they have these things, we can see this project cancellations don't seem to be happening. It seems that things are getting pushed out a little bit.\" So, at Acuity, we remain favorable on what the market trend is going to be, not in the very, very short-term but overall both for full '18 and going into '19, because of just again more of the macro type trends. And then we will get into specific aspects of the business. We see opportunities; I mean, look at our Tier 3 solutions there. That is project-based business typically, and it continues to grow at a favorable rate, people are interested in adding luminaires with technology. So, we are seeing growth there. It's on that smaller project side that we seem to be experiencing more of the slowdown. I just -- I see as we add more value into that chain or into the channel, I see growth continuing.","Rich Kwas","Okay. And then, just a follow-up, your comments around SD&A as a percent of sale, so this is a near-term trough this year, meaning fiscal '17, how should we think about the expected increase for 2018? Because you have some bogies for earnings growth, EPS growth, operating margins et cetera that you target to get paid, and I'm just curious, you know, do we think that the -- the SD&A as a percent of sale goes back that 27% range, or is that more subdued than that as we think about the next year?","Vern Nagel","Yes. Listen, for us to earn incentive compensation at Acuity, all salaried people are on some form of incentive compensation. It's all based on period-over-period improvement. So, just to make it easy for you, I will pick -- the three areas are operating profit dollars for most people, so growth in operating profit dollars, improvement in operating profit margin, and cash flow. And so, each of those things have to improve on a year-over-year basis, so there is a maniacal focus on driving solutions that's for the customers to make that happen.","I think that as we think about where our business should be, we need to have top line growth and margin improvement to really earn, if you will, incentive comp. We are going to continue to invest in headcount along our tiered solutions strategy. This year, we added almost 400 folks to our salary headcount, almost 13%. I don't think it will be as much next year, that's why we are targeting our variable contribution margin to still be in that mid to upper 20s expecting to really leverage what we are doing.","So, as I think about your models, I think that something north of 26% as a percentage of sales is probably in the range of reasonableness. I think 27 is probably a little too high. We are getting leverage as we grow our business on our SDA, but the key is how we continue to improve margins, we are seeing steel that kind of level off, which is favorable. I don't know if they will stay that way. We are driving productivity throughout our company, our supply chain is kicking along, I think that some of the warranty issues that we've had will still continue to pursue aggressively. The outdoor and the utility market, we are again - we are matching competitive, if you will, pressures around those things, but on a year-over-year basis as that basis grows, we will see additional warranty as a percentage of our sales. So, that will be a drag if you will on gross profit. So, your model, it's gross profit - it's top line growth, it's gross profit improvement because of the things that we are doing and it's leveraging our SDA, but leveraging at probably more in the 26-plus percent range.","Rich Kwas","Okay. Thank you for the color.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Sophie Karp","Hi, good morning, and thank you for taking my question. I have a question on your capital allocation strategy here, maybe have you guys considered raising your dividend or changing what you've been doing given that the cash flow is pretty healthy and the dividend yield is low, and it seems like the growth has been slow recently, so it that something that could be up for consideration?","Vern Nagel","So, each quarter, the board reviews our dividend policy, if you will. And so, we feel comfortable with where the dividend is. We continue to see really significant growth opportunities, I think if you look at over the last six years, seven years, we've deployed in acquisitions using both cash and our stock, but close to a billion or two, somewhere in that range, I think.","Ricky Reece","Right.","Vern Nagel","And so, the pipeline of opportunity, both for investment, partnership relationship, straight-out acquisitions, continues to be robust for us. But as you know, acquisitions are impossible to predict, and so they are lumpy. And we used almost $380 million in our third quarter to repurchase stock. So, our focus is how do we drive strategy of the business? So, it's acquisitions and commercial relationships first, stock repurchases second, and then lastly what is our dividend policy. I'm very proud of the organization in terms of what we delivered, our cash flow return on investment, and what was arguably a very tough market environment, we continue to manage our business very well, we paid for some of that through incentive compensation programs, but all of us believe strongly that the growth opportunities and the ability to drive superior returns on our invested capital are well-available to the organization. And so, most shareholders have encouraged us to deploy the capital back into the business, because we are generating such strong returns after that. But just to be clear, we look at that on a regular basis. Ricky, do you have any additional thoughts?","Ricky Reece","I will just reiterate that acquisitions is clearly been an area where we think we have created value over time, and is the highest priority. We see a lot of opportunities in the M&A space to continue to build out, whether it's filling product gaps, whether it's acquiring greater technology or access to market, and then geographic expansion is certainly an option, at one point today we are still 97%, North America focused as well. We are very strong here in North America. There is a huge growth opportunity for us geographically. So, we still see a lot of growth engines to use that cash flow in the M&A area.","Vern Nagel","Sophie, I would also add, we spent a lot of time talking with our shareholder base and both current shareholders as well as perspective shareholders and we talked a lot about this very topic, and given the growth potential that our industry has over the next decade given the significant position that we have in the broad industry, and it's being redefined by the way, and for the opportunities of the interconnected world coming to our space to add an investment into that, it's really a growth environment. So, the capital ebbs and flows a little bit, but we see the growth opportunity, that's really why we are, if you will, holding our powder dry\u2026","Sophie Karp","All right, thank you, this is helpful. And then, my another question was, this environment where like you said the bookings seem to be strong, but they conversion to sales seems to be slow, I assume it's a little bit puzzling for I guess us, analysts and investors as well. Have you seen similar dynamic in prior cycles? And what could this be indicative of? And how in your experiences this could ultimately get resolved?","Vern Nagel","Yes. So, prior cycles have typically experienced a greater boom, if you will, then followed by a greater decline. This recovery, and I won't play economist here, you all know it better than me, but this recovery has been long and slow. And so, we do not necessarily see the speculative overbuild, I'm talking broadly, you can pick some market and say oh, no, residential is bubble again in this area. We just don't see the speculative overbuild broadly defined in both non-residential as well as residential. Obviously, some markets not withstanding.","So, it feels to us like what is -- we've grown to a fairly high level in terms of dollar value, but why are we taking a breather right now? All of the indicators that we see the people that we talked to would suggest that this is a temporary law and I don't know that there is something historically that I can drawback on to say that ultimately this looks that way. In fact we have the opposite view. We see more and more people interested in writing solutions both new construction as well as if you will renovation of existing spaces to take advantage of energy savings, to take advantage of the IOT capabilities that Acuity is uniquely positioned to offer. We are just at a high level and we are kind of holding that pattern right and but we are not seeing the kind of growth that we think is pent up and available to us. The installed base is still significantly under converted. I think we are talking hundred millions of dollars of opportunity. Why is it not moving faster at this stage? I can give you all of the things I hear but it's impossible for me to say it's this specific reason.","Sophie Karp","Got it. Thank you. It's helpful. I will jump back on the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt McCall with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is now open.","Matt McCall","Thank you. Good morning guys.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Matt McCall","Vern, I just want to clarify, you hit the margin question a few times, but just making sure I have all the puts in the undertakes. So you talk about the 25% to 30% I understand it's on a full-year basis. But and you gave some insight into the SD&A while we expect that to be - talk a little bit about gross margin and the expectation I know you say is going to show some improvement next year, but maybe one or some of the components of that improvement, some of the offsets of headcount additions or if there are headcount additions there, just I know you are going to eliminate some issues this year that will help next year. I'm just trying to understand, what kind of visibility you have in that gross margin number. What kind of assumptions you having to make to get us into that 25% or 30% contribution margin for the full-year?","Vern Nagel","So historically over the last couple of years been able to reasonably be in that mid to upper 20 variable contributions. 2017, it was a rough start. So if you all remember coming out of the fourth quarter of 2016, the disruption at that point in time to the supply chain was heavy turnover particularly at a couple of our facilities in Mexico, where there are fantastic facilities. But other competitor, excuse me other companies were coming in there and competing for labor to look forward as an example was one of those folks, so they started to ram up then they pullback. So we've been able to significantly stabilize our workforce, we provided some additional benefits to be competitive, we have now in the second half of our fiscal 2017 addressed those issues and actually were driving productivity gains again. So we have offset some of those costs. I think the headwinds on the gross profit margin were mix, right. So, mix has a bit of an issue that flows through dollar-for-dollar at the gross profit level actually flows Q2 operating profit.","Number two, we experienced, if you will, cost declines in certain LEDs, but those things are offset a little bit by the pricing in products, steel costs rose reasonably significantly in 2017, you guys could see the trend there you know how much steel we use. So, pricing in some of those markets for some of those products we're able to do some pricing, some price increases, in other areas we're offsetting that or looking to offset that through cost outs, through engineering redesign.","So, our feeling is that steel prices maybe level off a little bit given overall market demand plus our ability to price, take pricing actions as well as our ability to cost out certain things, we see improvements there, traditional productivity improvements we'll continue to do that and some of the warranty costs while I would expect them because some of that has to do with us simply meeting market competitive levels around extended warranties is that portion of the business expands we'll still see a little bit of an uptick there. But I'm expecting that we will have improvements in our overall product quality that will help us drive improvements in our margin there as well.","And then lastly, our expectation is that along our entire Tier solution strategy, we're continuing to make design changes, we're continuing to enhance the mix to more featured and more capable products and even in those areas where you have a feature Tier 1 solution set, our team is robustly focused on driving opportunities there to be extremely competitive with anyone who enters the market not just pricing those markets people care about quality, they care about delivery, they care about innovation, they care about training. So Acuity doesn't always need to absolutely be the lowest price to really be the best value for people and lot of our customer sets understand how to merchandize that the right way.","Matt McCall","Okay. All right, that's helpful. And the other question I had, you mentioned the hurricane kind of the near term drag, any estimate of what the pressure is going to be, I think you said over the next couple of few quarters you could see some pressure if I heard you correctly any estimates on what the near term drag could be and is there a longer term opportunity at all, I wouldn't think there's much but\u2026","Ricky Reece","You know Matt, at the end of the day I don't know what the end of the day will be all the stuff will level itself out but if you look at the port folks in Houston, you look at the port folks in Florida, Puerto Rico, our agents and their customers were out of business for a while. And now best business is starting to come back, it's coming back at a measured pace eventually all of that is stuff that was damaged there is going to need to be replaced and so that will be an accelerant ultimately. I just think that in the shorter term, I don't know is that a quarter, is that two quarters, I just think it will have some drag on the broad opportunity of those markets than converting to an accelerant as people start to repair out. I would also say labor in those markets is going to be a serious issue.","Dan Smith","Ricky, you -- I've been in the hurricane tracker here lately you think like I was in Houston when Harvey hit and I was in Florida when Irma hit, so don't ask me to come to your city.","Matt McCall","Okay, you're doing it wrong. And I'm sorry, Dan, for one more, I just want to make sure I understood some of these about the incremental margin, so the mid to high 20 that you're targeting that's an all-in number for the next year's expectation that is with the return of bonuses, that's an all-in expectation.","Dan Smith","Correct.","Matt McCall","Okay. All right, thank you guys.","Vern Nagel","Yes, we have to pay for our incentive compensation, it's not period over period results and in those results of improvement, you have to pay for your own incentive compensation. So that's correct, it's inclusive.","Matt McCall","Okay, okay. Just clarified, thank you, Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question will come from John Quealy with Canaccord. Your line is open.","John Quealy","Hey, good morning, folks. First question please just big picture as we think about the investments that we're doing in people and process in '18 to support a number of different things, just big picture as we get into '19 does that cadence slowdown, revenue being put aside for this question but this investment period do we see a year type track or we're just going to keep doing it as long as the market is there?","Vern Nagel","Well, with that last caveat we will always invest as long as we see the market potential but our current expectation is that 2018 is still, if you will, a year of investing, I think that as you get into '19 and '20 we continue to invest that we start to harvest some of that investment, so our expectation is that, our variable contribution margins in that '19, '20 and beyond period start to expand fairly meaningfully. That does not mean by the way that we won't continue to invest in our business, it just means that we will be leveraging more and more of the phase that we have established.","And this is throughout our business, it's interesting to me when I think about our company over the last just four years the non-residential market which is a benchmark that most of you use to gauge Acuity success on an inflation adjusted basis, it still hasn't come back to 2008 levels but yet in the last four years, we've grown our top line by two-thirds, we've improved our gross profit margin by 250 basis points, we've improved our operating profit margin by 400 basis points and our operating profit dollars are two and half times as high as they were.","So, you think about the formidable base that Acuity has been able to create in a marketplace that began the way you measuring it under inflation adjusted basis, it's still not back to its historical high, I think that's a testament to the investments and the returns that we're getting off of our investments to expand our portfolio, to expand our access to market and to really drive our capabilities in this technology market. I mean, the fact of the matter is that Tier 3 sales today represent probably 15% or a little bit more of our business and yet those things didn't exist four years ago. So, we're getting to returns that are there and we want to continue to drive that in a robust way but the short answer to your question is we would expect as we get into 2019 and 2020 to start to see the variable contribution margin half of our business and half of the sales dollar improved.","John Quealy","Okay, thank you. My last piece on Atrius, so that 350 million square feet type number that we've talked about the last year, do you need other technologies to get there as you know building based locational services technologies pretty dynamic, what else can you put into that Atrius toolbox and does that expand the opportunity longer term? Thanks guys.","Vern Nagel","Yes, there are other technologies that we will continue to add, I prefer not to talk about that until we actually introduce those capabilities but I believe that what Atrius is really a quilt of capabilities, there will be no one particular silver bullet that says this is why you buy Atrius, you're buying Atrius because it can take advantage of a mass of sensory network ubiquitous nature of lighting and the fact that lighting will convert from conventional lighting to LED lighting because of the energy savings to pay for really that conversion and with the Atrius or with Acuity and Atrius enabled solution set, you get all these features and benefits that will continue to expand the features and benefits that users will have, again between building management and lighting and lighting control, we believe that's north of 85% of all the data that's being generated and building can be collected off of those systems and the Atrius platform allows us to enhance that using third-party sensors as well.","So, our belief is that the Atrius platform literally will be able to collect 100% of the information being generated inside of building and then use at to build, help the building due to things that needs to do efficiency wise and then business solution wise, and now we're tying at into our outdoor capability so, we see this as a robust platform that will always be adding new technologies and new capability.","Ricky Reece","And I would add while we will be adding capabilities in all of this sensory platform. We were also be working with other technology partners to bring in some of their capabilities to enhance the overall solution capability that we can deliver using that sensory network of Atrius so, it's not all that we're going to need to do ourselves. We can partner with it and are partnering with other very formidable technology companies to help build out the full solutions suite and capability that we believe Atrius can provide.","Operator","Our next question will come from Vishal Shah with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vishal Shah","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to just better understand your Tier 2, Tier 4 pilot projects can you expand on and what you seeing there and when you can expect to convert some of those pilot projects into in your awards and then secondly on going back to question, the point of margins, you mentioned that you're going to have some pricing initiatives as part of the margin expansion strategy in 2018. Can you talk about what your feedback has been so far from the customers? And do we see the margin expansion more of towards second half 2018 story or do you see some of that playing out even before that? Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Yes. So, on the margin question, I'll address that first. Our expectations that all of the things that we're doing we'll continue to see margin improvement. I don't want to go on quarter-by-quarter and I think that's a very difficult challenge because mix place a big part in that but if I think about the full-year and the activities that we have going on we see favorable trends as I mentioned.","Our productivity in our supply chain robustly positive, I think will start to anniversary some of these steel increases so, that should be less of a drag we're working hard as we create new products to think about how do we position that features and benefits but we have a cost process that allows us to improve our margins we're very focused on how do we cost out existing designs where these products still have a lot of life left in them, if you will, from a lifecycle perspective. So I think you're going to see an improvement that kind of fairly consistent basis I just Ricky would be reluctant to try and say what does that look like by quarter. You will see improvement. It's a maniacal focus that we have this year. And then the first question was\u2026","Vishal Shah","Tier 3, Tier 4 and movement from pilots and\u2026","Vern Nagel","So, it's interesting the discussions that we are having with many, many customers have expanded quite significantly the interest level, and if you will, technology-based lighting solutions where these things can be that sensory network is really had a frenzy peak there's, there are people that now the lean goes in the marketplace. So we're no longer having to it in July's when we walk into customers with our solutions that we're able to show them if you will very specifically how we're doing these things.","So, the dialog now is how can this help me and so the pilot, the number of pilots are expanding and we are now having folks that are moving from pilot to actual implementation and it's very exciting I mean as we pointed out the number of square foot that we improved in just a quarter it was like a 30 some percent increase we went from 60 to 90 million square feet, 50% improvement so and no one else is anywhere even close to that just to be extremely clear so, we are excited that the growth rates and the acceptance of what is happening and again we're so early in this game that it's, it's very opportunistic for Acuity and our customer sets are responding more and more to it and I'm really excited about the number of partnerships that our team has expanded with, you'll continue to see us make announcements on these types of partners, which really expands our access to market, but more importantly, it really puts a sense of approval on what we are doing. And it's just not easy, I mean, unfortunately you saw that Equifax had an issue with people hacking; security on our systems and the things that we are doing here are truly industry-leading to be sensitive to these kinds of issues, and that's how we are differentiating -- one of the ways we are differentiating ourselves with our solutions.","Vishal Shah","Great, thank you.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vern Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you everyone for your time this morning, and again, we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the long-term continues to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very, very bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","And with that, we will conclude today's conference. Thank you for participating.

After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you and good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2017 first quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at our website at acuitybrands.com. I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Vern Nagel.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning to everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we'll answer your questions. First, let me say we are pleased with our results for the first quarter of 2017 given market conditions. Net sales were up 16% while diluted earnings per share grew almost 19% both first quarter records. In fact, this was the 15th quarter in a row where we achieved double digit volume growth, remarkable achievement that few companies can claim. We believe these results are yet again strong evidence of our strategies to deliver superior returns to shareholders, provide customers with differentiated value-added solutions and diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding allowing us to expand our leadership position.","We achieved record profits for the first quarter even as we continued to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities for the significant future growth potential, including the aggressive introduction, innovative energy efficient lighting and building management solutions portfolio as well as the expansion of our Internet of Things software platform. I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the first quarter of 2017.","Net sales were up, first quarter record of $851 million, an increase of 16% compared with the year ago period. Reported operating profit was 126.6 million compared with a 112.4 million in the year ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was a $1.86, a first quarter record compared with the $1.57 in the year ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain add backs in order to make our results comparable between periods as Ricky will explain later in the call.","In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2017 was $143.2 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $125.9 million in the year ago period, an increase of 14%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.8%, a decrease of 30 basis points compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2, up 13% from the year ago period. We closed the quarter with $451 million of cash on hand leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our growth strategies. While our results for the quarter were solid improvements over the year ago period despite weak demand in the quarter. We would like to provide you with more color on our results for the quarter.","While net sales grew 16% compared with the year ago period, we estimate that sales value from our legacy business grew by a strong 10%. The addition of Juno increased net sales another nine points while changes in price mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately two points and one point respectively. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to changes in the mix of products sold and to a lesser degree lower pricing on like kind LED luminaires between periods reflecting a decline in certain component cost for these products.","Next point is important, while the increase in net sales was broad based along most product lines and sales channels, we anticipated and planned for a greater growth in the quarter. Demand softened in the back half of the quarter particularly for smaller projects, apparently due to what many of our customers are telling us, the election jitters, and to a much lesser degree delays in certain larger projects due to more pronounced labor shortages at contractors in certain areas. To add a bit more color on this while available market data does not lineup perfectly with our quarters, we've recent information from organizations including U.S. Census Bureau and NIMA which suggests construction put in place for September and October were very sluggish while shipments of lighting fixtures were actually flat to slightly down in the third calendar quarter.","Nonetheless, we were still able to grow our legacy business by 10% far outpacing the growth of the overall lighting industry. While we expect some of these market conditions to carry over into our second quarter, we also expect demand to improve as elections concern subside particularly for smaller projects which generally have short lead times compared with larger projects. I will comment on our expectations for the balance of 2017 later in the call.","Sales of LED products grew robustly this quarter and now account for two thirds of our total net sales which as you know includes the sale of non-fixture related products and solutions as well. Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new more innovated and holistic lighting and building management solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability in a few strategic accomplishments. Our profitability measures for the first quarter were solid but somewhat disappointing for us. Our adjusted first quarter operating profit was a $143.2 million, the third highest in our history while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.8%, down 30 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period.","Adjusted gross profit increased $41.2 million with 13% this quarter over the year ago period primarily due to the increase in net sales, lower component cost and productivity improvements primarily from previously announced streamlining actions. This was partially offset by higher manufacturing cost primarily related to short-term production challenges mostly related to new product introductions and product transfers, a rising quality cost and expected increases in certain hourly employee wages and benefits.","Our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was 42.4%, down a 100 basis points compared with the year ago period, and well below our potential. The decline in our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to less than anticipated variable contribution margin, caused by weaker than expected net sales volume this quarter, and to a lesser degree of the impact of the other items noted above. Another way to say this, as we carried a higher manufacturing cost structure into the quarter in anticipation of servicing a higher level of demand and actually occurred, we are in the process of aligning our supply chain cost structure to meet current demand as well as enhancing the execution of certain new product introductions.","Next, adjusted SD&A expenses were up $23.9 million or 12%. The increase in SD&A expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the inclusion of acquisitions and the continued investment in addition of headcount to support and drive our tired solutions strategy. This was partially offset by a lower incentive compensation expense, as our period-over-period improvement on our key metrics as part of our pay for performance culture resulted in a much lower potential payout than the year ago period.","Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 25.6% in the current quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from the year ago period. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 20% below our current annual target of mid to upper 20s primarily due to the impact of less than anticipated net sales and to a lesser degree, the continued investment and additional headcount to support our Tier 3 and Tier 4 solutions partially offset by less variable incentive compensation expense. All-in all we had a solid quarter given market conditions.","On the strategic front, we continue to make great strives setting the stage for what we believe will be a strong growth and profitability in 2017 and beyond. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls, as well as our building management platform. While the rapid rate of new product introductions is hugely positive for our long-term growth potential, it did put some strain and added cost on our supply chain mostly around component sourcing and production start up issues for those products.","Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio including controls that support building management system and our and IoT software platform, as innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy. Additionally, we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategies which consist of four tier levels. As we have noted before, the purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers lighting, building management and IoT solutions that best meet their needs. These solutions are compelling and powerful value prepositions for customers and true competitive advantage for Acuity.","While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up 40% again this quarter, and now represent more than 12% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things affording Acuity additional recurring revenue streams which we identify as Tier 4 solutions. To fully execute our holistic tiered solution strategy, we have continued to hone our organizational structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers creating the best solutions for our customers applications.","We have added enormous capabilities over the last year including our recent acquisitions, as well as increased salary headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy. In fact, our salaried headcount including acquisitions is up almost 700 associates or over 30% from one year earlier. Few of our competitors, if any have been able to make this kind of investment while delivering upper cortile financial performance like Acuity. At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are actually doing it.","As of the end of the quarter, we have converted almost 40 million square feet of space for customers including leading global retailers and certain other customers to a smart lighting solutions infrastructure. This digital lighting infrastructure is connected to the Acuity IoT software platform which allows our customers to deploy indoor positioning solutions including way finding, asset tracking and geospatial analytics.","As part of their smart lighting platform, we have approximately 700,000 maintenance free LED light enabled beacon that are performing superbly, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful actionable information while providing Acuity with their recurring Q4 revenues stream. Importantly, we expect the installed base of these smart lighting solutions to meaningfully expand by the end of calendar 2017. We believe this level of capability and employment continues to be unmatched in our industry.","Further, we expect that our recent strategic acquisitions coupled with our aggressive internal investments will allow us to continue to deliver and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for future growth that is less reliant on the new non-residential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our now almost 12,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting needs of our customers. I\u2019ll talk more about our future gross strategies and our expectations for the construction markets later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2017. Ricky?","Richard Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid first quarter performance. I will add insight to our financial performance and not repeat the information already provided by Vern.","As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2017 and 2016 which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Primarily, due to the impact of the four acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation expense since we used restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to align the interests of key leaders of acquired businesses with those of the shareholders.","Acquisition related cost including profit at inventory and professional fees, special charges and manufacturing inefficiencies because we streamlined and integrated recent acquisitions and gain on the sale of investment in a non-consolidated affiliate. We believe adjustments for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comp ability and enhance visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.","In addition, many of our peer companies especially as we become more of a technology company make these same adjustments. So, it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. During the first quarter of fiscal 2017, the Company recorded a modest pretax special charge of $1.2 million as we complete the previously announced actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent acquisitions. These streamlining activities included the consolidation of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments.","We realized net savings of approximately $5 million in the first quarter of fiscal year 2017 and expect to achieve annual savings of almost twice the amount of the cumulative special charge or approximately $25 million, and we believe will be at this run rate by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. We are reinvesting these savings in additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy. We anticipate incurring additional cost associated with further integration activities of recent acquisitions later in fiscal year 2017, although the amount and exact timing has not yet been determined.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 35.3% compared with 35% in the first quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to once again be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","Our operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payables at November 30, 2016 increased to 45 days compared with 32 days in the prior year. This increase was due primarily to more stocking of faster moving items to improve delivery service and greater receivables due to timing of shipments. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2017, we spent $19.5 million on capital expenditures, compared with 23.1 million in the prior year. This decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to reduce spending on facility enhancements, as the prior year included expansions in our electronic and panning capacity and the build out of our innovation and technology center and a new production facility.","We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures is fiscal year 2017. At November 30, 2016, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $451.2 million, an increase of $38 million since August 31, 2016. This increase was due primarily the greater net income, lower capital expenditures and proceeds from sale of assets and investments partially offset by increases in working capital and payment of dividends.","Our total debt outstanding was $356 million at November 30, 2016. We had more cash than debt at November 30, 2016. We also had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million under our credit facility which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoyed significant financial strength and flexibility and will continue to see the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you and I\u2019ll now turn back to Vern.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Now, we provided explanations for our first quarter performance, we would like to be very clear on our key assumptions going forward. While we do not give financial guidance, we hope the following will help you better understand our current assumptions. It is reasonably clear that the end markets we serve in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe this quarter moved along at a slower and more in consistent pace than in previous quarters.","Many of our end customers and for this year\u2019s election -- this year\u2019s Presidential Election in the U.S. and certain political events in Europe created uncertainty and volatility over the last several months. We believe this uncertainty and volatility negatively impacted demand particularly for certain smaller projects, which have shortly timed and to a lesser degree residential construction. Additionally, we were told that labor shortages in certain markets cause delays in larger projects. How much all of this directly impacted our shipments this quarter difficult to precisely quantify, but we clearly anticipate a greater shipment in the quarter then actually occurred.","This notwithstanding, we remained bullish regarding the Company\u2019s prospects for continued profitable growth. We believe, the softness and demand, over the last quarter or so was due to temporary circumstances, some of which could potentially linger into second quarter. However, it seems the long-term fundamental drivers of the markets we serve are still positive and intact. Therefore, as we noted in our last 10-K, we still expect to broaden markets that we serve in North America which represents 97% of our total net sales will grow in the mid to upper single digit range in fiscal 2017.","We continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of that markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North America market such as architectural building index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve that varying paces. Forecast from independent third parties continue to project positive growth rates for the residential and non-residential constructions markets in our fiscal 2017.","So, key assumption number one is positive growth for the key markets we serve in our fiscal 2017. Key assumption number 2, excluding the price of certain LED component which are expected to continue to decline and steel costs which have risen recently, we do not anticipate significant changes in other material and component cost over the next 12 months. We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions. Further, we expect employee related cost to continue to rise primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising healthcare cost. Also, we continue to be leery at foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are always unpredictable.","Key assumption number three, while the gross profit margins influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation and price and product and sales channel mix, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve overtime as volume grows and as we realized typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies including cost savings related to recent acquisitions and new product introductions. We continue to target a current variable contribution margin on an incremental dollar sale in the mid to upper 20% range over the course of fiscal 2017, knowing that it is not possible to predict with precision what the rate will be by quarter.","Key assumption number four, our adjusted SDA expenses or percentages of sales was 25.6% this quarter. This is below our recent trend primarily due to much lower incentive compensation expense due to lower year-over-year financial performance improvement. Trust me, we are motivated to drive strong period over period growth which is at the core of our pay for performance culture, which would result in much higher incentive compensation expense. This means, we expect our adjusted SDA expenses or percentage of net sales to be closer to our historical trend, assuming markets rebound, and we continue to meaningfully outpace the growth rates of the markets we serve.","This further assumes, we execute as we have in the past regarding our supply chain performance and are able to move gross margins toward our historical trend. This would suggest that our variable contribution margin over the back half of the year will be higher than our target noted above. So, to be very clear, our key assumptions for additional top line growth driven primarily by stronger market dynamics and better internal execution within our supply chain; lastly and most importantly, to add to the point on the top line growth above, we expect our overall growth rate to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve.","Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform including the expansion of our two and three or four holistic lighting, building management and IoT platform solutions. We continue to experience strong interest from many of our key customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. We have meaningfully expanded number of pilot tests with customers as well as garnered strong interest in new prospects. As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy which has been in place for some time.","This includes expected benefits from our acquisitions of eldoLED, Distech, Geometri and DGLogik, which we believe will allow us to continue to meaningfully expand our addressable market and add significantly greater broad-based holistic solutions allowing customers to optimize the performance of their facilities. As we noted earlier while we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in growth rates for our Tier three and Tier four categories as well as the implementation of our IoT platform solutions. One last point on current market dynamics, the election process in the U.S. has produced a great deal of rhetoric and debate regarding a wide range of policy options with respect to monetary, regulatory tax and trade amongst others that may be pursued by the new administration.","Any policy changes implemented could have a positive or negative consequence on our financial performance depending on how they influence many factors, including business and consumer sentiment. While we are proactively identifying an evaluated potential contingency option under various policy scenarios, we believe it is just too early to speculate which policy options will win the day and how they'll be enacted. We will monitor the situation closely and work with our many points of contact to make sure our government officials understand how certain policies could impact the stakeholders of our company and our industry. As such, it is just too early for us to comment or speculate at this time on the potential ramification of these endless scenarios. We'll comment when it becomes clear.","Our companywide strategy is straight forward, expand and leverage our industry leading product and solutions portfolio, couple with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that'll provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resource, we're investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast changing industry because we see great future opportunities.","Through these investments, we've significantly expanded our addressable market, our strong growth record supports this view. As I've said before we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and more importantly the conversion of the installed base which is enormous in size to more efficient and effective solutions.","We believe this is particularly compelling as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with the merging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe many markets we serve is part of the broader lighting and building management industries, some of which could grow by 50% or more over the next few years, will provide us with significant growth potential. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation we're positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you, and with that, we'll entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","I guess just maybe could you just add a little bit of color, Vern, just on maybe what you are seeing from a quoting perspective that gives you confidence that just some of the slower trends you have seen are more temporary?","Vernon Nagel","If you look at, if we separate our business between larger type projects and smaller type projects, what we saw the follow up in frankly, and it was precipitous was in the smaller projects side of the world. Frankly, it just went flat, and truthfully, if you look at the NIMA data around lighting and we just received this data, just a little while ago for the calendar year of third quarter, the shipment of light fixtures and NIMA participants was actually negative for the third calendar quarter.","We believe that this carried into our, if you'll fourth quarter, and it's just -- it was very-very interesting to us. So, our quote rate was fine until we've kind of got into the middle part of our fourth quarter and the quote rate for those smaller projects went just flat. For larger projects the quote rate continues to be very favorable and you might imagine why, right, because those things have a long lead time. Small projects could be influenced by sentiment very-very quickly. And we heard from a number of different customer constituencies whether it's electrical distributors or whether it's contractors, that the marketplace people were just jittery.","And why were they jittery? It's very difficult for us to say. I believe that we've seen this two years ago, we saw it four years ago and we saw the market rebound. So, I will tell you that the things that we see both in our quote rates not necessarily rebounding yet for the smaller projects but the larger projects continue to be robust but all of the key longer term drivers that drive our business continue to flash positive signs. So while many of you did channel checks it was just interesting to us, we saw something fairly different than that and actually experienced from customer visit, something that was different in that.","So, our view is that while there may be some lingering impact coming into our Q2, because that is essentially December, January; our expectations that the markets will continue to rebound as people get past these things and move back to business. The value prepositions that we have that our available on compelling in terms of paybacks, and so I think businesses are going to get back to business as usual. I also believe that there is a favorable carryover from the election in terms within the business community where I think business leaders are going to be more favorable; so, our expectation is that, we will see this rebound particularly on the smaller project side, and as we continue to introduce new products.","Tim Wojs","Great. That's helpful. Then just on the incremental margins, should we think of maybe fiscal Q1 as being a low point and that variable contribution margin accelerating through the year as volumes come back?","Vernon Nagel","The answer is yes. I mean quite frankly, our first quarter the variable contribution margins were impacted by two things. First, in order of magnitude, just simply the lack of shipments, I mean our expectations were and we our supply chain was ready to deliver against much stronger growth. We're very pleased with the fact that our legacy business grew 10% against the back drop of what arguably was a flat environment. Obviously, we don\u2019t have NIMA data and won't have NIMA data on the fourth calendar quarter until probably what late January would be my guess, but I'm quite certain we're going to see flattish environment.","So, our contribution margin was influence by the lack of volume, sales volume coming through, and then to a lesser degree just some issues that we had within the supply chain different than the issues that we have in the fourth quarter. I mean more because of new product introductions and some product transfers that we just continue to struggle with to absorb those into the facilities where they went. I believe that those are temporary situations will have to address than we are addressing them very aggressively it has been. Our supply chain capabilities have been the hallmark of what we are really good at, so I believe that those two are temporary so they are still I think have some carryover to Q2.","So, an answer to your question, our expectation is that our variable contribution margin will get back to the annual target that we have for 2017 and most likely assuming as I pointed out that the markets particularly over the smaller projects come back and we continue to gain share as we have for a long time, we should enjoy the benefits of that volume and we should see more efficient productions of that products, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation expense as we improve our year-over-year performance and drive greater incentive compensation.","Operator","The next question comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Brian Lee","I guess first off Verne. I wanted to ask on, if you could maybe give us a bit more quantification around some of the temporary disturbances you are talking about. Last quarter you guys pointed to a $25 million pretty precise top-line impact due to the one-time issues. Can you do something similar for this quarter, maybe even Q2? How would you quantify the revenue you missed out on based on some of the election jitters and labor shortage issues you mentioned in your prepared remarks?","Vernon Nagel","So let me separate those let me answer the second one first. The labor issues in Q4 of last year, we believe that we resolve those, we took a number of steps in terms of attracting folks we actually imply to increase some benefits and some wages not materially we absorb those this quarter we anticipated that. So the labor issues we think are behind us the issues that we experience this quarter had more to do with that we carried that labor into the quarter with the anticipation of higher volumes.","You see that our finished goods inventory ticked up. I mean that's primarily because we were producing at a steady rate in anticipation off. We still believe that those orders would come back. I mean precisely when our expectation is just that over the second quarter we should start to see positive trends, what are the indicators that we have it's the longer-term indicators that I pointed to you earlier architectural billing index employment interest rates even interest rates taking up a little bit we're still historically very-very well.","So, all of those things continue to give all third party forecasters, as well as customers that we serve architectural engineers lighting designers confidence that things are there. Our quoting activity on larger projects continues to be very, very positive, and that\u2019s a very positive trend about the overall health of the industry. Projects that are short term in nature, they can move with sentiment, that\u2019s why we comment on that type of thing. And they did. It appears that they moved fairly significantly. We think that we moved beyond that, because the indicators of broad business are favorable.","When we think about the temporary disruptions in the fourth quarter, they\u2019re very different than what we experienced here. Our fourth quarter ended August 31st, some of the NEMA data, which is just interesting to us, again for the calendar year quarter went through September 30th, showing that the markets were flat. I believe, Ricky, there are volume growth in our Q4 was what 13 to 14 points?","Richard Reece","Right.","Vernon Nagel","14, I believe. In this quarter, they were up 10. Well, we\u2019re expecting bigger numbers than that. So where we were influenced is by the short-term stock and flow type projects. When I look at the U.S. senses bureau data around non-residential and residential and look at November on a year-over-year basis, October-September, all these numbers were somewhat weak. Though, November is now starting to show a fairly strong rebound.","So, we\u2019re trying to put all this together. We\u2019re talking to our customers. The enthusiasm amongst our electrical contractors is still very positive, particularly for larger projects. Though, they do have some concern that labor shortages in certain markets will continue to influence just how much business they are able to take on. We don\u2019t know right now what that exactly means.","Longer term, labor, electricians, and people coming into the market, are a critical issue, and may have some impact on the overall growth rate of the industry. But right now, we\u2019re looking at the smaller type projects and how do we get pass that. And again, our view is favorable. Though, it may linger into Q2.","Brian Lee","And then same question just maybe a bit more of a bigger picture one. With LEDs, now two thirds of the mix, I am just curious. How do you guys think about the impacts, the mix shift has on growth potential, particularly in retrofit as some of these products have much longer lifetimes, and will push out the replacement cycle on sockets. And then maybe just related to that, whether the sustainability of the growth you\u2019re seeing in the LED side of the business. How much of that depends on earlier gen LEDs being replaced with some on the newer Tier 3-4 solutions that you\u2019re increasingly emphasizing? Thank you.","Vernon Nagel","So the last portion of your question, first. I would say that the replacement of older LED is probably pretty nascent at this point in time. The board is quite pleased probably with what they have. So, when we think about the overall install base, we still think that the marketplace is $500 billion to $600 billion market, where outdoor is probably 10% or 11%, converted indoor is less than 5%. So, the solution sets that we are bringing into the market place, literally as we speak, whether it's nLight AIR, nLight ECLYPSE, whether it's our sub-metering capabilities, all of these things are new solutions that are directed towards primarily the huge install base.","Where I see on some of these small projects, both new and renovation, we\u2019ve sensed and we believe that people just took a break. I mean they were, for whatever reason, why this happens I don\u2019t know. We think we saw it two years ago. We think we saw it four years ago during the political election process, where people just stopped, larger projects you can't do that, because you put in place a while ago.","So, our expectation is that because of the size of the installed base, because of the solution set, because of the energy savings, which are significant; paybacks are significant and now that you add our IoT software platform on top of that, it's a very compelling value proposition in its totality. So we expect, over the longer term, marketplace to really continue to raise and absorb these types of solution sets. And others will have competing solution sets. And we want that. We want more and more people to be evangelizing proper solution sets.","Unfortunately, right now, there are too many people out there that are saying they\u2019re going to do things, and they really haven't. So, it creates a little bit of a noise out there. But in and of itself that\u2019s not a problem over the longer term.","Richard Reece","And I just want to comment, this is Ricky, I\u2019ll lead it. Brian, we\u2019ve never really participated in the replacements of lamps and ballast in the past. So the fact that LED is last a lot longer, the fixtures in the past, whether they were for S8 or HID or other forms of incandescent, the fixtures lasted a long time is well. So the conversion LED doesn\u2019t have as much of an impact to us on that replacement cycle. The opportunity, as Vern said, is converting that install base to the more energy efficient and better quality of light than LED value proposition where it\u2019s a great play breaking.","The other thing I would say is that, while LED luminaries make-up two-thirds, may be a little bit more of our revenues today. Understand that, we sell a lot of other product, and those products are growing rapidly as well. So, the percentage of what our LED is to what our fixture portion of our business would be probably is significantly higher than the two-thirds. And the other pieces of the business continue to grow nicely, lighting controls as well as building management controls, and now our IoT software platform.","Operator","The next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is open.","Christopher Glynn","I\u2019m interested in the significant headcount expansion last year. And I believe that to be a reflection on how you see the breadth of the Tier 3 projects moving from germination stages into real momentum during fiscal \u201817. Can you update on that overall process and conviction that those investments drive the acceleration in territory in the visibility there?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. First off, as we pointed out in our comments, our Tier 3 solution-set, again grew 40% this quarter over the year ago period. So, that\u2019s very, very robust. And it now represents about 12% of our total business. So, obviously, these solution sets are being received very favorably by the market. And so we continue to see opportunities to invest there. Our software technology group and our IT platform growth now consist of north of 140 people that\u2019s where most of our investment is being going. These are engineering folks of various types.","So when we look at our salary headcount on a year-over-year basis, like I said, we\u2019re up about 700 folks. The bulk of that is through acquisitions, the acquisition of Juno, as well as DGLogik, Geometri, for example. If I look at what we\u2019ve been doing over the last quarter or two, we\u2019ve added at a slower pace. I mean, if I go back to say the May quarter, we\u2019ve added probably in the neighborhood of 30 folks on the salaried side. But if we look at, just picking last May, we go back to last May, we\u2019ve added probably close to 15% on the hourly side. And again, that add was primarily due to expected continued growth. We did get growth. We got 10% growth on our core legacy business. So that was very, very favorable given market conditions. But it was clear that we had anticipated and planned for more.","So, you didn\u2019t ask about the hourly headcount, but I wanted to provide that color. The Tier 3 solution set, we\u2019re very optimistic and we are rolling out, again starting last quarter where we introduced nLight Air, nLight ECLYPSE, those products are now being specified into the marketplace. We\u2019re very excited about those. We\u2019re introducing some new products this quarter that will target the commercial office market in terms of renovation, which is really an untapped market at this point in time. Ricky pointed out early, most of that was being service by people changing out lamps, which we think are very inefficient solution given all of the other opportunities going forward.","So, we\u2019re managing our headcount growth to be very specific. We\u2019re honing it, as Ricky mentioned earlier. We\u2019ve taken some streamlining actions where we\u2019ve invested in areas, so we can continue to investment in these higher growth, higher margin opportunities. We\u2019re very excited about what we\u2019ve been able to accomplish in the quarter on putting in Tier 3\/ Tier 4 solutions sets. As I noted, we\u2019re almost up to 40 million square-feet of these IoT oriented solutions sets, which is really, really robust. And the enthusiasm around that continues to be very, very strong.","And I would also say that, don\u2019t take it lightly that someone has been able to now implement near 40 million take it lightly that someone has been able to now implement near 40 million square-feet of these IoT enabled solutions; the learning curve and the ability to do that is really hard, and we really good at it and getting better at it every day. So this is what gives us optimism about 2017, and the customers that we're engaging, the breadth of customers that we're engaging is increasing at very-very rapid pace. So we're very optimistic about Tier 3 and Tier 4 as we go forward.","Christopher Glynn","And then could you give the current estimates on LED energy savings, or the payback time period, and then also an update on the status of the share repurchase authorization?","Vernon Nagel","Chris, you're only supposed to get two questions, I think you just lit in one more, but anyway. Ricky, why don't you go ahead and talk about share authorization, and I'll take the other one.","Richard Reece","On the share authorization we have 2 million, share authorization the Board has out for quite a while. We've only repurchased a minimal amount as you saw in this quarter under that. So we've got plenty of firepower, or firepower, if that's not the right word, but the buyback shares.","Vernon Nagel","And, Chris, I would say on the paybacks, again, as LED -- prices of LED luminaries, many of you focus on that, that's not really the big issue. It's as we continue to proliferate different capabilities of LED luminaries, in other words a good, better, best solution scenario. As those prices become more interesting to customers, we think that that increases the opportunity for payback. And it depends on cost of energy. As you might imagine, some areas where the cost of energy is $0.20 a KWH, the paybacks are very short. Those areas are also expensive labor areas to actually do the install. But they also have incentives to do that.","So I think that paybacks are continuing to improve. And as a result, I think that customers, again, this is where small projects as well as medium sized projects are very important. Customers are listening to these types of solution sets. They just think that they took a hiatus last quarter because of the jitters that we saw. So, we see paybacks continuing to improve. We see solutions that are not just based on energy paybacks but now have IoT capabilities that are providing even more, if you will, payback opportunities because of value in addition to energy.","Operator","The next question coming from Mr. John Walsh from Vertical Research, your line is open.","John Walsh","So, I had a question, we won't get any numbers around some of the potential policy changes. But just wanted to know if there's additional capacity in any of your U.S. manufacturing facilities, or the ability to add capacity? And then maybe just the idea of what it actually costs to set-up a factory, same policy does go into effect.","Vernon Nagel","So, let me just take a brief stab, and then I'm going to turn it over to Ricky. We have a very strong U.S. manufacturing capability. And the difficulty in all of these scenarios is who knows which one. But what we are thinking through is how we, under different scenarios, would leverage our U.S. capabilities. We are looking, as Ricky pointed out, we're targeting about 2.5% cap of sales CapEx investment this year. Some of that investment may find its way into different locations, if it was probably going to anyway. We like to do a lot of our own painting of our materials as we have moved product around. We have actually had to incur, both expediting of component cost outside processing for painting, just as an example. These are some of the inefficiencies that flowed through this quarter.","So, as we think about our future investments and our future supply chain capabilities, we may actually adjust some of the locations, and just how we may make some of those investments. So instead of putting in a large paint system as we did in Guadalupe, Mexico to support our growth, we actually have been thinking about more micro-paint systems in different areas really to provide much more speed to the market and much more flexibility. So these are the kinds of things that we would consider to help facilitate, whatever changes may occur, so that we can really serve our customers in a much more efficient way. So, while we may have to do certain things, we're optimistic overall about what the positive business trends could be. So, I'm not as nervous about that. We're thinking through those. But Ricky maybe you might want to comment on the rest.","Richard Reece","On the facilities, we do have excess capacity as you might appreciate, with the acquisitions we made that gives us opportunity to consolidate and integrate even though we've done some of that already. We do have excess capacity. We also have ability in distribution centers where we do light assembly, and in some cases do more heavy manufacturing that we can expand at there. And there's opportunity within our supply base to source more of that domestically dependant on how all of the regulations as Vern said, it's just too many options to speculate. Rest assured, we're looking at almost all of those and planning our contingencies around them. And when it becomes clearer, we can provide better clarity.","John Walsh","And then just a quick one here, do you -- can you provide what kind of volume growth you were actually expecting in the quarter?","Vernon Nagel","Well, I believe that some of the consensus forecasts for top line were not outside of our realm of expectation. I think for folks, this is a hint, to look at our growth in finished goods, probably is a reflection of what we were expecting. And now that's at the cost level. And so you can then do your own math from there. I believe that the lack of demand probably was 100 basis points hit on our gross profit margin, not just a guess, in some of the inefficiencies that we had probably added another 50-60 basis points. But that's all speculation at this point in time. We know what our actual results were. We know what we were anticipating. And so we're now aligning our supply chain structure against current demand.","Here's the point that I would make to everybody. Current demand is both what the market is plus what we believe we could grow beyond the market. We have had a long track record of outperforming the market. This quarter was no different. We guess the market was flattish, and yet we were able to grow our core business 10%, as a pretty robust performance relative to the market. So, as you know, we have experienced larger organic growth, volume growth, in previous quarters. So, we were probably more akin to that than what we actually experienced.","Operator","The next question comes from Vishal Shah from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Vishal Shah","Wouldn\u2019t the retrofit market, you guys have introduced some spec cycle products recently. Can you talk about the feedback you're getting from real customers on those products? And also, have you -- can you talk about what Tier 3, Tier 4 segment would look like as a percentage of mix, exiting 2017? Thank you.","Vernon Nagel","So, first off the response from customers and understand that many of these products are spec oriented products, so they go into larger projects. So, the introduction of those products have been the architects, engineers, lighting designers, and the solution sets and the way they have examined and the way they feel about what the features and benefits can be, has been very-very positive. So, it's a spec cycle. These things have to get spec-ed in, and that's how they'll probably ramp-up over the next 120 to 180 days, kind of thing.","Some of the products that we've introduced are also now directed towards what we\u2019d call the more stock and flow that renovation project that's very quick. We were seeing very positive response to that. But yet those things need to translate into orders that then flow through the system. So, our second quarter, we are expecting that we will see the ramp-up of those products and those solution sets, more getting after untapped market as opposed to necessarily displacing other products within our portfolio. So, we're optimistic about what those products will mean for our growth. We've had good demand and good input so far.","We have not specifically provided a target for Tier 3 and Tier 4 solution sets. Other than to say, we expect outsized performance and growth in those things, and we\u2019re seeing that. So we're trying to really get our base established and then to continue to provide you with insight as of the growth in those two segments. Tier 4 revenues improved nicely. But it's off of very-very small base. And relative to our revenues, it's still very small. But yet, it's part of a broader package of solutions that we\u2019re bringing to customers. So we're seeing larger or more significant pilot programs roll-out, we\u2019re seeing a broader base of customers expressing deep interest, and we're expanding that customer base, in terms of our dialogue. So, again, we are very optimistic about what Tier 3 and Tier 4 look like over the next, say 1,000 days, for Acuity.","Operator","The next question comes from Cindy Motz from William Capital. Your line is open.","Cindy Motz","I just wanted to clarify, so the second quarter, you had said in the press release that it was still like a seasonally slow quarter. But just based on some of the new products and what you are mentioning in the ramp. Do you think that you\u2019re still going to see a mid to upper single digit kind of growth in revenues there? And then just specific with the uncertainty surrounding some of the smaller projects with Trump and everything, were they worried about anything like specific, or do you think it was just the overall reaction that, I guess, a lot of us had like uncertainty and then now it's calm down? Thanks.","Vernon Nagel","Cindy, the last question first, because that's one I can answer. It's just interesting to us. I mean, we\u2019re citizens too and we watch all of this, as well as being business people. We saw it two years ago. We saw it four years ago. Why, it makes no sense to us as business people. But yet, we believe that that slowdown was real, and we\u2019ve turned it in many geographies, in many different customer sets. And most are sometimes looking for reasons why that they are going to just delay. I believe that they are going to realize it's guide in \u201912 and they\u2019re going to get back the business as usual and they\u2019re going to look back to hey this is a great investment, a payback that's very short and it provides operating benefits, it provides commercial benefits.","So, it's a bit of a wait and see, large projects continue to move along, the quote rates are positive. We\u2019re seeing positive activity in the precursor of those larger projects, architect, engineers, lighting designers, being busy. The smaller folks or really the smaller contractors; as they go back to their electrical distributor partners and pick-up products and take it to jobs, and then those electrical distributors replenish, that's when we\u2019re going to know the cycle is moving back. Our expectation is that that happens. We\u2019re waiting to see that that happens. Obviously, we\u2019re way early in January. So we\u2019ll wait and see on that.","When it comes to giving a forecast, I just I am reluctant to go there. I will give you by way of anecdotal information. We always -- lesser revenues in Q2 relative to Q1, but in Q1, we always see lesser revenues than the Q3. And yet Q3 and Q1 revenues, Q3 from last year and Q1 revenues this year were the same. What's interesting about that is for us is that typically they would be a little less than Q1. But more importantly the difference in mix between Q3 and Q1 was a significant drop in the C&I world, which is where these small projects are. So we're actually being supportive around that. We continue to believe that we\u2019ll see solid growth in Q2. But also remember that in Q2 we essentially have anniversary all of our acquisitions. So we\u2019ll be back to our real year-over-year growth in terms of real volume, not just acquisition activity.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks. Thank you.","Vernon Nagel","Everyone, thanks for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies, and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will, over the longer term, continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","That concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. All participants may disconnect at this time."],"637":["Acuity Brands, Inc. (Holding Company) (NYSE:AYI) Q2 2016 Earnings Conference Call April  6, 2016 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Vernon Nagel - Chairman, President and CEO","Richard Reece - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Jed Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity","Ryan Merkel - William Blair and Company","Matthew McCall - BB&T Capital Markets","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer and Company","Unidentified Analyst - CLSA","Rich Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Operator","Good morning, and welcome to the Acuity Brands Fiscal 2016 Second Quarter Financial Conference Call. After today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. This conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Vernon Nagel, Chairman, President, and CEO. Sir, you may begin.","Vernon Nagel","Good morning everyone. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2016 second quarter results is Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Dan Smith our SVP, who is usually on the call with us is serving Jury duty this week and probably won't be back until Monday. We are webcasting today\u2019s conference call at our website at www.acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during the call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today\u2019s press release, which will identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements. ","First off our results for the second quarter of 2016 were simply outstanding. There is no other way to describe them. Our net sales grew 26% while our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 53%. We achieved record quarterly results for a number of key financial metrics including net sales, and on an adjusted basis gross profit margin, operating profit, and diluted earnings per share. In fact, this was our 12th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, remarkable achievement. ","We believe these results yet again are strong evidence of strategies to provide customers with differentiated value added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position. These strategies include accretive acquisitions, the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting and building automation solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service, and company-wide productivity gain.","Also in the quarter we completed the acquisitions of Juno and Geometri. These are two great companies with the extraordinarily talented associates that will meaningfully contribute to the growth of our tiered solutions strategy. Our results for the second quarter set records for Acuity even as we continued to invest in our strong sales growth and areas with significant future growth potential. Including the expansion of our solid state luminaire and lighting controls portfolio as well as our building automation and Internet of Things solution. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more details later in the call but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter. ","Net sales for the second quarter were $778 million, an increase of 26% compared with a year ago period, and the highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the second quarter of 2016 was $106.7 million compared with reported operating profit of $78.6 million in the year ago period. There were some minor adjustments in both quarters for a certain special charges which Ricky will describe later in the call. ","Also our reported operating profit included such items as share based compensation expense, costs associated with the acquisition of Juno, the cost of early termination of certain contracts at Juno which were no longer necessary due to the acquisition, and certain purchase accounting adjustments including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangible. ","In order to make our quarter results comparable between periods we find it helpful to adjust both quarter's results by adding back these items. In doing so one can see adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of $127.4 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $85.8 million in the year ago period, an increase of 49%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.4% up 250 basis points from the adjusted margins in the year ago period. ","Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $1.80 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.18 in the year ago period up 53%. This is very compelling performance. We closed the quarter with $224 million of cash on hand after investing $614 million for acquisitions, leading -- for acquisitions this year leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies. Further we generated a $120 million from net cash provided by operations in the first half of 2016 up $44 million from the year ago period. ","Our record results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis. Net sales for the second quarter grew 26% compared with the year ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew by an impressive 17%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 11% or 11 points I should say. While foreign currency fluctuation primarily for the weakening Canadian dollar and changes in price mix each reduced net sales by 1 point. ","While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on like kind LED luminaires between periods reflecting the decline in certain LED component cost and to a lesser degree changes in the mix of products sold. ","The increase in net sales was broad based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products grew over 40% this quarter compared with the year ago period, an extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED based luminaires at Acuity now account for more 55% of our total net sales, which as you know, includes non-fixture related products as well.","We believe our rate growth for LED solutions continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, demonstrating our market leading prowess. Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building automation solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted second quarter operating profit was $127.4 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a second quarter record of 16.4%, up 250 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Again this is very robust performance and historically our lowest quarter due to seasonality. ","Further our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 43.5%, up 200 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvement throughout the supply chain, and lower input cost partially offset by the addition of Juno which in its recent past has had lower gross profit margins than Acuity. ","Next, total selling, distribution, and administrative expenses excluding the adjustment items noted earlier for each quarter were up $41 million or 24%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.1% in the current quarter, a decrease of 50 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to the higher freight and commission cost to support the increase in net sales, the impact of acquisitions, and to a lesser degree higher compensation cost. The increase in compensation cost was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy.","This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our second quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin excluding the impact of acquisitions. On a comparable basis, our variable contribution margin was in mid 30s as a percentage of sales well above our current target of mid to upper 20s. All in all we had another great quarter. ","On a strategic front, we continued to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth from profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continued to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting-control solutions. ","With the addition of Juno we now offer customers more than 1.8 million SKUs to choose from, more than three times as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our Digital Lighting Solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT applications.","We continued to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated, tiered solutions strategy which consists of four tier levels. The purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customer solutions that best meet their needs, whether it would be a single device which we categorize as Tier 1 or a complete holistic integrated building automation and lighting solution, which we refer to as Tier 3 for their innovative or for their indoor and outdoor needs, and everything in between, all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple, both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri, and Juno will meaningfully enhance our industry leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. ","While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category, encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up more than 40% through the first half of this year over the year-ago period. Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional revenue streams which we identify as Tier 4.","To fully execute our holistic tiered solution strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market, and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers\u2019 applications. We\u2019ve added enormous capabilities over the last year including our recent acquisitions as well as increasing our salaried headcount to support the growth as part of our tiered solutions strategy.","Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment, while realizing additional benefits including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.","At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Today, we have converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, utilizing almost 200,000 Beacon enabled lighting fixtures that can collect data and enable applications to provide users with useful, actionable information. People need this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. ","The addition of Geometri will only add to our industry-leading capabilities. The integration of Distech which operates in its historical markets as more of a standalone company is moving along very well. Particularly among the engineering, marketing, and sales teams where we are adding new capabilities to create and market enhanced, unified building and lighting systems as well as expand our access to customers in additional channels. ","We expect the combination of Acuity with its broad industry leading solid state lighting portfolio innovate and control technologies in integrated digital solutions and Distech who contributes to our tiered solutions strategy by offering a holistic, unified solution that delivers true end to end optimization in all aspects of the building. These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment, and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions. As well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.","Through the execution of our tiered solution strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. We expect these recent acquisitions coupled with our aggressive internal investments will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the non-residential construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our 9000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving, and supporting the needs of our customers. ","I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction markets later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2016. Ricky?","Richard Reece","Thank you, Vern and good morning everyone. As Vern noted we had a very strong second quarter performance on virtually all metrics including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will provide a bit more color on our second quarter results and our financial position. As Vernon mentioned earlier we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the second quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be comparable. ","In the second quarter of fiscal 2016, we added back pre-tax $8 million or $0.12 per diluted share for various acquisition related items. Pre-tax $6 million or $0.09 per diluted share for the amortization of acquired intangible assets. $6.6 million or $0.10 per diluted share for share based compensation expense and $0.1 million for special charges related to previously announced streamlining activities. ","We adjusted prior year results for amortization of acquired intangible assets of 2.8 million or $0.04 per diluted share, share based compensation expense of 4.3 million or $0.06 per diluted share, acquisition related fees of $7.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share, and reversal of a special charge of 0.6 million or $0.01 diluted share. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $1.80 for the second quarter of fiscal year 2016 which is a 53% increase compared with a $1.18 adjusted diluted EPS in the year ago period. ","We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you are finding this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. In addition many of our peer companies make these same adjustments so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. ","In our earnings release and Form 10-Q we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 34.2% essentially flat with the 34.4% in the second quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year. ","Cash flow generated from operations for the first half of fiscal year 2016 was an impressive $119.5 million, an increase of $44 million compared with the prior year. We did an excellent job this past quarter of managing operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventory less payable as our working capital -- operating working capital net of the effects of acquisitions decreased by six days compared with last year to 35 days which we believe is industry leading. ","In the first half of fiscal year 2016 we spent $43.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $27 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronic capacity, and the build out of our innovation and technology center in Metro Orlando which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. ","We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenue in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016. At February 29, 2016 we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $224.3 million, a decrease of $532.5 million since August 31, 2015. The decrease was due primarily to cash used upon acquisitions of $613.7 million and capital expenditures of $43.8 million as well as to pay dividends to shareholders of $11.4 million. ","Our total debt outstanding was $353.7 million at February 29, 2016. The ratio of debt net of cash to total capitalization net of cash was 8% at February 29, 2016. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at February 29, 2016 under our credit facility which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility and will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value. Thank you and I will now turn the call back to Vern. ","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction, particularly for Acuity. Our growth expectations for the lighting industry primarily in North America, has not really changed much over the last several quarters, in spite of the noise to the contrary. We remain very positive. So, while we don\u2019t give earnings guidance, I would like to reiterate our observations for fiscal 2016.","First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest, but increasing pace. While forecast for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North America is still expected to grow in the mid to upper single-digit range for our fiscal 2016, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again, the continued favorable trend in our March order rate seems to support this continued level of improvement.","Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American market such as architectural billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability, and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely.","Excluding the price of certain LED components which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input costs over the next 12 months. Further, we expect employee-related cost to continue to rise primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation, and the negative impact of rising healthcare cost. Next, we continue to be wary of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are impossible to predict. ","Another observation, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation and price, product and sales channel mix as well as the current dilutive impact of Juno we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix and as we continue to realize typical gains and manufacturing efficiencies. Our record adjusted gross profit margin for the half of fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential, the positive picture. ","Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, many times we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors, should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly and most importantly, we expect our growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that for example connect smart lighting with smart phones for retailers, as well as our growing electronic and software capabilities. ","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add much greater opportunities to offer our customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities. ","While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for Tier 3, and the implementation of our IoT solutions. Further, we expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels.","As we noted in our last earnings call, while we are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group, we anticipated some modest short-term impact under net sales, as we integrated certain overlapping sales forces. We are pleased to report a large portion of the integration of those sales forces has been completed and early indicators such as quote rates for Juno products are up significantly over the year ago period. This gives us optimism that much of the negative impact of the sales force integration is behind us. Additionally I would know we are ahead of our internal schedule for the integration of Juno which includes unifying our design and engineering teams as well as enhancing our expanded supply chain and streamlining our support activities. ","Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast growing business intelligence company, will enhance our expanding business analytics capabilities as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering and is already paying dividends through greater customer connectivity.","Our company-wide strategy is straight forward, expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We\u2019re investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast changing industry because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market; our growth supports this view.","As I\u2019ve said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by 50% over the next few years will provide us with significant growth potential. As a North American market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Jed Dorsheimer with Canaccord Genuity. Sir, your line is open. ","Jed Dorsheimer","Thanks. Congratulations, spectacular quarter guys. Just two questions from me, I guess first question, I guess the profitability on the Tier 3 and Tier 4 solution sales, has that -- are you seeing a meaningful increase as those bundled or tiered solutions are more readily adopted in the marketplace?","Vernon Nagel","So, Jed as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Tier 3 is really starting to take hold in a positive way but we are still very early in the game. Yes, we are seeing margin improvement but again it is a small contributor to what we are doing today. Obviously we have high expectations that it will be a large contributor as we continue to differentiate those capabilities in the market. From a Tier 4 perspective, we are generating revenues from business analytics and other capabilities within our Tier 4 service offering. But again that is really small compared to the overall corpus. And we are investing in that capability by adding additional software capability, headcount if you will in that area as well as the Geometri acquisition. So, profitability if we looked at it at gross profit level it would be quite high but again off a very small base. So we will be talking about this over the next or forever actually because this will be an integral part of the solutions capability that Acuity will provide its customers going forward. ","Jed Dorsheimer","And then there seems to be a bit of divergence in the marketplace between companies that are taking an approach with low voltage and possibly power over Ethernet as a solution versus others that are taking more holistic controls approach with an integrated package. And I was just curious, you have had -- you are having a lot of success, you have a established distribution channel that seems to support the more of line voltage, I was wondering if you could comment on activities on power over Ethernet or your views of that particular technology and whether or not we should see Acuity with a meaningful product offering in this particular space?","Vernon Nagel","Sure, we believe that a unified solutions set is the preferred choice of most customers. If you go back and look at some of the announcements that have been made by some of our competitors, if I look at what Distech -- they were doing things like that two and three years ago. It is not really new but the capabilities we believe most customers are going to want more full some capabilities particularly as they are trying to optimize how their buildings are not only being used but how they also can collect data off of these unified systems where they work seamlessly and the future functionality of them are much broader and more robust. So early, early, early in the game but our view is that most folks will be opting for a more robust capability because the cost is really not that much different. ","Jed Dorsheimer","Great, thanks and congrats again. ","Vernon Nagel","Thanks, Jed.","Operator","Thank you, our next question is from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. Sir, your line is open. ","Ryan Merkel","Thanks, good morning everyone, and again very nice quarter. So the first question I had was, one of your competitors mentioned that there was some chop and weak conditions in January and February so I\u2019m wondering did you see that as well and you just out-execute it or did you not see it and your view is the market is ticking along just fine?","Vernon Nagel","Not familiar with who made those comments but you know I\u2019ve been with customers pretty aggressively here over the last 90 days as we typically do, and I would say that generally speaking you hear little pockets of softness but I think that those are typically driven by a local geography and potentially a local issue. So if you imagine with the oil patch being soft you might expect in some of those areas where folks are being served that if you\u2019re serving that type of capability sure you\u2019ll see a little bit of softness. But in those markets as we talk to our various customers and talk to our various selling forces, they see opportunities in other areas. ","So I would say that generally speaking while folks were maybe a bit cautious in terms of their outlook, I believe that business activity still continued. Acuity is blessed because not only in the legacy business did we sell through 14 different channels touching the various markets in a very aggressive way, but with the additions of our recent acquisitions including Distech, Geometri they added more capabilities, more channels for us to now touch customers in the way that they want to be touched. So I tend not to get too tied up in what one person or two people or someone says about something because of again the opportunity that Acuity has to continue to touch those markets. ","Our order rate was strong and our shipments were strong as witnessed by our top line volume. And it was broad based throughout virtually all of the various end applications or end markets that we serve. And virtually all of our channels -- for all of our channels and all of our geographies showed growth. So I can't really comment on what others may have said. ","Ryan Merkel","Okay, fair enough and then my second question on incremental margin coming in at 26% I think this quarter, which you pointed out this is a seasonally weak quarter which makes it even more impressive, so I am curious in the back half of the year you know with things seasonally stronger should we expect something in the high 20s or would you just reiterate that we should be in that sort of 25% to 29% range in the second half?","Vernon Nagel","So I believe that the variable contribution margin that you calculated included the acquisitions that had no -- we didn\u2019t pro-forma their results into a prior period. So you\u2019re just seeing what that delta difference, the operating profit off of the incremental sales. But just know that that\u2019s not precisely how we would look at it. So you don\u2019t have that period over period. When we look at the legacy business where we did actually have sales in the year ago period and that this is a same store sales kind of concept, that variable contribution margin came in the mid 30s and again we\u2019ve tried to give guidance where our current target is kind of mid to upper 20s because we are investing in capabilities to really drive our tiered solutions strategy. ","So, you are right, our variable contribution margins were impressive and it had to do with the fact that our gross profit margins improved, our company continues to do an excellent job in driving productivity throughout the organization. So, you really started to see not only improvements in margin through the supply chain and other things that we are doing there but also the leverage on the SD&A. As these acquisitions come into fold and we have year-over-year comparability with them, we still see very positive variable contribution margins. ","So, I still -- we would still like to see folks think about that mid to upper 20s because it is a little bit lumpy in terms of how we are investing in the great talent that we are being able to attract that is helping to drive our growth rates. As I pointed out, our Tier 3 solution set, the growth rates there again off the small base through the first six months were up 40% and those are very telling signs of future opportunities. ","Ryan Merkel","Very good, thank you. ","Vernon Nagel","Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you, our next question is from Matt McCall with BB&T Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open. ","Matthew McCall","Thank you, good morning guys. So, maybe I want to just expand on the last one, Vernon, in the past you have given us some good insight into the way you see the SD&A line broken out kind of fixed and variable. I guess the question is, is there -- two parts of the question is are there are any shift or can you give us any update on the fixed variable components of that line item post these acquisitions and then as we see it sounds like mix is going to be your friend as we see mix continue to benefit your overall margin if your contribution margin remains in the mid to upper 20s, does that imply that you can actually have -- you actually have more to invest as you generate high levels of profits, hopefully that makes sense?","Richard Reece","It does. Our expectation as we continued to expand our offerings in tiers 3 and 4 which we expect will deliver higher gross profit margins but also as we continue to develop and hone our capabilities with the legacy Acuity, Distech if you know. In tiers 1 and 2 we see that as also being a very powerful driver over the next 12 to 18 months. They obviously for different reasons expand our access to market but also expand our capabilities in those various end markets that are growing. If you look at residential for the last couple of quarters, last several quarters actually residential continues to grow in sort of that low teens area. And Juno combined with our Lithonia and other brand gives us a pretty robust offering there. So we are pretty excited about that. ","If we think about Distech and what it is doing, it has very strong gross profit margin. So we want to continue to invest and we are investing to expand the portfolio that Distech and Acuity can offer in terms of an unified system. But that would be a Tier 3 and we believe that, that overall system from a building management perspective gives building owners the opportunity to really drive Internet of Things which will allow us to develop a recurring revenue stream in the Tier 4 area for us. So, the answer is yes, we would expect our variable contribution margins to expand over time but right now we are in a bit of an investing mode. If you look at our salaried headcount it has increased so it is a bit difficult to precisely answer your question around the fixed variable piece. We prefer to target more as a percentage of sales if you saw us leverage this quarter. Our SD&A, we picked up about 50 basis points so that was really helpful. ","It is interesting as we manage our business, and I think our team is doing that very, very well. If you look at our salary and our wages as a percentage of our total revenues, it continues to show productivity there. So these investments are paying off and giving us more capability to drive more variable contribution margin as we differentiate our solution set. So, I think the way we would ask folks to look at our SD&A is more as percentage of sales and then hone in based on the last couple of questions, hone in on the variable contribution margin as we go forward. And I think that, that picture will allow folks to test their models, create their models, and measure our ability to execute against those in a very favorable way.","Matthew McCall","Okay, alright and just one follow up. There is a long cash flow, the last couple of years it has been about 200 million annually that you have increased cash on a balance sheet and you made some acquisitions this year. Just want to maybe give us any insight into what may change in the cash flow drivers post the acquisitions and specifically I noticed payable has actually ticked down as a percentage of sales in Q2, normally that goes up, was that acquisition related, is something changing with the seasonality, just any more color will be helpful?","Vernon Nagel","So Ricky if you could address that.","Richard Reece","Yes, sure. Matt, you\u2019re right the acquisitions, primarily the acquisition of Juno. Juno historically does have more operating working capital then we traditionally have as a percentage of revenue, our returns the way you look at it and its really pretty much all three of the components or a bit opportunistic for us. Their receivable days are higher, their inventory is quite a bit higher, and their payable days are shorter. So we do see opportunity as we continue to work with them and look at ways to integrate their back office functions as well as some of the transactional areas to improve on that. ","So I do think you are going to continue to see us generating strong cash flow. The opportunity for the legacy business I think is still there on inventory, I feel pretty good where we are in receivable and payable days. They are the industry leading we believe not necessarily work class, there are still opportunity for improvement but certainly industry leading in our industry. But we still see some opportunities to continue to work through working capital. ","The other variable beyond operating working capital is CAPEX. You have seen a bit of a tick up in the last couple of years as we needed to expand our footprint if you will on office space for engineers primarily as well as a little bit in manufacturing or expanding some manufacturing capability as well. But I now also see some opportunity with the acquisitions to see how we can better get efficiencies out of that. So CAPEX at the 2.5% I think is a good number for now. That\u2019s a little higher than we\u2019ve historically run but I do see strong cash flow going forward as we continue to see opportunities to manage working capital particularly with the acquired businesses as well as inventory. ","Vernon Nagel","If I could just pile on a little bit, our team has done just an outstanding job through the first half of generating cash flow from operations. I mean if you look at $120 million up $44 million over the year ago period and yet we paid out in the first quarter probably an extra $20 million of bonus over the year ago period. So when you think about that, that cash flow performance is very robust. And as Ricky points out, this year is probably -- last year and this year we\u2019ve spent a little bit more as a percentage of sales than we typically have. My guess is that as we look out into 2017 and 2018 that number starts to come back to a little bit more closer to our historical number. But again as we pointed out earlier, Acuity is really a human capital business and so adding the kind of skill sets and capabilities that are required to really drive our total solution set is what we\u2019re doing. And what we\u2019re seeing from a return off of those investments, pretty robust. ","Matthew McCall","Okay, thank you guys. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is open. You may proceed. ","Christopher Glynn","Thank you, good morning. Wanted to talk a little bit about the core volume acceleration from the first quarter to the second quarter and last year you noted some headwinds from weather reports, it wasn\u2019t really evident in headline number but it was called out a little bit. I am wondering if the acceleration of 17% here reflected some benign weather or is that more kind of the building of the core base of Tier 3 into the run rates?","Richard Reece","If we look at the legacy business it was down slightly this quarter compared to the first quarter but nowhere near what the historical change has been. Look I -- the only way we are able to determine market share is through the [indiscernible] data. We only see ours compared to the total pie. We know we are continuing to drive share but I believe that, that the bulk of that share gain well it is impossible to say precisely where it is coming from but I think that the world of renovations for Acuity is a strong contributor and so at times we continue to drive those sorts of things. It is very favorable. ","The weather conditions this year seemed to be a little bit more mild compared to the year ago period so potentially there is something there. When we look at our utility business, it is a outdoor business. We continued to have strong traction but we have had strong traction period over period, sequential or year-over-year growth in those areas. So, I just feel like our sales forces were executing well. Maybe weather gave us a little bit of a break but we expect to continue to build on that Tier 3 solutions. ","Again for the bulk of what we have those are indoor activities and so I don\u2019t know if those would have been -- getting solid but nice growth there but it is off a pretty small base. So, it is hard to precisely say why sequentially this year over that or excuse me -- this quarter over the previous quarter. But I do really like what our selling forces are doing and how we are expanding our access and capabilities market. I am certain that, that had a contributing factor to the kinds of performance that we had in this Q2. ","Christopher Glynn","Okay, so if we think in terms of seasonality and run rates would it be fair if we think about the back half take the second quarter and just assume a normal kind of seasonal builds consistent with the patterns?","Vernon Nagel","Yeah, I don\u2019t see any reason why our second half which is traditionally the stronger of the two halves should continue that trend. If you look at what's happened over the last three years, I mean it is 12 quarters in a row now of double-digit growth with a market that has typically grown between mid to upper single-digits, I think we have demonstrated a pretty good track record so far as meaningfully outperforming the growth rates of the markets that we serve. We are excited by the fact that our residential construction came in at very high single-digits. I think it was almost 10% for the last couple of quarters. So, as you know lighting for new construction tends to lag so that new construction opportunity we think is robust and we continue to drive renovation opportunities in our business. So, Chris I would say absolutely that the historical trends nothing that we can see right now that would suggest that those things should be questioned. ","Christopher Glynn","Okay, and then more granular one on the Juno run rates, how is the channel normalization process going. I think you expected a bit of pause in their run rates as you kind of reconciled their business into yours, how do we think about the headline number you have bought it at and what the early stages will be, do you still expect to grow there?","Vernon Nagel","Yes, we do. And so in fact we expect the growth to be robust and positive. What we did is we transitioned their C&I sales force to the Acuity C&I sales force, so that was a huge undertaking for which the Juno associates did just an absolutely marvelous job. And so, we believe that virtually every incidence it was upgraded to their C&I sales force. And so when you do that you have a disruption. When you have a disruption it usually creates problems within the specification cycle which as you all know can be 60 to 180 days. And so, you tend to see a lag and as I said in my prepared remarks we made the conversions very quickly, the teams did an outstanding job that is virtually behind us. And so the court activity that we are now seeing for Juno through the new selling forces in that C&I world are robustly up. And so, we are pretty excited about what that will mean in the future. ","Is it going to translate into a superior growth next quarter, I would say that is probably a bit premature but it will translate into growth both on projects as well as through stock inflow, as well as through various end verticals like residential, corporate accounts. So we\u2019re expecting the Juno team and the Acuity teams to really make hay in their end markets as we combine the businesses. And understand that there was overlap of product. Some of our products will be rebranded Juno and some of Juno\u2019s products will be rebranded into some of the Acuity brands so that we can really optimize how we are selling those products to end customers. That process still is ongoing but as I pointed out earlier we are much further ahead given our own aggressive internal integration plan. So we\u2019re pretty excited with the entire Juno team now being part of the Acuity team means for our customers and our shareholders. ","Christopher Glynn","Well happy hay making, congrats. ","Vernon Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Jamie [ph] of CLSA. Sir, your line is open. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Thanks, good morning. I wanted to ask you about pricing you made some commentary around price mix being 1% headwind in the quarter which seems very consisting with the trends we have seen in the past year or so. I am wondering if you\u2019re seeing any change in terms of the average selling price of your products on the LED side and how that relates to the declining raw material cost?","Richard Reece","Sure, as we pointed out in our prepared remarks we continue to see price mix impact our top line about a point. And we believe while it is impossible to precisely determine the difference between price, product, and channel mix we believe that the majority of that was pricing due to LED luminaires and their prices continuing to come down as component cost come down. And so as you know the math around that, if we are able to maintain our overall profitability and the declining price improves our margin so, our view is that there has been no real change in the trend, there has been no real change in how the competitors out there, it\u2019s a big business from most of what we do. And so we\u2019re competing everyday and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve seen any meaningful change in how our competitors compete. So I would say that it is still kind of more the same at this point. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Okay and when you look at your margin expansion in the quarter, the gross margin level is that price material cost gap significant contributor to the margin expansion you saw in the quarter?","Richard Reece","I would say no. I think that typically it is not a huge amount but I would say where most of our gains have come from have been driven by us continuing to drive productivity throughout our supply chain. Us continuing to focus very aggressively on input cost and to a degree you have sometimes FX that influences that. But I think that overall we continue to manage our overall supply chain well. We\u2019re able to handle the incremental volume without having to meaningfully increase our supply chain spending. So the variable contribution that comes off of that is quite favorable. ","I would say that as we price product into the marketplace that hasn\u2019t materially changed in terms of the trend that you have seen over the last several quarters. We continue to introduce new product and new solutions specs that are similar from Tier 3 which has the influence and the positive influence of maintaining and or improving on our margins. So you are seeing a little bit of that. But again it\u2019s off a small base. So I would say that the predominant reason for margin improvement is our supply chains capability to handle increasing volume without adding a lot of cost or ability to manage our input cost and then to a lesser degree the mix. ","Unidentified Analyst ","Thanks very much. ","Operator","Thank you and the last question is from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. ","Rich Kwas","Hi, good morning. Nice work. I wanted to just Vern ask about the on the margin side as a follow up to Chris' question around later in the year as we move forward with normal seasonality. So mid 30s on incremental for core that would seem to imply that the Juno Distech volumes coming in the mid teens on an incremental margin basis, as we think about the next few quarters, I know there is variability in mix and what not with the legacy business but how should we think about that mid 30s holding and that mid teens incremental for the acquired revenue is getting better, it seems like you are ahead of schedule in some of the integration so seemed like there is some potential that goes higher over the balance of the year but just curious to get your thought?","Vernon Nagel","Sure, you could look at it in two ways. We try to provide insight because we know that whenever you make acquisitions that are meaningful it can distort historical comparisons. So we try to provide with the legacy business what that variable contribution margin looks like and in contrast kind of what you know our target is, our near term target. Ultimately we want our variable contribution margins to be much higher than what they are, right. That\u2019s what we get paid to do, delivering very high variable contribution margin. But we are in an investing mode here in the near-term and have been for a while. So that\u2019s why trying to get people to understand why mid to upper 20s for the legacy business is important. ","When you add the acquisitions there is nothing in the prior period so you\u2019re seeing essentially that P&L down to operating profit flow through as the variable contribution, there is nothing to leverage it. Having said all of that, our feeling is that we will continue to drive the efficiencies, the productivity throughout not only our core business but the acquisitions. It is going to be very difficult as we get into probably the fourth quarter and then into 2017. We won't really talk about what's the legacy business versus the other businesses because Juno will be just part of the whole team. And we\u2019re doing lots of different things as I have mentioned earlier, products that Juno sold under the Juno brand. Probably will fit in other brands better within the current Acuity portfolio or the legacy portfolio and a number of the products that were in the legacy portfolio are going to fit much better under the Juno brand. ","So our ability to sort of track and provide what variable contribution is going to be by the separate entities I think will become clouded. And so we\u2019ll do the best we can in the shorter term. And therefore that pushes you to look at the overall consolidated here is what the sales growth was, here is what the operating profit contribution. I am not trying to break it out by was it Distech, was it Juno, was it Acuity because they are all we are investing heavily to create these Tier 3 solutions that bring all of the capabilities of the acquisitions that we brought together. ","So if you do that this quarter I believe that you\u2019ll see about a 25% variable contribution margin and that's probably a better way to look at it because we will drive productivity improvements throughout the entire business and that includes all of the businesses that we recently acquired and those teams are excited about it. Because they want to take some of that variable contribution and reinvest it back in the business for superior growth. So I like the notion of saying let's look at the whole thing and then therefore as you think about our volume going forward and our abilities to continue to outperform the markets we grow I think it gives you a pretty good opportunity to test your models and test how well we\u2019re performing. ","Rich Kwas","So it sounds like you are pretty comfortable on in all in basis in the mid 20s and maybe there is some potential for upside but it kind of just puts and takes so played out?","Vernon Nagel","And again, Ricky please join in here but we\u2019re looking at very short-term investment opportunities, I am talking about what does it look like over the next 12 months. Where we need capabilities we\u2019re adding that capability because we see longer-term growth potential. The install base of buildings for building management systems, for lighting systems, and to create that unified capability is just huge and people will invest if they can get paybacks around energy and or get more value out of this space, out of the Internet of Things. So we see just on a longer term basis a lot of growth and the variable contribution margins of that growth in the future we think will be meaningfully higher than what we are guiding to in the shorter term. ","Richard Reece","And I would just to pile on a bit, as we continue to build out the solution for capability and then start selling that a fair amount of that not all of it, but a fair amount of that is really software. Once you have developed a software, you have developed the analytics, you have developed the visualization of those analytics to convert it into information that facility managers and customers can now use to make their businesses better. The incremental margins get very attractive. Now we\u2019re building all of those so we\u2019re having a fair amount of investments as we\u2019re calling it in SG&A as we are building out that capability. But once we have more of that in the market place selling and then the repeat sales and the recurring revenue off of it that should be a good driver towards the ability to drive those incremental margins on top of the other items Vern talked about. ","Rich Kwas","Okay, that\u2019s helpful and just a quick follow up on more broadly speaking around on the non res new construction site. You know we were hearing that some projects on the institutional side that had previously been shelved for funding purposes, funding reasons and what not have start to come to fruition, I am just curious in terms of what you\u2019re seeing on the quoting side if you are seeing something similar on the institutional side of your business at this point?","Vernon Nagel","No, overall quote rates continue to be favorable activity. As we pointed out a number of different indicators give us reason for enthusiasm. Again the construction numbers that for a construction put in place for Q1 and Q2 on the non resi side we are in the middle of 9% growth range, that\u2019s very favorable. Resi up 11%, 12%, 13% depending on which quarter you\u2019re looking at, again year-over-year very favorable. So when someone says a project I have put on hold, sure you can pick a project but I think when you look at the broad, broad industry in North America which is what we do, we\u2019re not -- I can't really comment on any given project or a trend because that\u2019s not anything that we\u2019ve seen. We see more favorability in the broad trends than commenting on whether a project or two got put on hold. ","Rich Kwas","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. ","Operator","Thank you. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon Nagel","Everyone thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe we\u2019re focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies, and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the longer term continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright. And thank you for your support. Good bye.","Operator","And that concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect."],"648":["Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call January  9, 2019 10:00 AM ET","Company Participants","Dan Smith - Senior Vice President, Treasurer, Secretary","Vern Nagel - Chairman, President, Chief Executive Officer","Ricky Reece - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Matt McCall - Seaport Global Securities","Jeffrey Sprague - Vertical Research Partners","John Walsh - Credit Suisse","Tim Wojs - Baird","Ryan Merkel - William Blair","Deepa Raghavan - Wells Fargo Securities","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Acuity Brands' fiscal 2019 first quarter financial conference call. After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2019 first quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We are webcasting today's conference call on our website at acuitybrands.com. I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now, let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you Dan. Good morning everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. Our results for the first quarter were solid, despite continuing inflationary cost pressures. We took several actions in the quarter to address these cost issues, including price increases and productivity improvements.","Further, our topline growth this quarter continued our long trend of outperforming the overall growth rates of the markets we serve while diluted earnings per share grew 17% to $1.98, a first quarter record. I know many of you have seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the first quarter of 2019.","Our net sales for the first quarter were a record $933 million, an increase of 11% compared with the year ago period. Reported operating profit was $116.4 million compared with $120.2 million in the year ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.98 compared with $1.70 in the year ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain other addbacks necessary for our results to be comparable between periods as Ricky will explain later in the call.","In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2019 was $134.1 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $135.5 million in the year ago period, a slight decrease of 1%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 14.4%, a decrease of 170 basis points compared with the margin reported in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.32, a first quarter record, up 20% from the year ago period.","Net cash provided by operating activities was a solid $132 million this quarter, while our cash position at the end of the quarter grew to $215 million even after repurchasing $25 million of the company\u2019s stock during the quarter leaving us with plenty of liquidity to execute our growth strategies.","Looking at some specific details for the quarter. Net sales increased almost 11% over the year ago period. Overall net sales volume grew approximately 11%, while price mix of products sold was essentially flat this quarter. Acquisitions, net of divestitures, added about a point to our growth, which was essentially offset by the negative impact of changes in foreign currency and the adoption of the new accounting standard ASC 606.","Our significant growth in net sales this quarter was due in large part because of continued efforts to expand our customer base and the introduction of new products and solutions. We also believe our net sales were favorably impacted somewhat this quarter by customers accelerating orders in advance of the effective dates for announced price increases. Overall, we experienced solid growth in net sales in most channels and geographies as well as most product categories. The largest contributors to the increase in net sales volume were due to greater demand for our Atrius-based luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as our building management solutions created by our Distech team and greater shipments of certain high volume, more basic, lesser featured LED fixtures, primarily for applications on smaller and midsized commercial projects as well as our infrastructure and utility products.","Solutions sold through our independent sales network, which serves the C&I, utility, and building management channels, grew 10% this quarter compared with the year ago period. This network comprises approximately 70% of our total net sales. This growth was impacted somewhat by continued weak demand for larger, nonresidential lighting projects as well as continued product substitution to lower-priced alternatives for certain lighting products.","During the quarter, we announced two price increases to recover higher cost for both component and other input items due to inflation as well as the impact of government tariffs enacted on certain Chinese-sourced finished goods and components. As noted earlier, we believe some of the increase in net sales this quarter was due in part to customers buying products this quarter in advance of the effective dates of the announced price increases. It is impossible to quantify the exact impact this had on our sales growth this quarter. We expect this to have a small dampening effect on our growth rate in the second quarter, historically our lowest net sales quarter in any given year due to seasonality, though again it is impossible to quantify the impact.","As you all know, changes in price mix have been a headwind each quarter for the last few years, so to experience a very slight favorability, call it neutral, this quarter was a welcome change. While it is not possible for us to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in the price and mix of products sold, we estimate the neutral impact of price mix this quarter was primarily due to changes in channel mix mostly offset by both product price and mix, which included substitutions to lower-priced alternatives, primarily for more basic, lesser featured LED luminaires sold in certain channels as well as a modest decline in shipments for larger commercial projects, as noted earlier.","Lastly, while we believe the price increases we put in place will be realized, much of the sales in the first quarter were at pre-increased levels due to both the timing of price increases implemented in various channels as well as shipments of orders at pre-increased prices for previously committed projects as part of the company's backlog. Based on the information from various data collection and forecasting organizations, we believe the overall growth rate in the first quarter, as measured in dollars, for the lighting market in North America was up low-single digits, reflecting continued improvement in demand, reversing the sluggish trend over the last several quarters.","Our net sales growth rate of approximately 11%, even excluding any potential pull forward of sales due to the announced price increases, stands in stark contrast of the overall growth rate of the luminaire market in North America. We believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative, and holistic lighting and building management solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to continue to gain overall share in the North American market this quarter.","Our profitability measures for the first quarter were solid given overall market conditions. They were impacted mostly by significantly higher costs, particularly for certain commodities and components as well as freight and wages which I will address in a moment and to a lesser degree continued product substitution to lower priced alternatives as well as weakness for larger commercial projects.","Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $134 million, down approximately 1% compared with the year-ago period, while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 14.4%, down about 170 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period. The decrease in adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to the decline in adjusted gross profit margin. Adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 39.5%, a decrease of about 200 basis points compared with the year-ago period. It is very important to understand the underlying factors that drove the decline in our margins this quarter and the actions we took to counter those factors as well as the timing of financial impact of those actions.","Adjusted gross profit increased $19 million this quarter over the year ago period, driven primarily by higher sales volumes and productivity improvement, partially offset by higher input costs. Our adjusted gross profit and margin were negatively impacted by higher input costs for certain items including electronic and oil based components, freight and certain other commodity related items, such as steel. Many of these items experienced dramatic increases in price over the last half of our fiscal 2018 due to several economic factors, including new tariffs and wage inflation caused by tight labor market. We estimate the inflationary impact of these items reduced our gross profit this quarter by approximately $16 million and lowered our gross profit margin by approximately 170 basis points.","As noted earlier, we took significant actions this quarter that we believe both help and will continue to help offset these and other cost increases, including wage inflation as well as the impact of currently enacted increases in tariffs. These actions included announced price increases and other measures to improve productivity and reduce costs. We believe that due to the timing of price increases, they had limited positive benefit on our first quarter results. We believe these price increases will begin to offset higher input costs, including recently enacted tariffs in our second quarter and beyond. It is important to note that our adjusted gross profit margin increased 60 basis points on a sequential basis this quarter from the fourth quarter of 2018 on lower revenues primarily due to the improvement in sales channel mix and actions to improve our cost structure.","Next, our adjusted SDA expenses were up approximately $20 million compared with the year ago period. Adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales was 25.2% in the first quarter, a decrease of 20 basis points from the year ago period, demonstrating the leverage of our SDA investment as our net sales volume grows. The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, greater employee related costs and to a lesser degree added expenses recent acquisitions, partially offset by actions taken in prior periods to streamline the organization. Excluding the impact of higher freight and commission expense due to the increase in net sales volume, more than half of the increase in SDA expense compared with the prior periods was due to greater employee related costs. While our salaried headcount remained essentially flat year-over-year even after acquisitions, we expect that employee related costs will continue to rise in fiscal 2019 as markets for certain skills remain tight contributing to a rise in wage inflation.","Our adjusted diluted EPS was a first quarter record of $2.32 compared with $1.94 reported in the year ago period, an increase of 20%. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impact of the new tax law and the lower average shares outstanding due to stock repurchases during the past year, partially offset by a slight decline in operating profit in the quarter. As I noted earlier, we believe the year-over-year increases in certain input costs reduced our gross profit by approximately $16 million in the quarter and obviously negatively impacted our diluted earnings per share.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this past quarter. On the strategic and technology front, we continue to make great strides setting the stage for what we believe will be strong revenue growth and profitability over the long-term. We continue to gain market share in many important product categories and sales channels. Our Tier 3 and 4 solutions were up over 25% this quarter.","From a commercial perspective, we continue to accelerate the number of Atrius-enabled deployments and increased active programs with several of the largest U.S.-based retailers. Our Atrius-based IoT luminaires and solutions are becoming the industry standard in the retail segment. Additionally, we continue to expand these solutions into other channels as awareness by customers grows as they come to recognize the full benefits of these solutions including superior visual comfort and energy savings as well as the capabilities of our IoT solutions, providing them with the opportunity to transform their spaces from nothing more than an expense item into a strategic asset.","As I mentioned in prior earnings calls, it is clear that certain Chinese-based lighting companies, many obviously being subsidized in some form, are influencing pricing for certain basic, lesser featured fixtures sold in certain channels. We will not yield this space for many strategic reasons. As such, we continue to aggressively expand our Contractor Select portfolio to profitably compete in this portion of the market.","Also, as I mentioned, last quarter we introduced nLight 2018, the next generation of our industry-leading lighting control system, nLight Air, a wireless control system with a wide range of options and functionality for which there was strong customer demand this quarter. We believe Acuity has the most comprehensive and feature-rich wired and wireless lighting control systems available in the nonresidential construction market and importantly, they are connected to our growing BMS solutions.","Lastly, we initiated many actions last year to further streamline our operations to reduce costs and improve our productivity. We believe these initiatives both enhanced our performance this quarter and will continue to benefit our operating and financial markets in the future, as well as allow us to accelerate investments in areas with higher growth opportunities. Ricky will have additional comments on this in a moment.","We have been able to create these capabilities while providing industry-leading results because of the dedication and resolve of our many associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customer. I will talk more about our expectations for the balance of 2019 later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you Vern and good morning everyone. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the first quarter of fiscal 2019 and 2018, which we find useful to addback in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for the first quarter of fiscal year 2019 and 2018. Adjusted results exclude the impact of acquisition related items, amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense and special charges for streamlining activities. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2019, we recognized a pretax special charge of $1 million, primarily related to moved cost associated with the previously announced transfer of activities from a planned facility closure. In the first quarter of the prior fiscal year, we recorded a pretax special charge of $200,000. We expect to continue to incur additional costs primarily attributed to early lease termination and moving costs in future periods associated with the closing of certain facilities related to the streamlining actions announced in fiscal year 2018.","Fiscal 2019 first quarter results were impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 606, Revenue From Contracts With Customers, which negatively impacted current period revenues by $2.4 million, gross profit by $1.1 million and operating profit by $1.2 million as compared with the prior-year period. Additionally, fiscal 2018 results were restated to reflect the impact of adopting a new accounting standard regarding retirement benefits which resulted in an increase in operating profit of $1.6 million, with an equal offsetting increase in other expenses resulting in no impact on fiscal 2018 reported net income or EPS.","Please refer to note four and five to our financial statements included in our Form 10-Q filed earlier today for additional details of the impact of the adoption of new accounting standards on both the income statement and balance sheet. As part of adopting ASC 606, you can see in or Form 10-Q filed today that we are providing disaggregated revenues by the major sales channels of one, independent sales network, which include C&I agencies, infrastructure utility agencies, system integrators and showrooms, two, direct sales network, three, retail network, which includes home centers and digital retail, four, corporate accounts and five, all other which is primarily OEM, international and catalog.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was 25.2% compared with 35.5% in the prior-year quarter. The effective income tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2019 was significantly impacted by the provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which was enacted during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. We currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate, before discrete items, will approximate 24% to 26% for fiscal 2019.","We generated $132 million of net cash flow provided by operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2019, compared with $140 million for the year ago period. Operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, decreased $31 million during the first three months of fiscal 2019. This decrease is largely due to reduced to account receivable balance. Our operating working capital days increased 10 days to 60 days, primarily due to higher inventory at November 30, 2018 compared to August 31, 2018. At November 30, 2018, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $215 million, an increase of $86 million since August 31, 2018. This increase was due primarily to cash flow from operations, partially offset by cash used to repurchase common stock to invest in plant and equipment and to pay dividends.","We repurchased 200,000 shares for $25 million during the first quarter of fiscal 2019. In addition, we repurchased an additional 200,000 shares for $24 million since the end of our first quarter. We have 4.8 million shares remaining under our current share repurchase Board authorization.","Our investment in capital expenditures was $14 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2019, an increase of almost $4 million compared with the prior year period. We currently expect to invest approximately 1.5% of net sales in capital expenditures in fiscal 2019.","On June 29, 2018, we entered into a new credit agreement with a syndicate of banks that provides us with a $400 million, five-year unsecured revolving credit facility and a $400 million unsecured delay draw, five-year term loan facility. Our total debt outstanding was $357 million at November 30, 2018. Our debt to capitalization at August 31, 2018 was 16.9% and net debt to capital was 7.5%. We had additional borrowing capacity of $795 million at November 30, 2018 under our new credit and term loan facilities, which do not expire until June 2023. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility to support our growth opportunities, which may include acquisitions and we will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you and I will turn the call back Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you Ricky. While current market conditions in the lighting industry continue to be challenging, we continue to be optimistic regarding our long-term future. We believe our many actions to improve our market reach, enhance our customer solutions and capabilities and to drive company wide productivity will help optimize our financial performance in the future while affording us the opportunity to continue to invest in areas we believe have high growth potential over the long-term.","Our robust sales growth, significant cash flow and upper quartile return on invested capital are reflective of our strong operating performance despite some of these current industry headwinds. Our views on overall market demand for the lighting market and items influencing cost have not really changed over the last quarter. So let me reiterate some of those key items that could influence our performance for the balance of 2019.","Many independent third-party forecast continue to suggest the overall construction market as measured in dollars will grow in the low to mid single-digit range. We still believe the lighting industry will lag the overall growth rate of construction market somewhat primarily due to continued product substitutions to lower priced alternatives for certain products sold through certain channels, though recent industry pricing actions should have a favorable impact on growth as measured in dollars.","Additionally, we expect that labor shortages in certain markets could continue to negatively impact growth rates for both construction and lighting. While the U.S. government delayed the implementation of increased tariffs to 25% from the current 10% for certain imported Chinese-made finished goods until March 1, we believe the outcome of the entire tariff situation could have a dampening effect on overall demand due to higher component cost and finished good prices. Further, it is evident that the global trade issues have certainly created greater volatility in demand in our various end markets and we expect that to continue.","As previously mentioned, we believe the announced price increases and other actions taken will, in time, offset the increases in costs for various items noted earlier. While increases in some input costs such as steel have leveled off for now, we expect other costs and expenses such as imported electrical components and finished goods, freight rate and wages will continue to rise. These potential costs increases --","[AUDIO GAP]","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Matt McCall from Seaport Global Securities, you may go ahead.","Matt McCall","Thanks. Good morning guys. So Vern, maybe start with the comment you made about expanding Contractor Select to profitably compete in that market. Can you talk about just the trends since the reinvigoration or reintroduction of that product, the trends in the profitability in recent quarters and then expectations, just trying to understand what you were referencing when you made that specific comment.","Vern Nagel","Sure. Well, just to further make a comment, I wasn't able to finish the prepared remarks. So there are probably some other important things that I will touch on as we get towards the end of the call. But Matt, let me begin to address your questions.","Yes, Contractor Select was a relaunch of a product portfolio that was directed at, if you will, lesser featured or more value oriented products. And what we did is we had a number of products branded maybe under Lithonia, but we recreated, if you will, Contractor Select to have a more fulsome portfolio directed specifically at that market with new products that had better cost structures for us at better price points. Some of those products continue to be manufactured both in Asia as well as in our North American manufacturing footprint.","So our margins in those have improved and we continue to see growth. Contractor Select is designed to serve both the home center channel as well as the electrical distribution channel, and then to a lesser degree showrooms and our digital retail capabilities. So we continue to see growth in that portfolio, and it has had some positive impact on our margins. As we said in the quarter, which was really exciting for us, price mix overall was very slightly favorable, let's just call it neutral, which is the first time we have experienced that, geez, Ricky, probably in the last two to three years. So part of that benefit has been due to actions taken like the introduction of Contractor Select.","Matt McCall","Okay. Thank you. And maybe continuing on that thought, you mentioned some of the product comes from Asia, you are manufacturing part of it. I guess I am trying to understand the impact on your gross contribution margin. Do you still get the same leverage opportunities from that sourced product? And will that, I am really thinking about the substitution effect of just the product coming in out of Asia, do you sacrifice some maybe leverage opportunity, but you benefit from lower costs? I am assuming or I am sure, just help me understand the impact and how we should think about gross contribution margin from just pure volume, just given this shift in substitution or trends with substitution?","Vern Nagel","Sure. So as we stated in our 10-K, approximately 20% of our total sales are produced by others. About 15%, Ricky, is produced in Asia?","Ricky Reece","Correct, 15%.","Vern Nagel","I think that was the number. So that's up a little bit from, say, prior years. We obviously have a very strong supply chain in Asia. When you say we lose a little bit of leverage, sure. When you are not manufacturing in your own facilities, increases in volume, you are not able to really leverage that across your fixed cost base, but we like the margin profile of our portfolio in Contractor Select.","And as we think about product substitution, again this quarter, it was essentially a wash, price mix was essentially a wash, which again first time in a long time. So the efforts that we are putting in to products like Contractor Select, not just Contractor Select, allowed us to again have price mix be a wash. I would tell you that product substitution, it will continue. And the way we are attacking that to offset product substitution and what that simply means is that we are moving from a product that has one price point to something that has a lower price point, it's entirely possible that the gross profit margin on the lower price point item is actually higher as a percentage of the sale than on the higher price one, so we continue to push our mix as a company into those areas that we realize both higher profit dollars as well as higher profit margin.","A good example of that is in our controls business, our controls overall business, and it's impossible to call it a separate business because so much of our controls are embedded into our luminaires, but we are seeing great uplift as we continue to introduce new products and solutions such as nLight Air into the marketplace with great demand. So that benefit of that price mix was also because of the introduction of products like that.","Matt McCall","Okay. Very helpful. Thank you Vern.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeffrey Sprague from Vertical Research Partners. You may go ahead, sir.","Jeffrey Sprague","Thank you. Good morning everyone. Two from me, first on substitution. I wonder if you have a sense of how much is happening, kind of at the front end relative to the initial bid versus a response to price cost dynamics in the project later in the construction process and a need to get cost out given other inflationary pressures that may have risen during the project itself? Is there a discernible difference there?","Vern Nagel","Well, let me take a cut at it and then Ricky can take a cut. Product substitution is occurring in two key areas, and just it's interesting, it's trends of how people want to, if you will, use like the shift from certain 2x2, 2x4, 1x4 fixtures to flat panels, for example is a trend that has been in the marketplace for a while. So as Acuity ramps up its capabilities in the flat panel business, and I believe that today we are the largest seller of flat panels in the North American market, at least that's what our data would suggest and that is over the last, call it, less than 18 months that that's occurred. Well, that product is replacing certain other form factors and in those other form factors, we are simply at higher prices, and so that's an example.","Another example is slim form wafers replacing certain types of downlighting. Again profitability off of those products for us, from a margin percentage, is favorable, but yet just pure dollars because the physical construct of that product is meaningfully different than something that it is substituting in certain applications. So it is both upfront but it's also in our stock business, it's also being sold through whether it's electrical distribution channel or whether it's being sold through the home center or the showroom or our digital retail capabilities for, what I will call, renovation projects. It's just people looking at different choices that they have in terms of how they want their space to look and how they want it to operate. And so that product substitution or that shift is having some change on topline, if you will, dollars. Units are obviously up higher, but dollars tend to be lower. And this is again why, to me, it's very exciting for us to show an almost 11% topline growth while all of this is going on.","Jeffrey Sprague","And also just on Tier 3, Tier 4, you continue to seek good growth in units. Can you give us a little update there in terms of actually turning the capabilities on, what's happening there, service revenues associated with it, et cetera?","Vern Nagel","Yes. We are seeing nice growth but often an incredibly small base. And so what we have learned in this process is that people who deploy our Atrius-based luminaires are looking for some level of critical mass within their own facilities or number of facilities. So as they install, they are now beginning to experiment and use. We have certain customers that are much further along than others and they are now actually starting to use apps within their space. We are helping them do that. It obviously creates an increased, if you will, revenue stream for Acuity. But the Tier 4 SaaS revenues are still really small but growing, I mean they are doubling.","So we are very, very excited about the prospects of what that SaaS revenue looks like, particularly as customers start to use the solutions or use the capabilities of the solutions that they purchase. And so as expected, it's now starting to ramp and you are seeing that multiplier effect occur, but again against the $3.8 billion Acuity Brands, it really does not move the needle just yet, but it will. It's moving the needle, by the way, in us selling IoT-enabled luminaires in a very significant way. I mean part of our growth is because of our enterprise solutions capability, which is selling virtually all IoT enabled luminaires and that piece of our business continues to grow nicely.","Jeffrey Sprague","All right. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Walsh from Credit Suisse. You may go ahead, sir.","John Walsh","Hi. Good morning.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","John Walsh","So I am going to apologize because I don't know if I fully understood the answer to Jeff's question, but maybe I can just ask it again in a little different way. As we think about the product substitution, is that when the project first starts, so when the initial bid happens? Or are you seeing the general contractors actually break the spec later in the construction process and then seeing the substitution happening there where you have to go and fight what the contractor is trying to do to the spec? Just trying to understand that dynamic a little bit better.","Vern Nagel","Yes. That's a great question. So generally speaking for projects, products like this are specced in, but the normal cycle just general contracting capabilities that they may spec something else and this has happened historically for years, for decades. You get down to now at the end of the project because lighting is some of the last stuff in, someone may say, listen, I need to alter the specification to a degree, because I am out of budget and I need to be in budget. So some of these products provide great alternatives but their features and benefits are not the same as what may have been specced in. So you can have a combination of both.","But for Acuity, again, if you go back to more traditional lighting, Acuity never participated in the lamp ballast replacement business. Today, we have a product portfolio that is amply suited for replacement of existing luminaires. So when we sell these types of products through certain channels, very often they are for renovation projects, which we have said for a long time is a growth rich opportunity for Acuity or they may be part of smaller projects, where there is not a specification and the builder is saying, hey this product looks like it's a fantastic opportunity or the owner says this is something that I like. Flat panels as a form factor are becoming very popular.","And so again that product substitution is because that product category is growing significantly because people like those form factors. It's simply displacing other types of product that may have had a higher price point and they are willing to any feature or benefit difference, should there be any. So it can be both, but generally speaking, someone is not using that flat panel to break a spec. They are using it as something that they have specified in and Acuity will be introducing a spec-grade product or flat panel family, which is a whole different opportunity. But no, I would say that it's part of the normal course of business and these features and benefits that these products have are attractive at those price points.","John Walsh","Okay. Thank you. And then, just thinking about this potential or the pre-buy impact ahead of the price increase is obviously very difficult to parse that out, but you did say you thought there could be some dampening impact in the next quarter. I mean, is that to think a couple of points? Is that kind of the order of magnitude that you have in your head when you use the word dampening? Or is there a more specific range that you would point us to?","Vern Nagel","Yes. I would say to the extent, because it's impossible for us to precisely quantify it. I would say that to the extent we assume there was some and we have seen some evidence but to quantify that and say okay, here is a number, we just didn't even try because it wouldn't have been worth that effort. But to the extent that there was some, it would have been, generally speaking, a pull primarily from Q2 into Q1. We can't estimate it.","Ricky, any other thoughts on that?","Ricky Reece","No. We have looked at it in a lot of different ways. Some of the pull forward was within the same quarter. So it obviously has no impact on our quarterly result. So it's hard to put a breadbasket around it.","John Walsh","Okay. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from Tim Wojs from Baird. You may go ahead, sir.","Tim Wojs","Hi guys. Good morning.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Tim Wojs","I am just curious if you could give us a little bit of color on just what you are seeing around pricing traction in the marketplace? I know there is a lot of variabilities between price and mix. But if you just look at like-for-like pricing and based on some of the increases that you have put in the market, is there any sort of estimate you could give or what you are seeing in terms of how much of those price increases are starting to stick?","Vern Nagel","Ricky, you want to tackle that and then I will add.","Ricky Reece","Yes. In the quarter, as Vern said in his prepared remarks, very little impact in this first quarter. Most of the price increases were implemented mid-quarter and we protected certain channels as well as the delay due to projects, as Vern mentioned, that were in our backlog. But we are committed to the price increase and do see evidence that in most of the channels it is sticking. It is coming in at different timelines in different channels. But we are continuing to be pretty firm in our resolve with the increases because they were real cost increases, inflationary as well as the tariffs that we are needing to offset and we are holding firm. Most of the major competitors have announced similar if not identical price increases to us. So that is encouraging. But as we always see in price increases, it varies by geography. It will vary by channel somewhat as to how quickly they get implemented and to what extent. But we still are very committed to the announced increases we put out.","Vern Nagel","And Ricky, if I could just pile on a little bit. Two-thirds of our total business is bid business and that hasn't changed. We have experienced real cost increases. We will continue to aggressively look to recover those, both through price increases that we have pronounce as well as productivity improvements. We look at every project and decide whether that's something a piece of business that we are after.","As Ricky pointed out, different channels have different contractual obligations. So we are implementing our price increases, because these cost increases are real to us and we are evaluating as we always do what our product portfolio looks like relative to how we serve and support our customer base relative to how we make money. And so we are aggressively focused on pushing through price.","Generally speaking, the industry is pretty disciplined when cost increases come about putting those into the marketplace and to the extent that those things ebb and flow, again on the bid business we look to optimize our profitability by all measures. So we have seen our price increases we implemented into the marketplace and we are pleased with the progress that we have made so far.","Tim Wojs","Great. And then just thinking about seasonality and just trying to make sure we are all on the same page. The second quarter is typically your weakest revenue quarter. So while I think price would probably have a little bit of a sequential impact, you would also lose some leverage. So is it fair to assume that the gross margin sequentially are down from Q1 just in line with historical seasonality before seeing the more market improvement in the stronger months in your fiscal year?","Vern Nagel","Yes. I would say that the seasonality is normal. We have had this for forever. And you are absolute correct in assuming that the leverage of volume does have an impact. We are looking to recover some of the cost increases that we have increased our price. Again as said earlier, the timing of some of these things are depending on the channel, the contracts that you have with a customer but our expectation is that as we enter into Q2, it will not be materially different than other Q2s as it relates to the seasonality.","While we are optimistic, we are seeing positive signs within the construction market. We continue to see some of the volatility in demand that is caused by people's concerns around tariffs and what's going to happen in trade negotiations. I wish I could tell you differently. We have a positive view of the overall market, but it's still tempered by what happens into a quarter from one quarter to next because someone says, hey, I am going to wait and see what happens with this trade policy.","It's frustrating for us because we believe that there is momentum out there and there is a real need. I look at all of the demographics of rising employment, vacancy rates going down, rental rates going up, absorption of real estate. These are all favorable signs and longer-term bullish signs for nonresidential construction. So it's a bit of a Dr Jekyll and Hyde but overall we are net positive in what we see going forward.","Tim Wojs","Thanks for the comments. Good luck.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel with William Blair. You may go ahead, sir.","Ryan Merkel","Hi. Thanks. Just want to follow-up on the gross margin question. So do you think that you are going to recover the 170 basis points of price cost in the fiscal second quarter? Or it might take a little longer?","Vern Nagel","So, as Ricky and I said, the price increases that have been enacted, some of those take time to roll in because of contractual obligations, because of our backlog. I think we will make good progress in capturing those costs. We don't give guidance on that entirely. I don't want to comment completely on that. But our price increases and our resolve around capturing those price increases are important for us to recover our cost.","Ricky Reece","And then I would just comment, Ryan, that and Vern added in his prepared remarks, we are still seeing inflationary cost increases beyond what are in our first quarter results. So wage inflation is alive and well. Our merit increases went into effect mid or second, last third of our first quarter. So all of that impact will be in our second quarter. So we will continue to have some inflationary cost increases we need to offset, all the reason why these price increases were so necessary.","Ryan Merkel","Got it. So it sounds like you are expect to make progress but we shouldn't expect you can recover the full amount in the fiscal second quarter?","Vern Nagel","We don't give guidance.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. Fair enough. All right. And then back to the issue of pull forward, maybe just comment on the order rates in December? Potentially that could tell us a little bit about what's going on and what the pull forward could be.","Vern Nagel","Yes. We have not seen a meaningful change compared to the prior year in our order rates. Again, my concern is less around the pull forward and more around just how do people release projects, how are people feeling about their businesses. It is becoming more and more evident to us that labor shortages in large markets are having a dampening effect on construction in general and lighting to a lesser degree. So we are looking at the overall demand and why are people doing things. We continue to see strength in smaller and mid size projects, which may not be as impacted by labor shortages of larger projects. So we continue to see this dynamic going on. It gets exacerbated to a degree or the fluctuation\/volatility to a degree into the Q2 weather related things. So we continue to see, what we would call, normal trends. So again, that's why it's impossible for us to say, oh gosh, it's this percent that will impact first quarter versus second quarter.","Ryan Merkel","Got it.","Ricky Reece","I would just like to mention, related to a part of your question, another uncertainty out there is this potentially next round of tariff increases on finished goods coming from China. March 1 is the date the administration said those would become effective, which is obviously the end of our second quarter. Will those go forward? What impact may that have on demand but also on potential pull forward because we have indicated, as others, that we are going to have a price increase contemporaneous with that tariff increase. So that's another uncertainty we are looking at here in the second quarter that could have an impact on order rates depending on whether that tariff increase goes forward or not.","Ryan Merkel","Very helpful guys. I will pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rich Kwas with Wells Fargo Securities.","Deepa Raghavan","Good morning. This is Deepa for Rich Kwas. Hope you are all well. Two quick questions from me. First one is, can you comment on the state of non-res cycle and what you are hearing from the field, especially commercial versus institutional? Large commercial softness, obviously continues. You mentioned that in your product commentary. But do you think that is cycle driven or is that more like a short-term impact from all the headline uncertainty of tariffs, etcetera that we see?","Vern Nagel","So on the non-res piece for small, medium projects, I think that again the portfolio of solutions that Acuity and to a degree, others have to offer, offer favorable energy savings. So good returns on investment. So I think that people continue to move those along typically to the extent that they have access to electricians in their local market. So I see that as being favorable.","Larger projects, all of the big indicators, rental rates, rental vacancies, absorption of real estate, employment, all of those are usually leading indicators of construction, particularly around medium and larger projects. Without getting into the specific verticals of non-residential construction, we still have favorable, but our favorability or our optimism is somewhat tempered by again in some of these key markets the availability of electricians to do some of these projects.","And by the way, what we are talking about here is growth, right. All of these folks have good backlogs. They have projects out there, whether they are the electrical distributor or the electrical contractor. It's just that if their workforce is the limiting factor to their ability to grow and again in the lighting space, we continue to experience a bit of deflation structure for the reasons we have articulated. I think that there should be legs there in terms of what's going to happen in non-residential construction. But we have to solve some of these labor issues.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Can you comment on your residential piece of business? What was your resi growth in the quarter? And have you seen any deceleration or stability in that piece of your business?","Vern Nagel","Yes. So we don't measure it exactly as residential because we sell products that has residential applications and\/or light commercial applications through multiple channels. We would sell those products through the home center channel. We would sell it through the electrical distribution channel. We would sell them through the showroom channel. Those products or those channels, as Ricky pointed out earlier, are network sales for us that represents about 70% of our business, which would have some resi in there.","It was up about 10% on the retail channel, Ricky, which would be also resi and light commercial. We saw favorability there. So we continue to see favorable movements. I know that residential construction has kind of moved sideways here a little bit, but I think that that is just temporary. I mean you look at the number of workers, the population continues to grow, rental rates continue to increase. I am still bullish over the long-term on residential construction capabilities. I think Acuity is well-positioned to play there.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. Final one for me. So just given all the pre-buy due to the price increases, can you comment on the state of inventory in the channel? Should we be concerned at all? You alluded, you talked about some pull forward, but just curious on the inventory in the channel. Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Yes. I don't know that. I am saying that there is inventory in the channel. I think that the channel manages its inventory pretty well, both on residential and non-residential. From our perspective, our inventories are up a bit, because we have extended some of our supply chain to Asia. That's increased a little bit adding a little bit more inventory into the system. But we also continue to grow in certain markets. Take our enterprise solution market, where that business grows, we are required to maintain certain levels of inventory to support store renovation construction. So that's caused us to have to carry a little bit more inventory. But I think that the channel of electrical distribution, the channel of the home center and so on and so forth, all those inventory levels seem to be appropriate given the economic activity that's out there.","Operator","Thank you. And our final question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer. You may go ahead, sir.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Good morning guys. Vern, did I catch that someone out there may be thought you should tighten your prepared comments I guess.","Vern Nagel","Thank you Chris. I think that was you. And by the way, all the questions that folks asked, that was in my prepared remarks.","Christopher Glynn","I am sure. So your volume outgrowth was pretty profound in the second half of last year. I am wondering how to think about those comparison run rates there? In the absence of guidance, how would you advise we consider that? And maybe part of the context is, if you could describe the trend with the building breadth of customers now creating critical Tier 3 mass for themselves pursuant to entering the Tier 4 base?","Vern Nagel","Yes. Our business continues to diversify both in terms of within channels. So if you were to look at the home center business, we continue to diversify our customer base there also looking to evaluate our portfolio in some of those things. So there is a little bit of a ebbing and flowing going on. I love what we are doing in our enterprise solutions capabilities. This is really where we are selling our IoT and Atrius-enabled luminaires into retail and other segments specifically how they are purchased. Well, the acceptance of those products are significant, but the problem and the opportunity is that that's very lumpy. When someone says, hey look, we don't want you in our retail stores from the beginning of November until the middle of January, you could appreciate. That's when they make most of their money in terms a lot of these retailers.","So anyway, I expect our growth to continue to outpace the overall growth rate of the markets that we serve. We have had a good track record of doing that. Some of the influences that we have had here over the last couple of quarters, as we mentioned, we expanded our customer base in certain channels, which caused us to have a bit of, I call it, load-in of certain things. Some of those things will come back to normal volume and activity. So it may not be quite to the level because you don't have those load-ins happening every quarter that we experienced in fourth and first quarter. But again, I think that we have a long track record of outperforming the overall growth rate of the markets that we serve and I think that that's probably a pretty good indicator as you think about your models of how did we grow last year, how do you think the market is going to grow, where you thin Acuity is going to be. I think you can get yourself into a reasonable range around that.","Christopher Glynn","That works. And then just the inventories on the magnitude of a quarter, year-over-year. Just wondered if you can comment on the strategic aspects of that inventory build versus whatever working capital execution factors and the free cash flow conversion outlook for the year?","Vern Nagel","Sure. So we continue to have good cash flow conversion. Our inventory levels, as we bring on whether it be through enterprise solutions or customers in certain other channels, we are working that into our business. But our expectations would be that we would improve our inventory turns as our business processes to support those growing aspects of our business come into both focus as well as we get our processes honed down. Said simply, we have too much inventory right now relative to the service levels. It's just getting those processes honed between ourselves and the customers, their POS, their store increases, some of the projects that we have worked on within our utility channel. Our utility business continues to grow significantly well. There are requirements for inventory until we get that pipeline really smoothed out. We have added inventory to support the service levels. So our expectation as a company is really critical to us to get our inventory turns back to where it should be with levels of service that are commensurate with customers' expectations. So I believe that by the end of year you will see our inventory turns and our inventory levels improve relative to the volume.","Ricky Reece","It's days on hand that's important and it's service that's important, not the dollars that are important. So we want to get those metrics back to where we think we ought to be out there.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. Have a good one.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","So thank you so much. You asked some of my remarks were cut off of it a bit, but I think we answered some of the things I would have said during the Q&A. So again, I would like to thank you for your time this morning and again we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that have the potential over the longer term to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may go ahead and disconnect at this time."],"652":["Acuity Brands, Inc.

[Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to introduce Mr. Pete Shannin, Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development. Sir, you may begin.","Pete Shannin","Good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2020 first quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen Holcom, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at acuitybrands.com. During this call, we will also discuss certain non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations to comparable GAAP financial measures can be found in our first quarter press release.","I would like to remind everyone that during the call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risk and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Further, forward-looking statements speak only as to the date that they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of these statements in light of new information and future events. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections on forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Pete. Good morning, everyone. We have a great deal to discuss this morning, including our CEO succession plan, which I will address later in the call. But first, Karen and I would like to make a few comments regarding the quarter, and then after we will answer your questions. As you will recall from our last earnings call, we expected our net sales to be down this quarter compared with the year ago period, primarily due to the significant pull forward of orders last year as customers placed orders in advance of two announced price increases, and to a lesser degree, the impact of our efforts to improve the margin profile of our product portfolio. While the precise impact of this pull forward in the year ago period was impossible to determine, we felt it was probable our net sales would decline this quarter by mid- to upper single digit from last year. This decline played out pretty much as we expected. However, we believe the decline in our net sales this quarter was also exacerbated by additional weakness in the overall demand primarily due to continued concerns over global trade and the economic issues.","Nonetheless, our results for the first quarter were solid despite these issues as witnessed by our enhanced gross profit margin profile and strong cash flow from operations. In addition, we took several actions in the quarter to better align the resources of our company to current demand and to further invest in our key strategies to drive profitable growth in the future. Some of these actions resulted in a special charge this quarter, which we will further discuss later in the call.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Karen will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the first quarter of 2020.","Net sales for the first quarter were $835 million, a decrease of 10.5% compared with the year ago period. Reported operating profit was $83.6 million compared with $116.4 million in the year ago period.","Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.44 compared with $1.98 in the year ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items as well as certain other add backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods as Karen will explain later in the call. ","In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2020 was $119 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $134.1 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin was 14.3%, a slight decrease of 10 basis points compared with the margin reported in the prior year, even with net sales down 10.5% from the year ago period.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $2.13 compared with $2.32 earned in the year ago period, a decline of 8%. Net cash provided by operating activities was a solid $130 million this quarter, while our cash position at the end of the quarter was $267 million even after investing over $300 million for strategic acquisitions and investments made during the quarter, leaving us with plenty of liquidity to execute our growth strategies. ","Looking at some specific details for the quarter. Net sales decreased 10.5% from the year ago period. Overall, net sales volume declined approximately 16%. While the price\/mix of products sold was favorable this quarter by approximately 3%, we estimate price\/mix was impacted by a favorable shift in channel mix and to a lesser extent, realization from price increases implemented in fiscal 2019 partially offset by unfavorable mix of products sold.","The positive change in sales channel mix was mostly influenced by the decline in net sales of lower-margin products sold primarily through the retail channel partially offset by product substitutions to lower-priced alternatives, primarily for basic, lesser-featured LED luminaires sold in certain channels as well as declines in shipments for larger commercial projects, a historical strength of the company. ","Acquisitions added about 2.5% to our growth, while the impact of changes in foreign currency was immaterial this quarter. As I noted earlier, the decline in net sales this quarter compared with the year ago period was due in large part to the significant pull forward of orders last year as customers acted to avoid the impact of 2 announced price increases, one in September to help offset inflationary cost pressures and another in October due to enacted tariff increases and Chinese-made components and finished products.","In addition, we believe demand in the first quarter for private nonresidential construction in general, and more specifically, lighting was weaker than most experts originally forecasted with the lighting market being down year-over-year in the low to mid-single-digit percentage range. We believe these declines were due in large part because of the continued concerns of the global trade and economic issues.","These next few points are important in further explaining the movement in our top line. From a channel perspective, while we experienced declines in most channels, there were 3 key areas of significance. First, net sales through our independent and direct sales networks, which makes up approximately 84% of our total net sales, were up approximately 6% this quarter compared with the year ago period.","Our performance in these 2 networks compared with the year ago period was impacted by the pull forward of orders just noted, continued weak demand, primarily for larger commercial projects where we have particular strength and the completion of certain larger project -- infrastructure projects in the year ago period. The impact of these items was partially offset by implemented price increases, the contribution from acquisitions, market share gains in certain lighting categories, including for certain Lighting Controls and our Contractor Select portfolio as well as growth of our building management solutions platform at Distech, which again performed exceptionally well this quarter. While shipments were down in these key networks, we believe that our performance was reflective of overall market conditions and not specific to Acuity.","Second, lower shipments in the retail channel accounted for about 1\/3 of the total decline in net sales this quarter compared with the year ago period. The decline in this channel was primarily due to the impact of load-ins in the year ago period for a major customer [Technical Difficulty] repeat this year and from the impact of previously announced actions taken by the company to eliminate or significantly reduce shipments of those products whose profitability was most negatively impacted by the additional tariffs.","As we mentioned in previous earnings calls, we expected these efforts to result in lower net sales, primarily in the retail sales channel and more favorable gross profit margins. Lastly, net sales in our corporate accounts channel were down almost $18 million this quarter compared with the year ago period, primarily due to the completion of certain projects in the year ago period that did not repeat this quarter, and to a lesser degree, slower releases for certain renovation projects. ","As we have noted in previous earnings calls, we expect net sales through this channel to be very lumpy based on the nature of the construction cycle of customers serve primarily big-box retailers. Nonetheless, we continue to add to the total square footage covered by our connected lighting and our Atrius-based IoT solutions. I will speak more about our advancements in this channel later in the call.","Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $119 million, down approximately $15 million compared with the year ago period while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 14.3%, down 10 basis points from the year ago period. Furthermore, there are some additional points for you to consider as you evaluate our financial performance this quarter.","First, our gross -- our adjusted gross profit margin for the first quarter was 42.8%, an increase of 330 basis points compared with the year ago period, a huge improvement and the highest that we have had in the last 12 quarters despite the decline in net sales volume. Adjusted gross profit was $357 million, down approximately $12 million from the year ago period. The decline in adjusted gross profit was primarily due to the impact of lower net sales as well as higher cost due to the enacted tariffs. These factors were partially offset by favorable price\/mix, lower cost for certain inputs and the contribution from the acquisition of TLG. The really important point here is that our efforts to prune our product portfolio and reduce our channel exposure to those products that do not meet our profit profile and to capture price all had a net positive impact on our adjusted -- our adjusted profit margins this quarter while not unduly impacting our profitability. And to be very clear, this is while growing our value-oriented Contractor Select brand. Further, our adjusted SDA expenses were up approximately $3 million or a little more than 1% compared with the year ago period.","Adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales was 28.5% in the first quarter, an increase of 330 basis points from the year ago period primarily due to the decline in net sales. The increase in adjusted SDA expense measured in dollars was relatively modest on a year-over-year basis, but very significant when measured as a percentage of net sales suggesting our cost structure is too high, given current market demand. ","As a consequence, the company initiated a number of actions to streamline its operations to be more consistent with current market demand to reduce our cost structure and to better allocate resources toward programs with higher profitable growth potential. Karen will provide more details on our special charge later in the call.","Our adjusted diluted earnings per share this quarter was $2.13 compared with $2.32 reported in the year ago period. The decrease was primarily due to lower adjusted pretax income, partially offset by a lower effective tax rate this quarter as well as lower average shares outstanding.","Before I turn the call over to Karen, I would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this past quarter. On the strategic and technology front, we continue to make positive strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be solid growth in revenue and profitability over the longer term. This quarter and in December, we continued our torrid pace of introducing innovative and cost-effective solutions that we believe will drive profitable growth for Acuity over the longer term.","We also continued our pruning efforts to reduce the sale of lower-margin products sold primarily in the retail channel, while we invest to bring innovative and cost-effective solutions to our preferred customers in this important channel.","From a commercial perspective, we continue to experience success in our connected lighting Atrius-enabled solutions. Our products and services enjoy strong market acceptance in retail applications, now deployed in over 5,000 retail stores in North America. We have several large retailers with our Atrius SaaS applications now deployed or in detailed evaluation. Currently, those early technology adopters are now activating Atrius services as part of their customer engagement, customer insight and associate productivity enhancement programs. Increasingly, we see data analytics and data science opportunities generated by our connected lighting Atrius platforms as critical areas of investment, allowing retailers and now others to garner valuable insights about their businesses and facilities from our services.","Additionally, we expanded our connected lighting Atrius-based solutions into other verticals as awareness by these customers of our meaningful points of differentiation and the broad capabilities of our IoT solutions increased significantly, particularly as they realize the opportunity to transform their spaces from expense items to strategic assets. These additional verticals include major airports, light industrial facilities, including warehousing and health care.","Net sales of our Contractor Select portfolio grew again this quarter particularly in the C&I market and now makes up slightly more than 10% of our net sales. Contractor Select is our fighter brand in response to those Chinese-based lighting companies, many of which we believe are clearly being subsidized in some form that are influencing pricing for certain basic, lesser-featured fixtures sold in certain channels. Again, we are very pleased with the growth and profitability of this product portfolio, and we will not yield this portion of the market for many strategic reasons.","We continue to make positive strides in expanding our industry-leading Lighting Control platform and light as well as our building management systems business, Distech, which grew nicely again this quarter. We believe Acuity has the most comprehensive and feature-rich wired and wireless commercial Lighting Control systems available, and importantly, are connected to our growing BMS solutions, providing customers with even greater functionality.","Further, we initiated many actions this quarter to further streamline our operations to reduce cost and improve our productivity. We believe these initiatives will enhance our future operating and financial performance as well as allow us to accelerate investments in areas with higher growth opportunities.","And lastly, we continue our efforts to complement our solutions portfolio with strategic acquisitions and investments, including the acquisitions of The Luminaires Group in mid-September and LocusLabs in November. The Luminaires Group or TLG is a leading provider of specification-grade luminaires for commercial, institutional hospitality, and municipal markets, all of which complements and enhances our architectural lighting platform. LocusLabs is a leading indoor mapping and location platform whose software supports navigation applications used on mobile devices, web browsers or digital displays in airports, event centers, multi-floor buildings and campuses.","The combination of LocusLabs technology with our Atrius IoT platform will provide venues with an enhanced indoor positioning system that can be rapidly deployed and easily maintained, enabling visitor and employee wayfinding, asset tracking and business analytics.","We are pleased to welcome the associates of The Luminaires Group and LocusLabs to the Acuity family. In addition, we made small but important investments in 2 innovative early-stage companies to enhance our lighting control platforms for circadian lighting and smart sensing solutions.","Our solid performance despite continued economic challenges is a result in dedication and resolve of our 12,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our key stakeholders.","I will talk more about our expectations for the fiscal year 2020 later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Karen. Karen?","Karen Holcom","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019, which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release and Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 and 2019. Adjusted results exclude the impact of acquisition-related items, amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, share-based payment expense and special charges for streamlining activities. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we recognized a pretax special charge of $6.9 million in order to streamline the operations to be more in line with current market demand and to allocate resources to activities with higher profitable growth opportunities. These charges consisted primarily of severance cost and lease impairments related to planned facility closures.","Additionally, we recognized relocation cost and lease asset impairment associated with the previously announced transfer of activities from planned facility closures. We expect to continue to incur additional cost in future periods related to current streamlining actions primarily attributed to moving cost associated with the closing of certain facilities. We expect that these actions to streamline our business activities will allow us to reduce spending in certain areas, while permitting continued investment in future growth initiatives, such as new products, expanded market presence and technology and innovation. We expect to achieve pretax savings in fiscal 2020 in excess of the special charge, with most of the benefit occurring in the second half of the fiscal year.","Fiscal 2020 first quarter results were impacted by the adoption of Accounting Standards Codification 842 leases, which requires most leases to be included on the balance sheet.","We adopted ASC 842 using the modified retrospective method and applied the standard to all leases existing as of September 1, 2019. Information for prior years presented has not been restated and continues to reflect the standards in effect for those periods. As of September 1, 2019, we recognized total operating lease liabilities of $64.7 million in our consolidated balance sheet. We additionally adjusted our consolidated balance sheet to derecognize $5.1 million of previously recorded net deferred written balances and reported right-of-use assets of $59.6 million related to our operating leases.","Please refer to Note 4 to our financial statements included in our Form 10-Q filed earlier today for additional details of the impact of the adoption of the new lease accounting standard on the balance sheet.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter of fiscal 2020 was 22.9% compared with 25.2% in the prior year quarter. We currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate before discrete items will approximate 23% for fiscal 2020. We generated $130 million of net cash flow provided by operating activities during the first quarter of fiscal 2020, which was relatively flat compared with $132 million for the year ago period. During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, benefits of the decrease in operating working capital were offset by the lower net income.","At November 30, 2019, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $267 million, a decrease of $194 million since August 31, 2019. The decrease was due primarily to fund acquisitions and investments in plant and equipment and to pay dividends, which is partially offset by the cash flow from operations.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2020, we spent $302 million related to the acquisitions of both The Luminaires Group and LocusLabs. Our total debt outstanding was $356 million at November 30, 2019. Our debt to capitalization at November 30, 2019, was 15.2%, and our net debt to capital was 4.3%. At November 30, 2019, we had $350 million of publicly traded senior unsecured notes outstanding at a 6% interest rate.","On December 16, 2019, the notes matured, and we refinanced with borrowings under our term loan facility. We borrowed the full $400 million available under the term loan facility as the delayed draw mechanism expired at the end of December. These borrowings are currently based on the short-term borrowing rates that are currently approximately half the rate of the public notes. The estimated interest savings associated with the refinancing of the public debt is $7 million to $8 million for the remainder of fiscal 2020, assuming no meaningful change in short-term interest rates.","Currently, we have additional borrowing capacity of approximately $396 million under our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility and term loan mature in June of 2023. Please see Note 19 in our Form 10-Q filed today for more information.","We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility to support our growth opportunities, which may include acquisitions, and we will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you, and I will turn it back to Vern.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Karen. While current market conditions in the overall lighting industry continue to be challenging, we are optimistic regarding our long-term future in that of our markets. We believe our many actions to improve our market reach, enhance our customer solutions and capabilities and drive company-wide productivity will help optimize our financial performance in the future, while affording us the opportunity to continue to invest in areas we believe have high profitable growth potential over the longer term. That notwithstanding, we believe current market demand for lighting will continue to be sluggish and inconsistent so long as concerns over key economic issues, including global trade policies and the potential for future tariffs remain unresolved. We are hopeful that the recent announcements regarding key global trade issues will remove these uncertainties that have negatively impacted the private nonresidential construction markets over the last several quarters.","On a positive note, we are seeing some early indicators, such as the Dodge Momentum Index turning positive for the first time in a while, which could suggest an improvement in the -- in market conditions for lighting in the latter half of calendar 2020.","In addition, we believe there are a few other factors that will continue to influence the lighting market, including continued product substitution to lower-priced alternatives for certain products sold through certain channels, labor shortages in certain markets and continued cost increases, particularly for imported electrical components and finished goods as well as higher freight and wages, though announced streamlining actions as well as a decline in certain input costs should help mitigate some of these factors. As we mentioned in our last earnings call, we are maniacally focused on executing our plans to grow market share, improve our margin profile and to reduce our cost structure to be more consistent with overall market conditions.","As I mentioned on our last earnings call, those action items include continued introduction of new innovative solutions, including the expansion of our Atrius-enabled lighting solutions into the retail and other key verticals as well as the expansion of our Contractor Select portfolio to more aggressively gain share in certain market segments. And lastly, actions to improve our productivity and cost structure.","These growth and margin improvement initiatives are part of our longer-term growth strategy to fulsomely leverage our market leadership position with technology-enabled solutions that are differentiated and valued by customers so we can gain further market share and to appropriately structure our business to the current opportunities to enhance our profitability and cash flow.","Further, the execution of our integrated tiered solutions strategy, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting, building management and our Atrius platform and software solutions and our opportunities to participate in the interconnected world is an integral part of our overall longer-term profitable growth strategy to meaningfully expand our addressable market by adding broad-based holistic solutions that will allow our customers to transform their connected intelligent buildings and campuses from cost centers to strategic assets.","Lastly, our goal is to outperform the growth rates of our key markets and channels we serve. While our strategies include further penetration of the renovation markets particularly for meeting to smaller projects, which continue to experience growth, we are still leveraged to longer cycled, larger commercial projects, which have been most impacted by the global economic issues noted earlier. Additionally, while we expected to participate in the retail sales channels by serving the needs of our customers in a mutually beneficial manner, our efforts to improve our profitability in this important channel could continue to result in lower shipments.","Last evening, we announced that Neil Ashe will become the next President and CEO of Acuity Brands effective January 31. We are extremely excited and pleased to have attracted a leader with Neil's background and long track record of entrepreneurial success to lead our great company as we continue the transformation of Acuity into a global industrial technology company.","Neil is a proven leader whose knowledge and skill in expanding and transforming businesses in rapidly changing markets will enhance and accelerate Acuity's ability to leverage its portfolio of technology and solutions to create great value for our key stakeholders in a globally competitive environment.","By way of background, the Acuity board began the process for senior leadership succession with the promotion of Karen to the role of CFO on September 1. Ricky became President to assist me in running the day-to-day operations of the company, while continuing to develop our very talented leaders. The Board originally anticipated that the search for my successor would be deliberate, open process, not be time-bound beginning sometime in 2020, most likely taking a full year to complete, followed by a normal transition period. As it happened, I was introduced to Neil almost a year ago. We began working with Neil to assist us in exploring new avenues to accelerate the adoption of our technologies, including our Atrius-based IoT solutions. During that process, I introduced Neil to the Acuity Board, first, to consider him as a Board candidate and then more recently, as a CEO candidate.","As I said, our succession plan for me was not time-bound, but when the right person with the right experience and leadership skill is before you, I said to our Board, you should move quickly, and we did. Our succession plan has been designed to ensure that Acuity will provide consistent and lasting stability to our customers and associates in an ever-changing landscape. We have attracted a seasoned leader in Neil with a proven track record of great success in rapidly changing the dynamic environment to lead our great company for years to come. We are confident Neil will build on our robust platform to create even greater value for our customers, associates and shareholders.","On a personal note, I'm extremely proud to have led this great company and its associates for the last 15 years. We accomplished a great deal, transforming the company into a technology leader in our industry while enhancing our market leadership position. I am particularly proud of the 12,000 associates at Acuity, including our senior leadership team. They dealt with economic adversity, including the Great Recession, they had to embrace change to not only survive but to thrive during one of the greatest technology changes any industry has ever witnessed. And along the way, they changed the financial profile of this company into a high margin, high return on capital and robust cash flow generator well beyond many of our industry competitors.","During our time together, we have more than doubled our net sales, tripled our operating margins and created an eightfold increase in shareholder value. Today, we have a great team of associates that embrace change and use it as a competitive advantage as well as a culture of continuous improvement to bring exceptional value to all of our key stakeholders.","We have a tremendous company with great associates, market-leading solutions and a very strong financial profile that will provide Neil and team with a strong platform to drive profitable growth in the future. I am pleased that Neil and the Board have asked me to continue as Executive Chairman, and Ricky as President of our Lighting company and EVP of Acuity to ensure a smooth and effective transition.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of John Walsh with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse.","John Walsh","So I guess looking back in the model, you didn't use to have that much variability around your gross profit margin line within a year, looking kind of quarter-to-quarter. Obviously, very good start beginning of the year. We do expect some volume kind of to come back towards the back end of the year. Should we be able to kind of hold this level around the gross profit margin and go back to that kind of historical pattern where one quarter to another quarter, there wasn't a lot of variability?","Vernon Nagel","So our focus is to obviously continue to drive improvement in our gross profit margin. The benefit has been really from a sales channel perspective, that mix has shifted a little bit. We continue to have very aggressive programs to enhance our cost structure, both from a material perspective as well as a conversion perspective. So this level of gross profitability -- gross margin profile should be relatively consistent as we go forward. Obviously, additional volume rolling through there will also have an incremental benefit on our margin profile. So as we look to the second half, if you will, of our fiscal 2020, our expectation is that the markets should show some improvement. I'm personally excited about some of the rhetoric that we're now hearing about how we might resolve some of these tariff issues. We have our own North American trade discussions that are going on. Hopefully, they'll pass that. The Dodge Momentum Index has started to improve, that's the first time in a while. So many of those things, in my view, are positive indicators of potential. And the notion of having volume becoming a little bit more consistent, particularly for larger projects would have a favorable impact on Acuity's gross profit margin profile.","John Walsh","And then as we've been talking about these streamlining actions, you took some actions here in the quarter. How should we think about what the dollar value opportunity is at Acuity as you kind of take these streamlining actions going forward?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. Karen, maybe you would like to address that?","Karen Holcom","Sure. As I addressed in my comments, we do expect to recover the cost of that streamlining actions and start to see benefit, particularly in the second half of the year. So you will see some improvement with some of that being reinvested back into the business. So do look for improvement, mostly focused in the second half as we recover those costs, but do continue to make investments in the business.","John Walsh","Well, I guess maybe just to clarify the question there. It sounds like there's more to do. I mean should we think of this as kind of a program that we should see quarter after quarter that you'll be able to find some streamlining and get associated payback with that going forward?","Vernon Nagel","So we are -- this is Vern. We are always looking to continuously improve our cost structure, drive productivity and do things, but this particular charge was specifically identified around some key actions. And when you take the charge, you also have to allow for follow-on expense under GAAP accounting. So we identified these actions. We are taking those actions and our expectation is that, okay, let's complete those. In addition to that, we are always looking for ways to improve our cost structure through engineering efforts to reduce material cost, engineering efforts to change our -- how we produce these products, work within our facilities, both our factories as well as our back-office operations to improve our productivity. It's part of our ABS process to look for continuous improvement, but those typical continuous improvement items do not result in what we'll call a special charge.","Operator","Our next question comes from Josh Chan with Baird.","Josh Chan","It was good following the company under your tenure, Vern, and best wishes in your future endeavors.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you so much. It's really been exciting 15...","Josh Chan","Yes, that's right. Yes, maybe we can start off on that. Vern, you were kind of obviously on the Board and asking you for the color on the succession planning. Could you talk a little bit more about kind of specifically what the Board saw in terms of Neil's skill set? And then also, could you also address the timing, at least from an external perspective, the transition looks kind of quick. Why not have Neil join the organization and then become CEO maybe at a designated time later? Can you just kind of go through some of those topics?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. Sure, fabulous. I have been talking with the Board about just normal succession. We often have -- not often, regularly, it's part of our job as a Board to have succession planning discussions. So as we were thinking about both Ricky's plans and opportunities, the development of Karen and other leaders in our business, the timing was right to begin the process. There was no -- as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, there was -- it was not time-bound. We said, let's begin the process. And we were going to start looking really some time in 2020. But as fate would have it, we were introduced to Neil by one of our directors. And he said, Vern, you really need to meet this guy. He's fantastic. He understands business models. He understands the opportunities to transform industries, and with Atrius and the way you all have been transforming your company, bringing in new innovation, looking at new markets, our Atrius IoT capability. So Ricky and I met with Neil almost a year ago, and some of our teammates were involved with Neil in exploring ways to take advantage of what Acuity's platform is about. And so we became quite knowledgeable with Neil. And if you look at Neil's background, he is a serious player, and he has really taken businesses and transformed them.","If you look at where Walmart is today. It was fantastic. The CEO of Walmart came out and said that their stores are their key points of differentiation. If you look at what Neil did is he enabled those capabilities through the development of e-commerce capability. So in every instance, as we've gotten to know Neil, what he has been able to do is transform businesses and make their core businesses even stronger and more robust.","And so I first introduced Neil to some of the other Board members as a potential Board candidate. And again, as Ricky and I got to know Neil more and more, we said this is the real deal. And Neil is a highly, highly sought after executive by many, many large companies.","So what got Neil excited about Acuity is really its platform and its opportunity for great future growth in the marketplaces that we serve and how we may future serve those customers, so it was mutual. And when you have someone with that kind of talent, Neil is 52 years old. I'm not a selfish person. I own a lot of shares. And I said, this is the right thing to do while my own personal time frame could have been something different. When you have this opportunity, you take advantage of it, we did. Neil is the right leader for the future of our business, and I just couldn't be more excited. And I'm pleased that the Board and Neil have asked me to continue as Executive Chair to really help facilitate a smooth transition. Very excited for Ricky to be the President of our Lighting business. He knows it well. The people know him well, and I'm looking for really personally, a solid future growth from this great team.","Josh Chan","That's great. And if I could ask one question on the quarter. I think you mentioned that the market was down in your estimate low to mid-single digits. And it looks like that your independent channel might be down a little bit more than that if you take out the acquisitions. So is there simply quarterly fluctuations or anything to think about there in terms of share?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. So Josh, and for everyone on the call, our expectation, and it was really difficult to know precisely. If you go all the way back to last year's first quarter, we knew a pull forward was happening. It was difficult for us to really get our arms completely wrapped around that. So we guesstimated that it was probably mid- to upper single digits as the influence. My own personal bias based on some analytics is that it was probably in the high single digits that pull forward. So when we looked at our business and you look at the total amount, we also felt that what was happening, and we do have some good analytics around this is that the market this quarter, both the private nonresidential construction market was extremely soft, lighting even further, particularly for larger projects. And then we have noise around some of our stuff. That's why we tried to identify what was happening, if you will, for certain products in our product pruning focus to lessen the sale of products that really don't meet our financial profile. So you had a little bit of noise there.","And then in our corporate accounts world, which is really servicing some of these larger retailers, we've always known that it's going to be a lumpy cycle. It depends on releases, it depends on their own activities. So I feel when we look at our core business, and I made that comment in my prepared remarks that what we saw in those things that were an apple to an apple, the marketplace or Acuity was not overly penalized or not overly advantaged by the market changes right now. So I don't -- the noise around the pull forward and then it being exacerbated by the softness in the market, I think created just a little bit more of a headwind than what we had originally anticipated. Again, just to be clear to everybody, we still think the markets are sluggish and will be until we get some clarity around these things. But I do take some comfort that the Dodge Momentum Index is finally starting to turn positive, which it hasn't for a while.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Sprague with Vertical Research.","Jeffrey Sprague","Just two from me. First, just thinking about the distortions that have been caused by the pull forward and the comps associated with that. Obviously, there's a big cyclical and economic overlay on top of this, but are the normal seasonal factors in play here for your business as we look forward to Q2? Or is there something else we should be thinking about as we kind of jump off this Q1 starting point?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. Seasonal patterns, well, are alive and well. Our Q2 is traditionally the lowest sales number of any of our quarters, we still expect that to happen. And you all know why. It's just because of December, January, February and then construction markets, weather usually impacts those types of things. So we expect that to happen. We hope to get past all of this noise around pull forward here pretty soon. For sure, it will be in the second half that we won't have this noise. There could be still a little bit of noise around that for Q2. And then additionally, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we still are looking at our portfolio and still pruning a little bit, some of these product life cycles and how we position those need to be managed in an appropriate way. So there's probably still a little bit of headwind around that.","Now having said that, we continue to focus on ways to drive and enhance share gain in the marketplace. We mentioned what we're doing around certain types of renovation in smaller and medium-sized capability. So yes, seasonal noise, a little bit of pruning and then expectation around how can we execute to drive some share gain.","Jeffrey Sprague","And could you elaborate a little bit more on projects. I think we all kind of get it, the macro uncertainty just is not helpful, but are you seeing projects kind of taking outright cancellations? Is it a function of things that were in your front log that actually are not moving forward and any particular kind of additional vertical market color on the type of projects?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. So on those larger projects, they're traditionally specification-driven. Our great agent partners are very, very focused on that portion of the marketplace, very skilled at that. And as I travel around the country and talk with both contractor customers as well as electrical distributor customers with our agent partners, their backlogs are robust. But these projects just are slow and have been slow to release. We hear different reasons why. In certain markets, we hear that there are labor shortages for contractors and so -- or for electricians. And so contractors are picking and choosing jobs, they're not necessarily growing larger projects. People are still wondering what's going to happen with costs. So if I wait, we'll have a lower cost potential. So we just keep hearing different anecdotal reasons why people are slowing down. They all seem to make some sense. But here's what we do now. Our agents have strong backlogs that just aren't releasing.","Operator","Our next question comes from Joseph Osha with JMP Securities.","Joseph Osha","Thank you, and again, Vern, let me add my voice to the congratulations on your long tenure.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you.","Joseph Osha","Two questions for you. First, I'm wondering if we might get some comments on future plans as regards to use of cash. Obviously, this year, things skewed a little bit, but I'm curious about the balance going forward between acquisitions, buybacks and whatever else you might do with this very generous free cash flow you're generating?","Vernon Nagel","So obviously, we pointed out that Neil will start January 31. He is working hypothesis around different views of strategy, both for Acuity as well as our core lighting and lighting solutions business, our BMS businesses. So we have a very, very healthy financial profile. And what I'd like to do is defer to Neil when he visits with you on the next earnings call to articulate more of that. One of the things that I believe has attracted Neil to Acuity is not only the culture of our people around driving value for our key stakeholders, but the platform that we have as well as the financial strength to really go after and attack markets by serving customers in a different way. And how he uses the balance sheet to drive this strategy, I really think that he should be the one to articulate that.","I will say on behalf of the Board, Neil's initial thoughts, we are very excited about his vision and what it means for our current 12,000 associates, which I expect that number to grow. So I would just defer to him. We've had a -- he's very focused on capital allocation, very focused on return on invested capital, very focused on growth -- profitable growth. So if you'll allow us to defer to him on that to the next call.","Joseph Osha","And then, I'm going to change my second question then, because that's very interesting, obviously without tipping your hand because you don't know yet. Is it fair to say that as part of this transition, there is kind of a broader review of allocation of capital across different priorities taking place?","Vernon Nagel","Yes. So again, I would say that the Board is quite excited about Neil's vision for the future. And his vision, I think is rooted quite well in his past. I think if you look at the things that he has done in his past, he has transformed different businesses and taking advantage of the opportunities in those markets. What he sees in Acuity in his glimpse into Acuity was pretty significant, when he was working with some of our Atrius folks as well as some of our lighting folks as a real platform. So I think he sees the current, if you will, platform that we have as well as our financial strength to get aftermarkets and customers that are consistent with what we do today, but thinking about how he can transform and change their businesses to become better and more effective using the capabilities that we have and potentially additional capabilities that we will add.","Acuity has been a very aggressive acquirer over the last, I'll call it, 15 years, we've spent over $2 billion, done over 20 acquisitions. So you shouldn't be -- no one should be surprised about a continuation of how do we build our platform and core capabilities. And I think that Neil will continue to do that, but that is a continuation of what we've been doing. So I just am very excited about the platform that he has, the financial strength of the company that he has, coupled with his gifted mind and his really entrepreneurial spirit to do great things for our shareholders.","Operator","Our next question comes from Deepa Raghavan with Wells Fargo Securities.","Deepa Raghavan","Vern, my congratulations to you as well.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you.","Deepa Raghavan","Two quick questions for me. Can you talk generally, not just for the quarter, but how the Contractor Select initiative has been performing within the retail channel, without the -- I mean without the Lowe's load-in? And also, I don't know if I missed it, what was the Tier 3 and 4 sales performance in the quarter?","Vernon Nagel","So let me answer the second one first. Our sales in Tier 3 and Tier 4 combined were significantly better than the decline that we had in others because it was the others that were influenced by the pull forward. So we didn't really provide that data, but Tier 3 and Tier 4 actually -- I don't know that you should take one quarter and compare it, but our total share in that area or that percentage of our business is still favorable. It's probably north of -- well, it's definitely north of 15%. It's probably close to 17% or 18%. So we did fine there. That is also driven by larger projects to a degree. It's also driven by some of the things that we do in the corporate accounts channel. So give us another quarter where we get past all this noise to then bring that back to you, but I just want to say it was favorable. The pull forward impacted Tier 1 and Tier 2 more significantly.","With respect to Contractor Select and what's happening, if you will, in the retail channel. Contractor Select is a portfolio of products that were designed to compete with, if you will, some of the lesser featured, more price-sensitive portion of the market, so limited SKU range, but it's an important element of not only how we serve the retail channel, but it's also an important element in how we serve, if you will, the C&I channel. So we are pleased with the growth rates in that business, even though some of what we're doing in the retail channel with potentially other products is managing that portfolio, if you will, down a little bit. So having said that, I think Contractor Select gives us the opportunity to further leverage and further penetrate both channels, both retail as well as the C&I sold primarily through the electrical distributor. Again, I think we're going to continue to see growth there. What I think you should all take away as a positive is that our gross profit profile continues to improve, even though that portion of the market or our business continues to grow as well.","Deepa Raghavan","Got it. My follow-up is on your portfolio pruning actions. Should we think about that as a low single-digit revenue headwind, not just for the upcoming fiscal Q2, but for the rest of the year as well?","Vernon Nagel","Yes. My view -- and Karen, please chime in here. My view is that some of those pruning efforts should really start to abate as we get kind of through second and maybe a little bit into third quarter. We've done a good job there. And so I would expect that kind of headwind to start to abate.","Karen Holcom","Yes. I think it will be consistent in the second quarter against our [indiscernible].","Deepa Raghavan","Okay. Does it mean all the known headwinds from Lowe's load-in, pruning, et cetera, should all be done with by the time we get into second half. Is that a fair assessment?","Vernon Nagel","It may leak into Q3 a little, but I think that we feel like it should start to tail off. We shouldn't be making big comments around this.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn","Vern, congratulations.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you.","Christopher Glynn","So I just want to go back to the gross margin, maybe try to understand that a little bit better given the magnitude. Also, in particular, it was up sequentially on $100 million lower sales. I mean some of the factors you talked about were more year-over-year driven. So wondering about that sequential resilience given the kind of reflexive thought of how much can change from 1 month to the next, maybe a bunch of higher cost work in progress rolled off. What's going on there?","Vernon Nagel","Well, we have had puts and takes that have been pluses and minuses around these things. The tariffs are still a significant headwind to us. We think that our pricing strategies have countered some of that, countered most all of the tariff. The channel mix issue and including the pruning, if you will, of those lower-margin type products that are mostly impacted by tariffs has had a favorable impact on the mix. So what it's doing, Chris, is it's giving you a reflection into the profitability and the value-add that we bring into those other channels. So you're seeing that uptick. We'd love to have more volume. And so our strategies, our tactical plans are to become focused in certain portions of the market that maybe we haven't traditionally focused on. That represent opportunities for growth for Acuity. So the volume issue is kind of the wildcard, I think, for me, in Q2 I think from material inputs. We're working aggressively to continue to drive cost out of our products through our engineering efforts. We continue to really do well in our factories in terms of driving productivity. Our service is up quite nicely. So we see opportunities to try and grow our business in this challenging market by taking share.","Christopher Glynn","Makes sense. And then similarly, kind of a sequential look at revenue. The seasonality has been more pronounced to the adverse side sequentially the last couple of quarters. Do you think the big mover there has been as tariff resolution gets closer that people holding on to projects and backlog gets more pronounced because they can see a yellow light at the end of the tunnel? Or alternatively, are you -- is there more impact from transitioning from larger enterprise retail Atrius rollouts taking place?","Vernon Nagel","I think that the tariff -- this is just my opinion, so be careful here, I think that the tariffs and these trade discussions create a -- just a degree of uncertainty into the marketplaces. And so I think that people's enthusiasm and their money stay on the sidelines for these larger capital projects. The economy and employment is just fantastic. So you would think that with rising rents and rising in both industrial and commercial, more people working, all of those have traditionally been really positive signals for people coming off the sidelines and investing in real estate. These rising rents look where you live. I mean the cost of rents in that market are going up significantly. Typically, that would mean that people would add capacity into those things, they haven't done that yet. So our view is that, that money comes back. The governing factor around that maybe also some of these labor issues on the trade side. And it's not just electricians, all of the trades, it's a challenge. So even if that money comes back, we're going to have to figure out how to do certain things differently. And Acuity is doing that. We are aggressively looking to change how we service, how we sell, how we do certain things to that customer base, so we can make them more productive. And in turn, they buy more of our solutions.","Christopher Glynn","And what about transitions from previous key supports to the revenue run rate from Atrius rollouts?","Vernon Nagel","On the Atrius rollouts, we are very excited by now our expansion into these other verticals. I would have to tell the world that I think that some of the technology has taken us just a little bit longer to hone and really make it reliable. And I think that we are meaningfully ahead of anyone else in the space. And these customers who are now using these solution sets are starting to say, wow, this can -- this actually can enhance my business model. And so our applied technology team and our sales forces are starting to get into some of these other verticals with these solutions to experiment on how we can add not just quality of light energy savings, but a third element to the value proposition. And that's still going to take time. I think Neil will help accelerate that, by the way, he's a very gifted entrepreneurial. So it will not only make our customers better solution, but it will give our many sales forces more solutions to sell, changing hit rate, changing value proposition and not having to subject all these to just price as the only point of differentiation.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's Q&A. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon Nagel","Everyone, thank you so much, Dan and I were trying to compute, we think this is like the 72nd or 73rd time that you've heard my boring voice. It has been truly a pleasure. Neil and the team will have just a -- it's a great future. I'm so excited about our foundation. So again, thank you for your time this morning. Our future is bright. Thank you.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This concludes the program. You may now disconnect. Everyone, have a great day.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","C. Dan Smith","Thank you. Good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2014 first quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call on our website at www.acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments, and then we will answer your questions. First off, our results for the first quarter of 2014 were just outstanding. Our net sales grew almost 20% this quarter, while our adjusted EPS grew nearly 40%, both first quarter records for Acuity.","In fact, this was the third quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit sales volume growth. We believe this level of growth is, yet again, positive evidence our strategies provide our customers with differentiated value propositions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position in North America.","These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting solutions; expansion in key channels and geographies; and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity. Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter were, again, strong, even as we continued to fund our robust sales growth in areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our lighting solutions portfolio.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later. But I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.","Net sales for the quarter were $575 million, an increase of almost 20% compared with the year-ago period. Reported operating profit for the quarter was $77.4 million compared with $48.2 million in the year-ago period. In the current quarter, we received $5 million as a partial recovery for the fraud perpetrated by a former freight service provider to the company, for which we previously recognized as an expense in the third quarter of 2013.","Also in the year-ago quarter, we incurred certain costs for restructuring actions and inefficiencies associated with a plant closure, which, in total, reduced operating profit by $5.5 million.","I find it helpful to add back these items to both quarters' results to make them comparable. Doing so, one can see that adjusted operating profit for the current quarter was $72.4 million or 12.6% of net sales compared with $53.7 million or 11.2% of net sales for the year-ago period. This represents an increase in adjusted operating profit of 35%, while adjusted operating profit margin improved 140 basis points.","Diluted earnings per share were $1.03. Adjusted EPS for the current quarter was $0.96 compared with $0.69 in the year-ago period, an increase of 39%, very strong results indeed. The results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find them even more impressive upon further analysis.","While net sales grew almost 20% compared with a year ago, we estimate sales volume grew approximately 21% this quarter. While precise market data is not available at this time, we believe this level of sales volume growth was meaningfully higher than the overall markets we serve.","We estimate that the impact of price changes and the mix of products sold reduced net sales by a modest 1%. The impact of acquisitions and foreign currency in net sales was not significant. The growth in net sales was broad-based along virtually all major product lines, while certain specialty fixtures more closely associated with new construction continue to lag the overall average due to tepid environment for new, larger, nonresidential construction projects.","From a sales channel perspective, we continue to experience strong growth in the commercial, industrial and infrastructure channels for both indoor and outdoor applications, as well as continued growth for larger renovation projects.","Sales growth in our largest channel, commercial and industrial, was above this quarter's overall percentage increase primarily due to a continued focus on smaller to medium-size indoor and outdoor projects for both new construction and renovation, as well as continued emphasis on selling higher value-added lighting solutions, especially LED luminaires, which, again, more than doubled compared with the year-ago period.","In fact, each quarter for the last 3 years in a row, sales of LED products at Acuity have more than doubled compared with the year-ago periods. We believe this level of growth is far outpacing the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, further demonstrating our formidable capabilities and product development and our leadership in market access.","Additionally, we enjoyed growth in our residential projects -- or products as demand for new housing and renovation of existing homes continued to rebound. We continue to experience growth in most geographies and sales channels in North America, all of which is very encouraging, though this was offset somewhat by continued weakness in Europe.","Excluding LED luminaires, we believe the puts and takes for product pricing, as well material and component cost, were, again, fairly benign this quarter.","Looking at the overall market conditions for the first quarter, we believe spending in key segments of the U.S. nonresidential construction market in which we participate was up low mid-single digits compared with a year ago, while residential construction was up more than 20%.","Further, as I mentioned earlier, while precise market data for the quarter is not yet available, we believe the overall lighting market grew in the upper mid-single digit range during the quarter, supported by growth in renovation, as well as the residential market. This is in stark contrast compared with our sales volume growth in North America, which was up more than 20%.","Lastly, we believe our sales channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions and the strength of our many sales forces, have allowed us to achieve meaningful sales growth again this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments in the quarter. Excluding the impact of the items I noted earlier, adjusted operating profit margin for the first quarter was a solid 12.6%, up 140 basis points compared with the year-ago period. This is particularly noteworthy given that sales of LED luminaires are now more than 1\/4 of our total net sales.","Further, as Ricky will discuss later in the call, gross profit margin grew 90 basis points to 41.3% from the prior year's adjusted gross profit margin. The margin expansion was primarily due to benefits from higher sales volume, productivity gains and previous restructuring actions, as well as lower costs for certain LED components. This was partially offset by changes in product mix.","As we have noted in previous calls, the mix of products sold and larger renovation projects tend to have a lower gross profit margin profile than our overall average margin. We also continue to experience a higher mix of sales of less-featured, value-oriented products sold through certain sales channels primarily for renovation, which also tend to have a lower-than-average margin profile.","Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses, excluding the benefit of the $5 million recovery noted earlier, were up approximately 17% on the sales increase of 20%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.7% in the current quarter compared with 29.2% in the year-ago period, a decline of 50 basis points. The increase in total SD&A expense was due primarily to higher variable cost for commissions and freight to support the growth in net sales, as well as higher employee-related cost, including incentive compensation, partially offset by benefits from previously implemented restructuring programs.","Incentive compensation expense was higher compared with the year-ago period due to the significant improvement in year-over-year performance this quarter.","We all tend to compare a quarter's results to the same period in the prior year. Usually, our net sales for the first quarter of a given year are less than the previous year's fourth quarter due to the seasonal nature of the nonresidential construction market. Interestingly, our net sales this quarter were down only 1% from the previous fourth quarter. In prior years, the decline on a sequential basis was usually in the 4% to 7% range. Further, if incentive compensation expense have been the same as incurred in the fourth quarter, our operating profit margin this quarter would have been slightly higher than that posted in the fourth quarter. Again, very strong results indeed.","On the strategic front, we continued our rapid pace of introductions of new products, significantly expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions. As I mentioned earlier, our solid-state lighting portfolio continues to expand rapidly, as are the sales of these luminaires. Today, more than 1\/4 of our net sales are from LED luminaires, and we continue to fund the development of holistic lighting solutions for specification applications such as schools, health care facilities, commercial office buildings and various outdoor applications to fully leverage our award-winning portfolio of lighting fixtures, controls and components. More impressively, our adjusted operating profit margin continued to expand, while sales of LED-based solutions continue to be a growing and meaningful portion of our overall business.","As we have noted before, Acuity is a clear leader in digital lighting solutions. It is because we understand lighting and the sophisticated needs of our expansive customer base. We are able to offer customers tailored solutions from industry-leading portfolio regardless of the light source. Our expertise lies in the true understanding of the proper use and control of light while minimizing the use of energy.","We are without equal in the design and development of fixtures and integrated lighting systems for virtually any application without a bias of the light source. This expertise, coupled with a fully integrated, lean supply chain, allows us to produce virtually any type of fixture or lighting control system cost-effectively and efficiently for our customers. This is because we are without the cumbersome and expensive legacy costs and fixed investment needed to produce certain components like lamps, ballasts or LED chips. We source these components through our design specification from the very best suppliers around the globe. This structure allows us to provide customers with superior value while delivering upper-quartile results for our shareholders.","As I've noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during the eras of technology disruption. Today is clearly no different. Acuity Brands is leading the evolution to intelligent lighting solutions with a broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor solid-state and traditional, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls. And we are delivering profitable growth and strong financial returns for our shareholders while making these important investments.","We have been able to produce these robust results because of the dedication resolve of our more than 6,500 associates to deliver superior value to our customers, as well as driving improvements and efficiencies throughout the company to provide superior returns for our shareholders.","I will talk more about our future growth strategies and expectations for the construction market later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2014. Ricky?","Richard K. Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight a few items regarding our income statement, and then we'll discuss our cash flow and financial condition before turning the call back to Vern. Vern covered the primary drivers for our sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items, but I will provide a bit more color on certain aspects of our first quarter results.","As Vern mentioned earlier, our fiscal 2014 first quarter results included an insurance recovery of $5 million pretax, or $0.07 diluted earnings per share, from the fraud perpetrated at a freight service provider to the company. As you may recall, we previously recognized an $8.1 million expense in the third quarter of fiscal 2013 related to the company's loss due to this matter. This payment covers a portion of the loss we suffered, and we continue to seek additional recovery of our loss. If we obtain any further recovery, we will record it when realized. These items are recorded within our selling, distribution and administrative expenses.","Also in the year-ago quarter, we incurred certain costs associated with streamlining actions and inefficiencies associated with a plant closure, which, in total, reduced operating profit by $5.5 million or $0.08 per diluted EPS, with $4.8 million recorded in the cost of goods sold and the remaining $0.7 million recorded as a special charge.","As Vern mentioned, we find it useful to exclude these items from our GAAP results to provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into the company's results, and we have included in our earnings release a full reconciliation of our GAAP amounts to these adjusted results.","Our gross profit margin for our fiscal first quarter was 41.3% and increased 90 basis points compared with the adjusted year-ago period on an almost 20% increase in net sales, due largely to the favorable impact of the increased net sales volume, lower material and component costs primarily related to LED fixtures and benefits from greater manufacturing utilization and improved productivity, partially offset by unfavorable price mix.","Our adjusted operating profit margin increased an impressive 140 basis points to 12.6% compared with the adjusted operating margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit increased by $18.7 million or 35% compared with last year due to the higher gross profit, greater leverage of our operating costs due to the higher sales volumes, and benefits from our previously announced streamlining actions, partially offset by higher employee-related cost, including incentive compensation.","During the first quarter of fiscal 2014, we completed the closure of the 2 small production facilities, which are part of the streamlining actions initiated in the prior year. We did not record any significant incremental expense during the first quarter associated with the closing of the facilities, and we estimate that we realized approximately $3 million of pretax savings associated with the streamlining activities this quarter.","We still expect to realize total annualized savings of $15 million and believe we'll be at this full run rate by the end of the second fiscal quarter of this year. These savings should help offset important investments we are continuing to make to expand our product and solution portfolio and enhance our production, distribution and customer service and support capabilities.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 35.3%, virtually unchanged from the 35.4% in the first quarter of last year. We estimate the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 will be approximately 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","Now let's look at cash flow for the fiscal quarter ended November 30, 2013. Cash flow generated from operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2014 was $43.4 million compared with net cash used for operation of $14.5 million in the prior year. This year-over-year improvement reflects higher net income and lower working capital requirements.","Total operating working capital of 43 days at November 30, 2013 improved 5 days compared with the prior year. In the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we spent $8.5 million on capital expenditures compared with $11.2 million in the prior year period. We currently expect to spend approximately $50 million in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2014.","At November 30, 2013, we had a cash balance of $398.1 million, an increase of $39 million since the beginning of the fiscal year. Our total debt was $354 million. Consequently, our cash exceeded debt at the end of the first quarter.","At November 30, 2013, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.8 million under our credit facility that does not mature until January 2017. So we continue to maintain a significant amount of financial flexibility.","Lastly, you may have seen early last month that Standard & Poor's raised our debt rating to BBB from BBB- with a stable outlook. They based their revised rating on our relatively strong credit metrics and that they think will be maintained in their view of modestly improving end markets. In addition, Moody's, late last month, revised our rating outlook to positive from stable and affirmed our Baa3 rating. Moody's cited favorable prospects for revenue expansion and stated as volumes improve, operating margins should strengthen. They further said that these factors, combined with a strong balance sheet, liquidity and ongoing free cash flow, should improve the company's credit stature.","Thank you, and I'll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities well beyond just the current year. With regard to our expectation for the balance of 2014, our view remains positive, which has not changed since our last quarter's conference call. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to restate what we mentioned last quarter regarding our expectations for 2014.","First, most economists expect that the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest pace. While forecast for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate is the broad lighting market in North America will grow in the mid-single-digit range for our fiscal 2014. Also, we see other signs that continue to give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators in the North American market, such as the Architecture Billings Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the rebound in residential construction, are all improving.","I would also note we continue to be somewhat leery of the next round of uncertainty to come out of Washington regarding the debt ceiling discussions and monetary policy. As you know, the manner in how these key issues are resolved can influence business and consumer confidence. Nonetheless, we continue to expect that overall demand in our end markets for 2014 will continue to improve and be more broad-based and consistent than in 2013 but still with some volatility in demand among certain sales channels and geographies.","The continued favorable trend in our order rate seems to support this level of improvement. Also, as a reminder, the second quarter for us is typically our weakest quarter due to the seasonal nature of the construction market, as well as inconsistent demand from certain customers and channels as they balance inventories at their year end.","Second, the industry continues to experience some volatility with respect to input cost. While some commodity costs have waned, others continue to rise. We are increasingly concerned that certain component and material input costs could start to rise, except for certain LED components, which should continue to decline.","Further, we expect employee-related costs will continue to rise due to wage inflation and higher incentive compensation due to performance, as well as the negative impact of Obamacare on health care costs. Of course, we will continue to be vigilant on our pricing posture, as well as furthering efforts to drive productivity, improvements to help offset rising cost, as evidenced by the expected benefits in fiscal year 2014 from streamlining actions we took in the second half of fiscal 2013.","Next, while our gross profit margin is influenced by sales volume, as well as product and sales channel mix, we expect our gross profit margin will continue to improve over time, as it did this quarter, as volume grows, particularly for larger, new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","Additionally, we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and sales channels, such as home improvement and larger renovation projects. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly, we expect to continue to outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform. As we have noted in our last several conference calls, our strategies to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same. We continue to see opportunities in this environment, including benefits from growing portions of the market, further expansion in under-penetrated geographies and channels and growth from the introduction of new lighting solutions.","Our strong results reflect the solid execution of these strategies by our associates. Our company-wide strategy is straightforward: expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will produce -- that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are funding these activities today because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market, and our sales growth reflects what we believe are the early stages of this opportunity. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront.","We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential. As the North American market leader, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you, and with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Matt McCall from BB&T Capital Markets.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So on that SG&A line, I'm just trying to connect all the dots and understand the expectations going forward, make sure I understand it. You've helped in the past -- I think Vern was providing kind of a fixed variable breakdown. But if you take into account your planned investments, you take into account the expected savings, and then as comps get tougher, I would assume maybe incentive comp eases a little bit, can you just give us some kind of idea about how you plan to leverage it as we move through the years maybe relative to what we've been told in the past?","Vernon J. Nagel","So Matt, our incentive compensation programs are pure pay-for-performance. It's based on period-over-period performance. This quarter's results were, again, as you mentioned, great. They were just outstanding. And so based on -- it's formulaic -- based on the formulas that we have, and it impacts virtually all of the salaried folks in our organization, we essentially maxed out based on the performance. So when we think about our SD&A and the components of it, in the past, we have said that freight and commissions, together, kind of average around 11.5%. And it can vary depending on the mix, so on and so forth, but that's not a bad target number. The balance is -- it's not really fixed per se because, again, incentive compensation could vary. In the past, we have said that that number probably is in the 95-ish range. Given the outperformance this quarter and how we booked that, that number probably was near $99 million to $100 million total. The incentive compensation piece, if I back that out and look at the other components, the other components were up less than 2%. So we are leveraging our fixed, if you will, SD&A base. And the incentive comp is purely based on the outsize period-over-period performance. And so what I would submit to you is that management's desire is to continue to outperform and book at a higher level of incentive compensation.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. Now that's helpful. And then, I guess, looking at -- you talked about continued strong trends into December. And I'm just curious, maybe stepping back and looking at the business overall, maybe even compare it to last cycle or look at trends more recently, but what -- are you seeing anything in the trends that says there could be incremental benefits on the margin front coming in the next couple of quarters? And what I'm getting at is you keep talking about the impact of mix and how projects are hurting mix. I'm wondering about the penetration of controls and how that's benefiting. And I'm just wondering about the trends with margins and what the patterns in your orders are telling you, if anything.","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, as we said earlier, new construction for larger projects continues to be tepid, but yet the outlook by various prognosticators is very favorable. If you look at commercial construction, the expectation is quite, quite positive, if you look at manufacturing. Just as the economy improves, as overall employment improves, these areas are influenced by that. And again, the prognosticators really show favorable trends there. We continue to see smaller and medium-sized projects be even more predominant opportunity. Renovation still is a larger portion of the mix than, say, it has been historically. We're very excited about that continuing. And then you add on top of that the potential for growth in these more traditional areas of strength for Acuity, I think it creates a level of optimism internally that, to the extent Washington doesn't do anything that derails consumer business optimism, you can see later in 2014, '15 and '16, I think, a fairly robust opportunity, a growing market for Acuity. This is why we say we believe that our markets, our addressable markets, have the opportunity over the next 3-plus years to grow at very substantial rates. And we are uniquely positioned with our product portfolio, both of conventional lighting, LED components and other products that we sell, to participate fully in this. If I look at our business -- if you go back to the first quarter of 2013, you'll recall that it was a flat quarter. I think it was up maybe 1%. And the issue back then was debt ceiling, government shutdown, all sorts of issues that we think tempered business confidence. And so you saw that back then. But if I then think about second quarter of last year, 6% growth. If I think about the third quarter, 11% growth. If I think about the fourth quarter, 13% growth. We posted 20% this quarter, so potentially, the 20% was somewhat influenced by a lesser-than-robust first quarter. But our momentum in terms of our unit volume growth continues to build. And we are working hard to execute our strategies to outperform the markets we serve. Again, we don't have precise data on what our quarter did -- or excuse me, the markets did, but we, again, believe that we meaningfully outperformed what the growth rates would have been in our traditional markets. And I would say that our order rates for December were favorable and continue to suggest this improving condition of the overall markets. So I hope that gave you some context and backdrop.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","Yes, it does. And forgive me, Dan, for the follow-up, but just from a mix perspective on the margin front as we look out, I know it's a long-winded question, but is there anything in the mix that could really benefit the margin? Or is it more leverage that we're going to be looking at and productivity gains and the like?","Vernon J. Nagel","No, we said that -- this is Vern. We said that as our mix becomes more influenced by larger new construction projects, we anticipate selling a more broad-based portfolio, which tends to have a more rich mix. So those markets of new construction tend to pull all or a lot of our products, and we do well when that happens. I would point out that if you look at our gross profit margin on virtually the same level of volume compared to what we did in the previous fourth quarter, so sequentially, we added, what, Ricky, 40 bps?","Richard K. Reece","40 basis points.","Vernon J. Nagel","Of improvement in gross profit on essentially the same mix. So we're driving productivity, and we see out there, when it happens, we can't necessarily control that, a more rich mix of products being sold into larger new construction projects in addition to what we're doing on the renovation side. So I believe that that's robust.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeff Osborne with Stifel.","Jeffrey D. Osborne - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Just 2 quick ones. In the past, there had been investor consternation with kind of the disparity or the perceived disparity of gross margins of LED products versus non-LED. I think the dramatic improvement you've seen over the past 4 to 6 quarters has kind of suggested that, that disparity may be -- or their concerns were unfounded or overstated. But is there a sense of perspective that you can give us for calendar 2013, the LED chip cost declines, how much that benefited your gross margin improvement versus some of the restructuring in utilization rates? I'm just trying to get -- if you can either rank order or dive specifically into the LED issue or perceived issue, if those things are kind of at parity now.","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes, I'd prefer not to go there because the ability of Acuity, given its size and its opportunities, it may have a different ability, if you will, to source componentry at classes that are different than folks that don't have our size, scale and capability. We will say that LED components continue to decline. The pricing of LED luminaires continues to decline. And as Ricky has pointed out in the past, that simple math allows for improvement, if you will, in the gross margin percentage on those products. I think that it is, again, very interesting to note, to your point, people in the past have assumed or made some assumptions that LED components -- excuse me, LED luminaires have, in general, lower margins as a percentage. We have said and have consistently said that our margins for similar products are in the range. And I think it's bearing out that we have the ability to continue to improve margins while LED fixtures are becoming a more and more meaningful percentage of our total. We're now over a quarter of our total revenues. So we have other items in there other than just luminaires, now LED-based luminaires, and yet our gross profit margins continue to improve. So I think that for Acuity, we've been able to debunk, if you will, the notion that somehow, LED products, in general, have a lot lower margin profile. An individual product may or may not, but that's true in, really, any product.","Richard K. Reece","Jeff, on the streamlining benefits, the savings there, the $3 million, we did recognize $3 million this quarter improvement as a result of those actions that we took late last year. About 75%, 80% of that is in the SD&A line. The remainder is in the cost of goods sold line. So there are some benefit there and then productivity gains as we leveraged the volume on our fixed cost, as well as just continuing our lean journey. And improving our supply chain cost factor has also enabled us to improve margins.","Jeffrey D. Osborne - Stifel, Nicolaus & Co., Inc., Research Division","Excellent. And the last question is just on the -- going back to the LED side again. Could you just, generically, talk about where you would perceive, in calendar 2013, you're the strongest, whether it's indoor, retrofits or outdoor residential? Where would you kind of rank order in hindsight where you've had the most success through the year and where you see some opportunities for growth in 2014 and '15?","Vernon J. Nagel","So Acuity is the North American market leader, both in indoor and outdoor luminaires. And we believe that the adoption rate of LED for certain applications, Outdoor is probably a little bit ahead of Indoor. Indoor, primarily on the Renovation side. So we have -- we believe we're in the very, very early innings of the adoption of LED into that commercial office space, and that's a big wheelhouse for Acuity. So we would look to really leverage growth there and continue to leverage our product portfolio in both Indoor and Outdoor. When we look at markets, commercial, industrial, infrastructure, the Outdoor, Indoor and Outdoor have done very, very well for us, and we expect that to continue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord.","Jonathan Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","I guess, Vern, first question. Just with respect to the TAM, you've talked about sort of the -- your business in the downturn, the total addressable market sort of being around that $10 billion number. As you added the controls, sort of adding $500 million to another $1 billion, and then as new construction comes back, seeing that sort of $10.5 billion to $11 billion over the next several years kind of growing to that, I think it was $15 billion, $16 billion level. So I was wondering if -- as your results in the second half of '13 have seen a marked increase -- or for most of the year, actually, how much you attribute to new construction versus renovation and where we are in that, where you see the total addressable market right now. And then I have a follow-up to that.","Vernon J. Nagel","So Jed, for us, we guesstimated that for fiscal 2013, our addressable market was roughly a little less than $13 billion. And so you can pick any time frame you want, but where we see growth coming from is continued renovation. If you look at the installed base here in North America, what is it, 100 billion square feet of installed building space, 70% of which was put in place before 1990. If you then further assume $2 a square foot for lighting, another $0.50 a square foot for controls and lighting solutions, it's a $250 billion market that converts at a very slow rate. So Renovation and people who are getting after that market due to energy savings but better quality of light in those spaces, it can convert faster, the better we're able to get to those types of folks. So that pond will allow us the opportunity for growth. Put on top of that now us rebounding, albeit at a slower but yet increasing rate for new construction, it's a pretty solid performance. I believe that you have seen that others -- we have a chart that shows, on an inflation-adjusted basis, what the nonresidential construction market looked like. It peaked in 2008, and it declined about 35%. It's come back about 5 points. So it's still off on an inflation-adjusted basis from its peak. We expect that to now start to come back. So not only do you have the benefit of new construction, but we also believe that we will be selling more value per square foot, don't have precise numbers around it, as we get more and more into fairly sophisticated lighting solutions to take advantage of daylight harvesting to actually generate energy savings while you're using the space. So these are some of the attributes or some of the drivers that we see pushing the market to potentially 50% higher over the next 3 to 4 years as we look forward.","Jonathan Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","It's sort of a great segue into my second question, which was going to be around -- you're seeing 25% now with LEDs. And if you go to that digital control, I would assume, but I'd like you to comment on this, that the controllability starts to become more important. So can you break out sort of that controlled aspect or what percentage of your business now versus maybe a year ago you think you have a much better shot on goal in terms of adding the controls features to maybe systems versus just a standalone device?","Vernon J. Nagel","Sure. If you -- first of all, our LED sales are more than 25%. I just want to be clear on that. They're not at 25%. The notion of lighting solutions and controls, if you sell an individual control device, sure, you can measure that. But more and more, with LED-based luminaires, virtually, all of our LED-based luminaires has some level of control embedded in it. The level of sophistication, what it can do, so on and so forth, how it interfaces with other luminaries as part of the lighting system and how that ties into building management, those are all different levels of sophistication. It is becoming impossible for us to say, that luminaire, which has a value proposition, is the value proposition and the price, is it because it has embedded controls or is it because it's LED? We don't even go there with that, Jed. It's just -- it's too hard. So what we believe is that these luminaires for a like kind compared to, say, conventional lighting, have the ability to have higher prices, and it depends, it's all over the map, based on the value and the level of control and what you're attempting to do with it. At the most sophisticated level, where it's tied into daylight harvesting and the ability to feed that back into building management systems, the system with the quality of light that we provide, the ability to have it be modular so you can upgrade it, all of these things are wonderful value propositions. And we sell that value. We're in a bid business, but we sell that value. And obviously, the growth rates that we have in our LED-based luminaires, which are way above the rest of the industry, are because we offer the full range of features and benefits.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Vern, a couple of times, I think, and in the Q, you've mentioned that you've got some under-penetrated opportunities. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit of color on what those might be without obviously getting in the competitive specifics. But if you're growing volume, it's something around 20%. You still got opportunities out there. Can you give us a little bit of insight as to where those might be, whether those are markets or geographies or technologies and then tie in just the -- the balance sheet being in a net cash position gives you a tremendous amount of flexibility. So if you can maybe add that into the commentary as well, that'd be very helpful.","Vernon J. Nagel","So in 2013, we generated $2.1 billion of revenues against a total addressable market of a little less than $13 billion. So until we get to $13 billion, I would say that our opportunities continue to be fairly robust in all areas. And I'm being a little facetious with you. But we see opportunities to expand our product portfolio of good, better, best. We're the market leader in both indoor, as well as outdoor, but yet we see just significant opportunities to add features and benefits, real value propositions to the customer base to allow us to gain share. And I would say it's across the board. And we're only limited by our own creativity and our own ability to create solutions that our customers are willing to buy. And it's not just products and solutions. If you're a contractor, it's how well can you serve that contract or how can you bring value to them to make them even more efficient. So when you think about how we bring luminaires and controls and that whole package as a solution, making it simple, plug and play, easy to install, easy to commission, all of these features and benefits have real meaning and real points of differentiation. So our investments going forward continue to be in the area of being -- of taking very sophisticated technology and making it smart and simple for people to use and install. And we believe that that's a point of differentiation that will allow us to gain additional share as we go forward. When I think about our primary channels, we sell through 14 different channels, the broadest in the industry. And if you look at -- geographically and then you look at channels, we had good growth that was broad-based, and that's what gives me and Ricky and Dan great enthusiasm around -- we're executing well locally, and our product portfolio and our lighting solutions people are listening to the voice of the customer and really bringing the kind of value that folks want. And we're able to differentiate that against our competitors, and it's allowing us to grow. You're right. We're sitting on $400 million of cash, more cash than debt today. We continue to look at acquisition opportunities, small\/medium. I wish I could say larger, not too much larger. And we will be disciplined as we have been in terms of what we would like to acquire and who we would like to be part of the family and why. So we'll continue that level of discipline. And our expectation is we'll continue to put that capital to work in the most efficient way for shareholders to realize their returns.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. All right. And then just second question, you alluded to it a little bit with the commodity inflation that you're seeing. I think we've seen a couple of competitors come out with price increases on the non-LED side. Can you maybe comment on likelihood of price increase, when, magnitude? It sounds like it's low, maybe mid-single digits on non-LED. Is that kind of a fair ballpark to be thinking about if, indeed, you need to go to the market with a price increase?","Vernon J. Nagel","No, Pete, I'm not going to comment on what our strategy will be relative to that. I will comment on our overall pricing strategy, and we are very focused on what the value proposition we can bring to the market and how we price that. Most of what we do is a bid, and so we're looking to sell features and benefits and extract the value for our shareholders but providing real value back to the customer base. And so all of us are, and when I say us, I mean Acuity, are looking at where can we extract that value, where do we need to push price into the marketplace to help us preserve and enhance our margins. So we are looking at that every day. And costs ebb and they flow, and we have to be sensitive to that. We are aggressive pricers in that we will push price up to the extent that we can add value to our customers. So I realize that some have come out with price increases. I can't comment because I don't know what their motivation was. I can tell you that we look at our pricing strategy, literally, monthly and even more than that. And in instances where we are bidding, we're pushing our prices in a way that allow us to really sell value to the customer and improve our margins. When you look at our margins at the gross profit level, we're improving those margins on similar mix. So we're very aggressive in terms of how we work our cost structure and very aggressive on how we sell our value proposition to our customer base.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jagadish Iyer from Piper Jaffray.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Two questions, Vern. First, when you talked about TAM, you talked about the gross margins for the LED side versus the non-LED portion. So how should we be thinking about it as we look at it 12 months from now in terms of how the gross margin profile, at least qualitatively, how should we think about it, given that there is going to be some formidable players going to be aggressive on this LED lighting? And then I have a follow-up.","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, the most formidable player is Acuity in LED lighting, so let me just be clear about that. We continue to expand our margins. I think that this quarter was reflective of margin expansion, again, $575 million. If you look at our just previous quarter, our fourth quarter, we did $580 million, so call that the same. We added 40 basis points of margin improvement, and yet we continue to grow our LED-based business. In truth, we do not look at -- we don't look at LED versus non-LED. We look at the application. We look at what the customer is trying to do, and we sell from a full wagon. We are not trying to push one versus the other. We're trying to push the right solution and provide the right solution to what the customer is trying to do. We believe that LEDs will continue to be a growing and more meaningful part of the business, and we are pushing that hard because it provides customers, in many instances, with a better value proposition. So we're listening to them. I think that what you can see from the expansion in our margin from fourth quarter -- at gross profit margin from fourth quarter to first quarter is a continued reflection of how we bring that value to the customers, how we price that into the market, that value proposition into the market, and how we continue to use, as Ricky pointed out in his comments, lean and other capabilities to drive productivity throughout our business. So I said earlier that we would expect our gross profit margins to, over time, continue to expand as we drive productivity, as we bring more value-oriented products to the marketplace, including lighting solutions, which are, again, sophisticated systems that are smart and simple for end users to use. And we believe that will continue to also enhance our margin profile over time.","Jagadish K. Iyer - Piper Jaffray Companies, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. Second, as a follow-up, I just wanted to understand. You did talk about some pricing pressure. I just wanted to find out, was there anything abnormal in the LED channel versus the traditional one?","Vernon J. Nagel","I would say pricing is very local, project-specific, so on and so forth. And I would say that the answer to that would be no. We don't see a differentiation necessarily between conventional and LED. We just see in local situations where that job, that project, that local influence, whatever it may happen to be, that local competitive dynamic. And I think that that is not atypical in our industry.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Vern, just -- I know you talked to the lack of a sequential decline sequentially or from quarter-to-quarter here in terms of revenues. And is there anything special here that hit this quarter, where there was some project activity that really benefited you? Or did you notice any prebuy activity? Just curious to see if we should be aware of anything that was noteworthy on that end this quarter.","Vernon J. Nagel","No. I believe that it began as a continuation of how we have been executing our strategies around our product portfolio, around providing value into the various channels and just continuing to execute pretty well along providing the right solutions to customers in those channels and in those geographies. I can't think of anything that was uniquely special or large when we think about our business. It's so broad-based, and it touches so many portions of the North American market that any one big job wouldn't necessarily influence the overall revenues. And that wasn't the case this quarter.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, all right. And then on the gross margin, a couple of quarters ago, you talked about the renovation activity being a -- having a dampening impact and whether it was the kind of the base fluorescent business and kind of the jobs that were less customized. And you had a nice uptick in the gross margin this quarter, and you seem a little more optimistic about gross margins getting better sooner than maybe what was perceived a couple of quarters ago. Is this -- I imagine the construction piece, and you talked about kind of tepid growth there, and that's a potentially a big driver to your margins in the intermediate term. But what's really changed there on the margin side? Because that's one of the things that I noticed here in this quarter aside from the top line as being definitely much better than expected. So any color there would be helpful.","Vernon J. Nagel","Sure. We believe that the mix this quarter compared to, say, the sequential fourth quarter is probably around the same. But we continue to drive productivity into our business. Our teams on our supply chain side are doing a great job. We're very focused around that. We really work hard to sell the value proposition of Acuity. We don't lead with price. We lead with features and benefits and solutions and service. So we continue to work that as part of a process, and I think we're always continuing to improve how we sell our value proposition to our various customer base. But we're working hard to continue to improve that top line and to improve the mix of our business. So while the mix didn't change materially this quarter, we see, as we look out forward, that mix improving. When does the commercial market start to improve, where it's no longer tepid, where we're actually seeing some growth? Again, whether it's a Dodge or a Global Insight or some of these other forecast companies, they have a fairly positive view of what the next 3 to 5 years look like in these key verticals where Acuity has traditionally really applied its strength and its broad value proposition. And we sell a more fulsome amount of our product compared to certain renovation projects, where it may be a single-type fixture, or only a few fixtures, where the competitive nature of the marketplace just says that the pricing on those things is going to be much more exposed than a full package would be. So our enthusiasm around margins on a go-forward basis, and I'm not talking about next quarter or the quarter after that, I'm talking about over the next 1,000 days, as these markets potentially come back, we think we're positioned well, both with our portfolio, our access to market and our complete value proposition to extract improved margin and extract value there.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. And then just one last quick one for Ricky. The $3 million of savings, did that fully flow through this quarter, or was there some offset in the SD&A line with spending? And then with the remaining, once you hit the annualized rate, the earlier or, I guess, last quarter, or the quarter before, you've discussed about some offsets. And I know you've mentioned that earlier in the call, but I mean, should we think of that as there's going to be some spending here and is that full $50 million is still not going to be -- not going to completely flow through? Is that still the right assumption?","Richard K. Reece","That is the right assumption. We continue to make investments or increase our spending in areas of sales and marketing support and so forth. So we're reinvesting some of these savings back into our SD&A cost. So while we've realized all of those savings, we are consuming some of those. As Vern commented on, as wage inflation, the cost of health care, the incentive comp, as well as we add more support capability, marketing capability, to continue to drive this growth, we will consume some of those savings in those endeavors.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","And some of that hit -- some of that $3 million was absorbed in the initiatives, right, in the quarter?","Richard K. Reece","Right, absolutely.","Vernon J. Nagel","Again, just to further comment, our quarter was an exceptional quarter on a period-over-period basis. So the way our incentive systems work and the 3 key areas are earnings growth; quality of earnings, so improving our margins; and cash flow. And they're split 1\/3-1\/3-1\/3 in terms of incentive compensation. And we were at the upper end of our performance grids in that. So we improved total operating profit margins by 140 basis points while funding a meaningful difference in incentive compensation. So for us to continue to accrue at that very high rate would require us to perform at this type of level of performance. We're not predicting that. We're not forecasting that, but we, as a management team, are incented to deliver that.","Operator","Winnie Clark from UBS, you may ask your question.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","You did talk about looking at disciplined M&A, but I was curious, you continue to have a very strong balance sheet that's strengthening further. Are you thinking any differently about capital allocation broadly at this point?","Vernon J. Nagel","Ricky?","Richard K. Reece","Not really. If you look back historically at how we've allocated our capital, we've returned about half of our free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchase. We've spent about 1\/3 of our free cash flow on acquisitions. And then the remainder, we've used for our own internal capital expenditures for organic growth. That mix isn't going to stay exactly that every quarter every year, and it's hard to predict on the M&A side. If we look at the priority, M&A would be our -- organic growth, of course, we're going to continue to do that. And then M&A, as Vern mentioned earlier, though, we're going to be disciplined about that. But you've seen us do 2 or 3 acquisitions in almost each of the last 5 years, some of them bigger, medium or much smaller. But I think you will continue to see us looking there. If we don't see the opportunity on the M&A and all, then we'll continue to look at ways to be shareholder-friendly in that and return it to shareholders in the form of repurchase of shares and the dividend.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Great, that's helpful. And then I was curious, I know you don't give forward guidance, but some companies have talked about weather and holiday timing in December and January being -- having a negative impact on their business. And I'm curious, as we think about 2Q, is that something that we should potentially consider as we adjust our models going forward?","Vernon J. Nagel","No. For us, we have seasonality in Q2. It's historically our lowest quarter in terms of top line. But no, we don't think that the cold snap-- while, unfortunately, Ricky's pipes in his house burst, his lighting is fine. So we don't think that that is going to influence our second quarter one way or the other at this stage.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon J. Nagel","Everyone, thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will, over the longer term, deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"483":["Acuity Brands, Inc.

After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Thank you, sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2014 fourth quarter and full year results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at www.acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we'll answer your questions. First, let me say we are extremely pleased with our performance in 2014. We achieved record results for net sales, diluted earnings per share, and cash flow generation for both the fourth quarter and the full year.","For the full year and the fourth quarter, net sales grew 15%, which was meaningfully higher than the estimated mid-single-digit growth rate for the key markets we serve. In fact, this was the sixth quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a meaningful accomplishment in this environment. We believe these results are yet again a strong evidence our strategies to provide our customers with differentiated value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position in North America.","These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity. Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter and the full year were records for Acuity, even as we continue to fund our strong sales growth and areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and lighting controls portfolio.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights, first for the quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were a quarterly record of $669 million, an increase of over 15% compared with the year-ago period. Operating profit was $90.7 million compared with $78.2 million in the year-ago period. Operating profit margin was a robust 13.6%, up 10 basis points from the year-ago period. Diluted earnings per share were a record $1.26 compared with diluted EPS of $1.03 in the year-ago period, up 22%, strong quarterly results indeed.","For the full year, net sales at Acuity were a record $2.4 billion, up almost 15% from 2013. Operating profit was $1 million shy of $300 million compared with $222 million in the year-ago period, up 35%. Adjusted operating profit was $293 million or 12.2% of net sales compared with $247 million or 11.8% of net sales in the year-ago period. Diluted EPS was $4.05 compared with $2.95 per share in 2013, up 37% while adjusted diluted EPS was $3.97 per share compared with $3.31 in the year-ago period, up 20% from 2013.","In addition, we generated $233 million in net cash provided by operating activities this year, while funding a $55 million increase in accounts receivable due to our record sales growth. As Ricky will discuss later, we meaningfully enhanced our already strong financial position in 2014 as we now have more than $550 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, far exceeding our debt at slightly more than $350 million.","Lastly, I'm pleased to report that we once again earned much more than our cost of capital and our cash flow return on investment was a robust 29%, the second highest in our history and far in excess of most in the electrical industry. These results for the quarter and full year were significant improvements over the year-ago periods. We believe you will find our results for the quarter and the year even more impressive upon further analysis.","While net sales for the fourth quarter grew more than 15% compared with the year-ago period, we estimate our sales volume grew almost 17%, partially offset by lower price mix and to a lesser degree the impact of foreign currency. While it's not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on like-kind LED luminaires between periods reflecting the decline in certain LED component costs.","The increase in net sales was broad-based along most product lines, including certain specialty fixture types more closely associated with new construction as we began to see an uptick in this important market.","From a channel perspective, we continued to experience strong growth in the commercial, industrial, and infrastructure. Sales growth in our largest channel, commercial and industrial, was above this quarter's overall percentage increase as we continue to focus on projects for new construction and renovation in both the non-residential and residential markets as well as continued emphasis on selling higher value-added lighting solutions, especially LED luminaires, where sales of our LED products almost doubled again this quarter compared with the year-ago period, an extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED-based luminaires now account for 40% of our total sales.","Our rate of growth for LED luminaires continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, demonstrating our market-leading prowess. Excluding LED luminaires, we believe the puts and takes for product pricing as well as material and component costs were again fairly benign this quarter.","Looking at market conditions for the fourth quarter, we believe the North American lighting market was up mid single-digits during the quarter supported by growth in renovation as well as the residential market. This is in stark contrast compared with the growth rate of our net sales in North America, which was up more than 15%.","Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments. As we noted earlier, our fourth quarter operating profit was $90.7 million, the most in our history, and operating profit margin for the fourth quarter was a robust 13.6%. More impressive was our gross profit margin for the quarter, which came in at 42.4%, up 150 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter. The expansion of our gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales, favorable sales channel mix, and productivity improvements, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.","Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses were up $34 million, or 21%, on the net sales increase of 15%. SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.8% in the quarter, an increase of 140 basis points from the year-ago period.","This next point is very important. The increase in our SDA expense was primarily due to higher variable cost for freight and selling commissions to support the record growth in net sales, and a $15 million increase in our variable employee incentive compensation expense, which is based on our bonus program plan design that incents or rewards strong period-over-period growth.","Our performance, which is measured along three key metrics of profit growth, margin improvement and cash flow generation, this year compared with the year-ago period placed us above the 75th percentile of our benchmark industries, driving the increase in our employee incentive-based compensation expense, a positive reward for record performance.","Another way to view just how robust our fourth quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin, adjusting for this net increase in employee incentive compensation in order to make it comparable to the same period last year. Doing so, our variable contribution on the incremental sales of $89 million was almost 31%, strong results indeed.","The story was much the same for the full year's record results. Net sales grew 15% this year, almost three times the estimated growth rate of our addressable market. Gross profit margin was 40.9%, up 40 basis points compared with the prior year's adjusted gross profit margin. Adjusted operating profit was 12.2%, which included a $31 million increase in our variable employee incentive compensation expense, improved 40 basis points over 2013.","Be very clear, variable employee incentive compensation is an integral part of our business model, which is based on aggressive period-over-period improvement performance. However if one were to adjust for the net increase in our full year employee incentive compensation expense, so as to make the year-over-year comparisons meaningful, our operating profit margin increased by 130 basis points and the variable contribution margin for the incremental sales in 2014 would have been over 25%. All in all, we had a great year.","On the strategic front, we accomplished a great deal in 2014, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth in profitability in 2015 and beyond. Internally we've made great strides on a number of fronts by further accelerating the deployment of our lean business processes. For example, we improved our productivity through the organization. One measure of productivity is net sales per associate, which increased almost 11% in 2014. Another area of strong improvement was in our service to customers where late backlog declined to a historical low, while on-time delivery was at an all time high.","From a product and lighting solutions development perspective, we continued our rapid pace of new product introductions, significantly expanding our industry leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions. To put this in perspective, we now offer our customers more than 1.7 million SKUs to choose from, more than three times as many as we had in 2008. No other lighting company offers customers more choices and more solutions than Acuity Brands.","Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our lighting controls and solid-state lighting product offering. For the full year, our LED sales more than doubled compared with 2013. This is an extraordinary achievement when you again consider that if our LED sales were measured as a standalone company, we believe it would be the fourth largest lighting luminaire company in North America, while we believe our conventional business would still be number one.","Also we continue to fund the development of holistic integrated lighting solutions for specific applications such as schools, healthcare facilities, commercial office buildings and various outdoor applications to fully leverage our award-winning portfolio of lighting fixtures, controls and components. Additionally, we continue the development of luminaires incorporating other light source technologies such as organic LEDs where we continue to expand our award-winning portfolio of these innovative products.","More impressively, our adjusted operating profit margin continued to expand this quarter and this year, while sales of LED-based solutions have become an even larger portion of our overall business. Acuity is a clear leader in providing customers with superior lighting solutions incorporating either convention or solid-state light sources.","The market has come to understand that LED as a light source is no longer a new technology, now widely accept the attention of customers is focused and how once can best control a new light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing the benefit of its long life and energy savings characteristics, because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of LED to optimize the visual environment and provide significant energy savings through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application. We are growing significantly faster than virtually all of our major competitors.","At Acuity, we view the advent of LED as an enabler, affording us the opportunity to bring differentiated lighting solutions to a broad array of customers, distancing us from our competitors. Our expertise lies in the true understanding of the proper use and control of light while minimizing the use of energy. We are without equal in the design and development of fixtures and integrated lighting systems for virtually any application without a bias of the light source. Our formidable strength and innovation was on full display again in 2014 where Acuity LED lighting and control solutions as well as for our new line of organic LED products.","As I have noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during areas of technology disruption and that is even more true today. Acuity Brands is leading the evolution to intelligent lighting solutions with its broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor solid-state and traditional energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls. And we are delivering profitable growth in strong financial returns for our shareholders while making these important investments.","These accomplishments have diversified and strengthened our foundation and will further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new commercial construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our 7,000 associates who are focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2015. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. Vern covered the primary drivers for our fourth quarter and full year sales growth and our profitability. So I'll not repeat these items.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 33.2% compared with 36.1% in the fourth quarter of last year. The lower income tax rate was primarily attributable to favorable adjustments to certain discrete items. In addition, the prior-year fourth quarter tax rate was unfavorably impacted by a change in UK tax laws, which resulted in a reduction of certain deferred tax assets. The effective tax rate for the full year of 33.8% was relatively flat compared with 34.0% in the prior year. We estimate the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 will be approximately 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout that year.","As Vern mentioned earlier, cash flow generated from operations for fiscal year 2014 was a very impressive $233 million, which is more than $100 million over the prior year. The significant year-over-year improvement reflects higher net income and lower working capital requirements as compared with the prior-year period.","Our operating working capital defined as account receivables plus inventory less accounts payable decreased five days to an industry-leading 33 days and represents only about 12.5% of revenue. Most of this improvement was in our management of inventory where we continue to improve our inventory turns while also improving our service levels.","In fiscal year 2014, we spent approximately 1.5% of revenue or $35.3 million on capital expenditures compared with $40.6 million in the prior year. This reduction in spending was due to some large projects in fiscal year 2013 that did not repeat and delays in certain projects this year that got pushed into fiscal year 2015. We currently expect to spend approximately 2% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2015. This expected uptick in capital expenditures is due to the projects that were delayed from fiscal year 2014 and investments necessary to support our growth.","In fiscal year 2014, our free cash flow, which we define as cash flow from operations less capital expenditures, was $197.8 million. This is the sixth year out of the last eight years that we achieved our target of having our free cash flow exceed net income, which we believe speaks to the quality of our earnings and efficient management of our working capital and capital investments.","At August 31, 2014, we had a cash balance of $552.5 million, an increase of $193.4 million since the beginning of the fiscal year. Our total debt was $354 million. Consequently, our cash exceeded debt at the end of the fiscal year. At August 31, 2014, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.8 million under our credit facility. During our fourth quarter, we amended and extended our credit facility, improving the pricing and terms and extended its maturity so we have five years remaining on its tenure.","We have a significant amount of cash on our balance sheet, continue to generate a lot of cash and have access to additional capital based on our extended credit facility. So you're probably asking what are our priorities for all of this capital. Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. First, we will invest in capital expenditures for maintenance, cost savings and growth initiatives, which is expected to be around 1.5% to 2% of revenue per year.","Next, we will seek strategic acquisitions to add technology, fill product gaps and\/or expand our market access. The timing of acquisitions of course are hard to predict. And quite frankly, we would have expected to have been more active this year in M&A. We remain very disciplined in our acquisition activities and will continue to seek desirable acquisitions at appropriate valuations.","Lastly, we will continue to return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. In fact, over the last decade, we have returned approximately half of our free cash flow to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks. We clearly have significant financial strength and flexibility and will continue to see the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you and I'll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever changing and evolving, particularly for Acuity. Our expectations for growth of the lighting industry primarily in North America has not changed much over the last few quarters. We remain very positive. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide you with some observations for fiscal 2015.","First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest to increasing pace. Our forecast for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely. The consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North American is expected to grow mid to upper single-digit range for our fiscal 2015, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity.","Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators in the North American markets such as the architectural billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the rebound in residential construction continue to improve. As has become the normal over the last handful of years, we are always leery of the next round of uncertainty that might come out of Washington, including potential noise around the mid-term elections as well as fiscal and foreign policy issues.","As you know, the manner in how these key issues are handled can meaningfully influence business and consumer confidence. Nonetheless, we continue to expect that overall demand in our end markets for the next 12 months will continue to improve and be more broad-based and consistent than that experienced in either 2013 or 2014. The continued favorable trend in our September order rate again seems to support this continuing level of improvement.","Second, excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input cost over the next 12 months as some commodity costs have waned, while others continue to rise. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise due to wage inflation and the negative impact of rising healthcare cost. As you know, our employee incentive compensation programs are variable in nature and designed to incent and reward period-over-period performance based on aggressive improvement along three key shareholder-centric measures.","Put differently, our incentive compensation plan is what everyone regards as a pure pay-for-performance. In 2014, our incentive compensation was meaningfully higher than in 2013 due to our record performance. So we enter 2015 where a high performance base is already in our cost structure on which to compare future performance. Assuming similar year-over-year performance in 2015 as we achieved in 2014, the increase in incentive compensation in 2015 would then be minimal.","But again, let me be very clear, as your management team and fellow shareholders, we have every incentive in the world to outperform the record performance we delivered in 2014, which would result in an increase in incentive compensation in 2015.","Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange fluctuations, which are impossible to predict. Of course, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture as well as furthering our efforts to drive productivity improvements to help offset rising cost.","Another observation, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, price, product and sales channel mix and innovation, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as values grow, particularly for larger new construction projects which would also benefit our mix and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","Our gross profit margin in the fourth quarter was a good example of our potential, but we prefer to look at our margin improvements over a 12-month period to remove quarterly anomalies like last year's second quarter due to weather to discern proper trends. You should do the same. It's a positive picture.","Additionally, we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and sales channels. We will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly and most importantly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the introduction of holistic lighting solutions like connecting smart lighting with smartphones for retailers as well as our growing electronic component capabilities.","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, our strategies to drive profitable growth remains essentially the same. We continue to see opportunities in this environment including benefits from growing portions of the market, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels and growth from the introduction of new lighting solutions. Our positive results reflect the solid execution of these strategies.","Our company-wide strategy is straightforward. Expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. So all it takes are focus and resources. We are funding these activities today, because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our record growth supports this view.","As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the internet of things. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential. As the North American market leader, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you and with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Our first question is Rick Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities.","Rick Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Ricky, on the $15 million increase in incentive comp, what should we think of as a normal run rate here in kind of a normalized year, because when we add back, that's pretty significant in terms of EPS, but I assume in a normal year, you would incur some level of comp, so I'm just trying to get the right comparison and the right way to think about it.","Vern Nagel","This year, we obviously had record performance and all of our employee incentive compensation programs are really driven towards driving pay-for-performance. And so what you saw this year was essentially us exceeding the 75th percentile along three key measurements. Again, we said earnings growth, operating profit margin improvement, and cash flow generation. So that 75th percentile cost structure is now baked in, if you will, into our cost structure. Obviously, we have every incentive to continue to outperform even that level of growth.","So the reason that we provided you with this notion of the comparable, variable contribution margin was so that folks could understand that the incentive comp was the piece that was driving that in a way that as we go forward you'll see us be able to deliver that kind of variable contribution on a net adjusted basis.","Rick Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","So we should think of this as kind of the new base and then if you happen to underperform that, then it's a positive to earnings as we think about '15?","Vern Nagel","Yes. And again, it's not our objective to underperform that. Our history over the last decade has been typically that we have way outperformed the markets that we serve, and so our incentive compensation has really always been in a pay-for-performance environment baked into our cost structure. 2013 frankly was a little bit of an anomaly, in that, we incurred some inefficiencies that was due to our management or the lack thereof, and so obviously our incentive compensation was reduced in 2013. And now going forward, we think we're on a more of a catch-up kind of mode.","Rick Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","In terms of fixed SD&A, Vern, was that \u2013 did you hit that $105 million this quarter?","Vern Nagel","Actually, if we exclude the incentive comp, which I don't want to, all the rest of our costs were very consistent with, say, the third quarter for example, still up from the year-ago period, because we've added headcount into our business. If you look at our total salaried headcount excluding bonus as a percentage of sales, it actually has declined on a year-over-year basis. But if we look at the spending that we had in total bonus in the fourth quarter, our total bonus accrual in the fourth quarter was $15 million higher than what it was in the year-ago period.","In fact, what we booked in the fourth quarter was more than all of what we booked in 2013 just to again put that in perspective. So the run rate that I would expect on our bonus going forward is what we've baked in, if you will, what we've earned in 2014. And then if I look at those other sort of fixed costs, that number is probably in the $95 million range.","Now having said all of that, we will continue to invest in headcount. We will continue to invest in our SDA area. But what you should expect to see from Acuity is us continuing to leverage that SDA base down, so that as a percentage of sales, our SDA will continue to decline as we continue to improve our revenues till the actual dollars that we will invest there continue to grow.","Rick Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","So, it is at $95 million, which we still think at some point in '15 you\u2019ll get to $105 million a quarter?","Vern Nagel","Well, again, the $95 million, let's make sure we're talking about an apple to an apple, the $95 million right now excludes the incentive comp. I would say that incentive comp, if we look at it for the full year, Rick, I believe it was $40 million. So let's call it $10 million a quarter. So $105 is probably the leverageable number. But again, what I really want to make clear is that we are improving and we did in 2014, we grew our net sales per head by 11%, so while we will continue to drive productivity in our business, we will also continue to invest in our business.","Rick Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities","Was there any positive impact in terms of timing of projects this quarter that helped get you to that level or was that kind of normal mix for the lack of a better term?","Vern Nagel","Well, what we did start to see is a little bit more of a favorable mix because of some of the new construction coming back, a couple of favorable signs. Our specialty businesses, a number of them, which are more directly related to new construction, had nice growth in the quarter. And as we have said in the past, typically when we have a large new construction project, we see a much broader base of product being selected there, and typically there is more value add in terms of the product and the service that is provided on those types of projects.","And so, our expectation is that new construction will continue to rebound as we enter 2015 and beyond. So I think you started to see a little bit of what we'll call channel mix that was favorable to us, but the sales volume obviously was a contributor to that and productivity. Again, I take my hat off to our team throughout the organization where we drilled great productivity.","Operator","Next question, Jed Dorsheimer, Canaccord Genuity, your line is open.","Jed Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity","I guess first question, Vern, I was wondering if you could comment, the move to LED and we'll maybe just throw OLED in there as well, but sort of this analog to digital transition, with respect to gross margin, is there any metric that you could help us with that you're tying percentage of systems versus simply a fixture sale that you're starting to see or how we could better model on a go-forward basis?","Vern Nagel","Jed, if you again go back to 2008, last high watermark in non-residential construction, by the way, we're still down in an inflation-adjusted basis here in the US almost 20% from that last high watermark and yet we're still delivering record results. If you look at our sales today, 40% of our revenues are LED-based luminaires. And if you look at the features and benefits within those luminaires, there is control devices on there, there's all dimmable. So the feature and benefit set is dramatically different than the same, if you will, light fixture in the conventional side, which needs to have electronic balance and needs to have other features in it to perform at the same level.","So you are seeing this migration to a more capable luminaire and the ability to do more things with it. We are very excited by our in-light capability. This is our software to control luminaires in a lighting environment, room tied into a building floor, tied into an entire building, tied into the building management system, taking advantage of daylight harvesting. All of these systems are really in their infancy. No longer is LED considered a new technology. What's really new, what customers are asking for is how can you help me design smart solutions that are simple for me to use. And so they're paying for those kinds of things. But I believe we're still in our infancy as a market in that solution cell and we call it a tiered solutions approach.","So where we are from a tiered solutions approach is again primarily we call tier 1 where it's devices that features and benefits are a price point. Tier 2 now starts to have more control capability, dimmability. When you think dimming, you think energy savings. Tier 3 solution is now tying it together holistically where multiple fixtures are working in unison, as part of a program to take advantage of daylight harvesting now being tied into building management.","We're starting to see a migration down there, but yet it's difficult to actually put a precise number of profitability. We do see higher profit margins as we expand down tiered approach and it would be our expectation to continue to see that type of margin improvement over the longer term. But right now, I've given you something that you can actually model. I think we're still a little bit too early in the game to do that.","Jed Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity","So is it fair to say that the tier 3 or the total system solution is sort of where LED was three years ago from expectations perspective?","Vern Nagel","Whether it's precisely that timeframe or not, I don't know. Many competitors are out there with different types of solutions. They're still a challenge. The notion of Acuity focusing on creating smart and simple solutions that are user-friendly, we're starting to see a great deal of traction as we bring together the entire portfolio that we have. As you know, go back a handful of years ago, we've put to work over $0.5 billion in capital through acquisition of controls business, acquiring talent. We're now bringing these systems to market and we're just starting to do that and the response has been very, very favorable.","Jed Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity","There were just a lot of numbers in terms of fixed versus variable, so I wanted to reconcile the variable. I thought I heard there was a $31 million increase year-over-year. Is that for the entire year, so '13 over '14 was $31 million or is that for Q4 over Q4?","Vern Nagel","So to be very clear, in Q4 our incentive compensation increased period-over-period by $15 million. For the full year, our incentive compensation increased about $31 million year-over-year.","Operator","Next question, Winnie Clark, UBS, your line is open.","Winnie Clark - UBS","You noted price continues to be neutral other than for certain LED products. Some of your competitors recently have indicated there's been some pressure. So I'm wondering is it your mix versus others that maybe explains why you aren't seeing that in your business?","Vern Nagel","Again, we continue to see pricing dynamics in every channel, in every geography, but to say that this quarter was different than the previous quarter, what we're commenting on is that it still seems to us to be pretty much the same. In many of our channels, it's bid business and so you have to be very competitive. But what we try to do is really sell value, features and benefits, our service capabilities and why that is a better value than someone else who may be out there simply offering a lower price that can't offer the type of range of value to customers. So again, our sense is we touch so many different channels, so many different geographies, it just didn't feel to us like there was any meaningful change that would be worth noting.","Winnie Clark - UBS","In terms of the various channels, what are you seeing anything notable among the various channels, points of strengths versus weakness, et cetera?","Vern Nagel","Well, again as I mentioned earlier, we continue to see strength in our commercial, industrial and infrastructure businesses or channels, if you will. I would expect those to continue. We have a kind of portfolio that really is value creating, so whether it be for renovation or new construction, we're extremely competitive. We expect that the home improvement channel will be a growth channel for us again in 2015. We're bullish about 2015 across many channels.","And I would also say that, again as I noted earlier, our specialty businesses are now on an uptick and that generally is reflective of an improving new construction market which again is favorable for Acuity.","Operator","Next question, Tim Weiss, Baird, your line is open.","Tim Weiss - Robert W. Baird","New non-residential construction, I was wondering what you're seeing in the marketplace. I guess there's been some false starts in the past, but some of the data out there recently suggests that a little bit more of a broader recovery that's starting on. I guess what I wanted to see if you agree with that statement. If you could break it into two silos in terms of private and maybe public or institutional what you're seeing in those specific markets from a new non-residential construction basis.","Vern Nagel","Tim, our approach is very straightforward. We use different analysts, different information whether it be Dodge, Global Insights, NEMA. And what we then try to do is correlate that or investigate with our customer base, are they seeing the same. You look at all this data. If you look at again vacancy rates, the architectural billing index, if you look at absorption, credit availability, the Doge Momentum Index is a great indicator. And all of these things have been flashing green signals.","When we talk with our end customers whether they're electrical distributor partners or whether they're architects, engineers, lighting designers, contractors, all of them have discussed being more busy and looking to add to their human capability to support what they see as growth. So for us, all of these indicators continue to flash green and we are certainly aggressively putting our shoulder behind our efforts to really drive growth in the various channels that we serve. So it's a collage of many indicators, all seemingly are favorable right now.","Tim Weiss - Robert W. Baird","Ricky, you made a comment on expecting to be a little bit more active in your prepared remarks on M&A. And I guess maybe some color around what deviated versus your expectations, was it a function of higher multiples less attractive assets, maybe just some color there would be helpful. And then what the pipeline internally looks like right now?","Ricky Reece","It's very hard to predict the timing of acquisitions. We're very active in the market, looking at things that meet the criteria we're looking at, technology, filling in product gaps, expanding channel access and so forth. Extremely busy this year, looking at opportunities and so forth, but it needs to be a desirable acquisition, so as we get into it and look back, what is it really bringing, is it going to bring the capabilities and the strength that we had anticipated. We don't always have a pan out from a desirability and then on some instances certainly the valuation as people expectations may be a little richer than we would think is appropriate to get the kind of returns that our shareholders would expect from it.","So we are very diligent. I think if you look back at our M&A track record, we've done some dozen or more acquisitions in the last decade, virtually of which have added very well to our EVA. Our return on invested capital, I think, speaks to that. As Vern said, we were second highest in our year this year after investing $0.5 billion. So we're going to stay very diligent. We'll be very active, but we're not going to get emotionally attached to one and do it just because we want to get bigger or we have some emotional attachment. So it's got to be desirable and then it's got to be at valuation that gives the proper return to our shareholders to justify the risk that any acquisition brings.","So you should count on us to continue to be diligent, but active in that market.","Operator","Next question, Matt McCall, BB&T Capital Markets, your line is open.","Matt McCall - BB&T Capital Markets","I guess the new construction commentary is pretty encouraging. Can you help us think about what you're expecting your new construction business versus renovation retrofit mix will look like next year?","Vern Nagel","So I think if you go back to 2008, again I just use that as a reference point, we guesstimate it's impossible to precisely know that 80% of our revenues were driven of some type of new construction, 20% some type of renovation. Today we guesstimate that our business is split evenly, 50\/50 between new and renovation. We have learned how to really fish in that renovation pond well and we will continue to drive our capabilities there. But as you know, we are uniquely positioned to respond to new construction demand.","So I don't have a forecast or a precise target in mind as to what that mix would be. But suffice it to say, we expect both of those types of businesses, if you will, they're not separate businesses, to grow quite significantly over the next handful of years. Renovation is a huge market. I think the estimates are it's a $300 billion market, 70% of which was installed before 1990 converting at a very slow pace. So the faster that companies like Acuity can reach into that installed base and convince those building owners to update their lighting and their lighting solutions capabilities with our products, it really represents again a growth cycle.","So I'm bullish on both, if you will, our continued focus on renovation as well as hopefully reemerging and consistently reemerging new construction cycle.","Matt McCall - BB&T Capital Markets","You talked about before the bigger addressable market you have, as we move into a better construction period, can you help us understand the concept of value per square foot and how your offerings are changed and what that should be to the value you're able to offer each new square foot of space?","Vern Nagel","If you go back into the early 2000s, 1990s, as light sources transitioned from T12 to T8 to T5, people always understood the notion of more efficient use of energy and what we see now today not just with LED-based luminaires, but how we can control them and how we can take advantage of dimming capabilities consistently while people are in their space, it really provides for quite a payback story. So I believe building owners are now well aware again of the features and benefits of newer technology, what it can mean for them.","So people are looking at how can I enhance my visual environment while I take advantage of new energy savings we can get. So we're pretty excited about how folks perceive that. And our expectation is that that will continue to drive the markets as we go forward.","Operator","Next question, Chris Glynn, Oppenheimer, your line is open.","Chris Glynn - Oppenheimer","Ricky, talking about the acquisition picture, you mentioned technologies and product gaps. I'm just wondering how you're thinking about just pure consolidation as a core part of your acquisition strategy.","Ricky Reece","Certainly we will look at opportunities to gain scale whether it be small or larger consolidations, obviously looking at what synergies can we create to create shareholder value there. Just getting bigger to get bigger is not necessarily our strategy. But if there's obvious synergies either on the cost side or on the market side, absolutely we would look at that and want to be a consolidator in that space. But I wouldn't say that that is our primary focus, but it would be an area that we would certainly look at as we look at others.","Operator","Your next question, Colin Rusch, Northland Capital Markets, your line is open.","Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets","Can you guys talk a little bit about expected lifetimes and potential (inaudible) at the early stages of the technology evolution. (Technical difficulty).","Vern Nagel","From a product lifecycle perspective, we do see product lifecycles shortening. As again the efficacy of light sources continue to evolve, I think we have tooled our organization to be quite responsive to that short cycle of opportunity. The replacement, as we mentioned earlier, continues to be huge. The amount of replacement that's occurred to date has been fairly de minimis. So there's quite a bit of runway left. Companies like Acuity that sell the value of the enhancing that visual environment while getting energy savings is a unique capability.","The new construction cycle, virtually everyone who is looking to build a building today that is a total cost of ownership type person is looking at LED technology with the ability to incorporate our smart and simple controls where again people can use these things in a very simple fashion. We think that there is a lot of opportunity there for that.","So while cycles for new product development will, I think, again shrink particularly as the light source LED becomes more efficacious over time, you'll continue to redesign or design your luminaires to take cost out. But we've been doing that quite effectively. If you go back just again when we first started with LED just shortly after 2008, today 40% of our revenues and we've been almost doubling every quarter over the year-ago period, we've become very skilled at how to manage that product lifecycle management to continue to bring more value.","Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets","When you look at your R&D spend and look at how much of that spend is going towards new design and then how much is going towards software, can you talk a little bit about the trajectory (technical difficulty) going forward?","Vern Nagel","R&D is a little bit of a misnomer. We spend probably $30 million, $35 million a year in pure R&D, but we spend an enormous amount of money in product and solutions development. And those are engineers who are responding to the voice of the market around product and solutions development. The notion of solutions to us is different today than it was five years ago. Again, as I mentioned earlier, we look at how we provide customers with solutions along a tiered approach. Five years ago, Acuity was primarily in what would be tier 1, product, devices, features and benefits, price, that's how you do it. Today, we're offering customers holistic turnkey solutions. More of what we call tier 3 requires us to now have different type of skill set, a human skill set. And we have been transitioning over the last few years of saying that we're not going to do certain things in a conventional world and investing heavily in the talent to really drive that tier 3 approach.","So I think if you look at Acuity even two short years from now, you'll see us having folks that are more involved in software development, connecting to this notion of internet of things. You saw that Acuity in conjunction with Qualcomm introduced a retail GPS system that is really second to none. So we will continue to drive those types of capabilities, because for us they represent incremental revenue sources that are attractive because of the value that they bring to our end customers.","Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets","Are you seeing any evolution in terms of maturation of financing mechanisms? Are you seeing new sources of capital for financing?","Vern Nagel","We do see a number of opportunities to sell, if you will, a different value proposition than simply saying I have a fixture that can go into your space. There has been more for opportunities for which financing will be an integral part of that, but not the only part of it frankly. The service element, the quality of light, how people use the space, you have to do that really well and then you can add on some of these other attributes of a potential transaction that people will find very compelling.","Operator","Next question, Glen Wortman of Sidoti & Company, your line is open.","Glen Wortman - Sidoti & Company","Just wanted to make sure I understood the moving parts on incentive base comp. So if you were to generate similar margin, earnings growth and free cash flow improvement in fiscal '15 compared with fiscal '14, then we shouldn't expect to see much change?","Vern Nagel","You would not expect to see much change in the period-over-period incentive compensation expense. Just to put that in perspective, again I think it's an interesting fact, if you look at this fourth quarter and you compare it to our previous third quarter, our revenues increased about $65 million. The variable contribution at the operating profit level was 30%. And that includes, in this case a $60 million increase in the variable compensation expense, our fourth quarter we rocked it and the full year was a solid full year. So we were doing a little bit of catch-up in the fourth quarter compared with previous couple of quarters around the rate of our incentive compensation.","If you add that back, our variable contribution just to compare an apple to an apple of the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, that variable contribution on the incremental sales dollar was 55%. So what we're trying to explain to all of you is the fact that we have now baked in what we would consider to be a high performance level of incentive compensation into our cost structure, so that when we get into 2015, if we were to deliver the same type of incremental sales growth, you should expect to see our variable contribution margin being 25%-plus and you wouldn't see us explaining as a variance why we had more incentive compensation over the year-ago period.","I hope all that makes sense, but again please realize that we have every incentive in the world to outperform what we did this year. So we're focused on that.","Operator","Our last question comes from Mike Ritzenthaler, Piper Jaffray.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Based on past construction cycles, I was wondering about the effect of an improving end market on price. I know the couple of quarters we've seen a little bit of dip on price, but volumes have been good. I guess one would think that as everyone in the chain gets busier, it would materially lift the price\/mix bucket of your revenue growth. I'm just wondering as we look through '15, if those end markets do improve, what could the potential lift on price be with the current product mix?","Vern Nagel","What I will say is that we do expect to have a richer mix, if you will, from a profitability perspective as the new construction cycle comes back, because we will be selling a broader portfolio of our products and our services that tend to generate more margin for us because of the breadth and the scale and the capability of not only our portfolio, but our people.","On pricing, again my expectation is that the market is a competitive market. It'll always be a bid market and we will win based on how well we differentiate our portfolio and our services. So that's how I expect us to win. If there is an opportunity in the bid world to differentiate our value and extract more price, we do that every day. Is that going to be different when others are busy? I don't know. I won't guess on that.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vern Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the longer term continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"482":["Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) Q3 2014 Earnings Conference Call July  1, 2014 10:00 AM ET","","Executives","C.

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question and answer session. To ask a question, press star, one and record your name. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","","C. Dan Smith, Jr.","Thank you. Good morning. With me today to discuss our third quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at www.acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we\u2019ll be happy to answer your questions.","Our results for the third quarter of 2014 were very solid. Our net sales increased almost 12% this quarter exceeding $600 million in the quarter for the first time in our history while we earned $1 per share. In fact, this was the fifth quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit sales volume growth. In addition we continued to make excellent progress with a number of strategic initiatives as I will mention later in the call. Also noteworthy, sales of LED-based lighting solutions now make up more than a third of our total sales.","We believe this level of growth is yet again positive evidence our strategies to provide customers with differentiated value propositions to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position in North America. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting solutions, expansion in key channels and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity.","Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter were again strong, even as we continued to fund our robust sales growth as well as other areas with significant future growth potential, including the rapid expansion of our lighting solutions and components portfolios. I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide in more detail later, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter; however, before doing so, I would like to comment on two abnormal items impacting this quarter.","First, with regard to the warranty issue we noted last quarter due to a design defect in an older, incandescent emergency lighting product, we took an additional pretax charge of $2.1 million this quarter based on additional facts and information that became available to us this quarter.","As you will recall, we took a charge last quarter related to this issue noting at that time it was our best estimate of the cost to resolve the issue. We further noted those estimates were subject to potential additional facts and information. While this is still true, we believe the charge this quarter plus the charge taken in the second quarter reflects the total costs necessary to resolve this matter.","Second, the impact of foreign currency primarily due to a weakening Canadian dollar reduced our gross profit this quarter by approximately $2.1 million. As Ricky will explain later, the level of foreign currency impact we have experienced the last two quarters is abnormal for us. We believe these two items reduced our gross profit and operating profit margins in the quarter by approximately 70 basis points. The total impact of these items reduced diluted EPS this quarter by approximately $0.06. We have taken appropriate actions in the second and third quarters to address the design issue. We of course remain somewhat exposed to currency fluctuations as they are very difficult to forecast.","Now let us review our reported results for the quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $604 million, an increase of 11.5% compared with the year-ago period. Reported operating profit for the quarter was $72.6 million compared with $50 million reported in the year-ago period. In the year-ago period, we took a special charge and incurred temporary manufacturing efficiencies associated with the plant closure as well as a charge for a fraud committed by a freight vendor, which in total reduced operating profit by $16.1 million. I do find it helpful to add back these items to the year-ago period\u2019s results to make them comparable. Doing so, one can see that operating profit for the current quarter compared with the adjusted operating profit in the year-ago period increased approximately 10% while operating profit margin decreased about 20 basis points. Again, remember we are not adjusting the current quarter\u2019s results for the access warranty and foreign currency impact, which lowered both gross profit and operating profit margin by approximately 70 basis points.","Diluted earnings per share for the third quarter were $1.01 while adjusted diluted EPS for the year-ago period was $0.97, an increase of about 4%. Again, our results this quarter were impacted by approximately $0.06 for the two items I previously mentioned -- still very strong results indeed.","The results for the quarter were improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find them even more impressive upon further analysis. While net sales grew 11.5% compared with a year ago, we estimate sales volume grew approximately 13% this quarter. This level of growth is particularly noteworthy given we believe the overall market we serve was up mid-single digits over the year-ago period. Second, the impact of price changes and the mix of products sold as well as foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 1.5%.","Overall, our growth in net sales was broad-based along virtually all major product lines, while certain specialty fixtures more closely associated with new construction continued to lag the overall average due to the still somewhat tepid environment for new, larger non-residential construction projects. Interestingly, orders for these types of products continued to improve suggesting the rebound of our commercial projects in the U.S. is well underway.","From a sales channel perspective, we continued to experience strong growth in the commercial, industrial, and infrastructure channels for both indoor and outdoor applications as well as continued growth for renovation projects. Again, sales of LED based lighting solutions nearly doubled compared with the year-ago period. The sale of LED-based fixtures at Acuity now accounts for more than one third of our total revenues. We believe our level of growth at LED-based lighting solutions is far outpacing the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products further demonstrating our formidable capabilities in product development and our leadership in market access.","Let me again put this in perspective for you. If the sales of our LED-based luminaires were measured as a separate business today, we believe it would easily be the fourth largest lighting company in North America; and remember, it is still only one third of our total business, (inaudible) results indeed.","Overall, we continued to experience growth in most geographies and sales channels in North America, all of which is very encouraging. Excluding LED components, we believe material and component costs were again fairly benign this quarter. With regard to the impact of product pricing and the mix of products sold and net sales, while it is impossible to precisely predict price versus mix, we believe most of the impact was due to the mix of products sold and to a lesser degree the mix of products sold by channels. Market pricing action seemed to be consistent with past practices. Folks we are having a \u2013 I hear a horn go off here, so I apologize, we will continue to go forward, but I apologize for the problem. Let me [indiscernible].","Anyway, looking at our overall market conditions for the third quarter, we believe spending in the U.S. non-residential construction market in which we participate was up low-to-mid-single digits compared with a year ago, while residential construction was up almost 20%. Therefore while complete market data for the quarter is not yet available, we believe the overall lighting market grew in the mid-single digit range during the quarter supported by continued growth in renovation as well as the residential market. This is in stark contrast compared with our net sales growth, which was up almost 12%. Also, we believe there is little, if any, carryover effect this quarter due to the harsh winter conditions which impacted the second quarter.","Lastly, we believe our sales channel product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us again to achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and some key strategic accomplishments in the quarter. Operating profit margin for the third quarter was a solid 12%, down 20 bps compared with adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Again, the access warranty and foreign currency issues I noted earlier reduced the operating profit margin this quarter by approximately 70 basis points.","Our margin strength is particularly noteworthy given that the sales of LED-based lighting solutions are more than a third of our total net sales and we are making investments in new areas of opportunities as I will describe in a moment. Further, as Ricky will discuss later in the call, while gross profit margin declined by 70 basis points to 40.3% from the prior year\u2019s adjusted gross profit margin, the margin decline was primarily due to the abnormal items I noted earlier, and the mix of products sold. This was partially offset by benefits from higher sales volume, productivity gains, and previous restructuring actions. Another area impacting gross profit margin was certain inefficiencies associated with the ramp up of our electronic component capabilities primarily from the acquisition of eldoLAB our programmable LED-driver platform, while it is difficult to predict start up inefficiencies, it is not at all unusual to experience higher cost due to learning [curves] and the inability to absorb cost and to a unit volumes at a more meaningful level.","Overall, we believe these cost reduced our gross profit margin by approximately 20 basis points this quarter. We are significantly accelerating our investment and capabilities to produce electronic components including programmable dimmable drivers for LED lighting applications that require superior functionality and quality, as well as consistent delivery in order to capitalize on this growing market potential.","In addition to the acquisition of eldoLAB itself, we have invested almost $10 million for additional machinery and equipment as well as funding meaningful increases in [solid] and our associates to support our growing internal requirements as well as those of our expanding list of OEM customers for these components. We expect these inefficiencies to impact our margins somewhat over the next few quarters as we ramp up our volumes of these components.","Next, total adjusted selling, distribution and administrative expenses were up almost 10% and a sales increase of approximately 12%. The increase in total SDA expense was due primarily to higher variable cost for commissions and freight to support the growth in net sales, as well as higher employee-related costs, including incentive compensation partially offset by benefits from previously implemented restructuring programs. SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.3% in the quarter compared with adjusted SDA expense of 28.8% in the year-ago period, an improvement of approximately 50 basis points \u2013 all in all, a strong third quarter for Acuity.","On the strategic front, we\u2019ve accomplished a great deal this quarter which will have future benefit. First we continued our rapid pace of introductions of new products, significantly expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions. For example, in May we introduced four new product families of organic LED-based luminaries making us one of the largest sellers of all LED fixtures in the world. As I mentioned earlier, our solid state lighting portfolio continues to expand rapidly, as are the sales of these luminaires, and we continue to fund the development of more holistic lighting and energy saving solutions for specific applications such as schools, healthcare facilities, commercial office buildings, and various outdoor applications to fully leverage our award-winning portfolio of lighting fixtures, controls and components.","As we have noted before, Acuity is a clear leader in digital lighting solutions world. Our expertise lies in the true understanding of the proper use and control of light in the ends vertical applications while minimizing the use of energy. We believe we are without equal in the design and development of fixtures and integrated lighting systems for virtually any indoor and outdoor application without a bias of light source. Our innovation progress was our full display of this years light fair in Las Vegas, a couple of example. Acuity won the highly coveted award, most innovative product of the year for the luminary known as Open introduced under our peerless brand.","Another extraordinary example of our ability to innovate Acuity demonstrated visible like communication technology of light there using Lumicast technology from Qualcomm, Acuity brands smart LED lighting technology roll out retailers to engage with customers and mobile devices based on their location in the store. This system showcases the ability of our commercial available eldoLED driver platform to deliver both illumination and visible like communication providing retailers with an opportunity to significantly increase their sales to customers. This capability will be tested in a proof of concept installation with the major retailer this summer and is unmatched in terms of accuracy and speed. The market potential for this system is enormous adding billions of dollars of potential future growth for Acuity and its partners.","Another area of huge growth potential for Acuity is our electronic components capabilities which are ramping up at a blistering pace. For example, we produced almost 1 million light engine boards in the month of May alone. And industry demand for eldoLED programmable dimming LED driver is growing worldwide as the superior functionality and quality of these products are highly covered by specificiers from our key projects. To put this opportunity in perspective, we believe the market for quality LED drivers could be a billion dollar market within the next 10 or 12 years.","We have been able to produce these robust results because of the dedication and resolve or our more than 6,800 associates to deliver superior value to our customers as well as driving improvements and the efficiency throughout the company to provide superior returns for our shareholders. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the lighting market later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few of our comments regarding our focus through the balance of calendar 2014. Ricky?","Richard K. Reece","Thank you Vern and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll highlight a few items regarding our income statement. I then will discuss our cash flow and financial condition before turning the call back to Vern. Vern covered the primary drivers for our sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items; but I will provide a bit more color on certain aspects of our first quarter results.","Our gross profit margin for our third fiscal quarter of 40.3% decreased 70 basis points compared with the adjusted year-ago period. As Vern mentioned earlier, the benefits of the 11.5% increase in net sales, and an improved productivity were offset by the 70 basis point impact of the additional cost due to the product design issue and unfavorable currency impact.","In addition, gross margins were negative impacted by price mix and the inefficiencies of renting up our electronic component manufacturing capability as Vern discussed earlier. The Company and the U.S. consumer product safety commission announced a recall of certain incandescent emergency lighting fixtures on May 28, 2014. As Vern mentione4d earlier, we\u2019ve recorded during the third quarter $2.1 million of additional cost related to this product design issue which brings the total estimated pre tax expense for this matter to $4.5 million. The additional estimated cost recorded this period is primarily due to the highest revised estimates related to the product cost and labor to properly handle this issue. While it is possible that there could be additional cost associated with the ultimate resolution of this issue, we do not currently believe they will be material and the amount recorded is our best estimate of the total cost based on what we currently know.","The unfavorable currency impact was primarily due to the Canadian dollar which weakened by 7% year-over-year relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result, we experienced approximately $2.1 million negative impact on our gross profits. We, as well as certain other industry participants have announced price increases in Canada which should help to dampen this impact going forward. In addition, the Canadian dollar has recently experienced a modest appreciation. ","The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 32.2% compared with 29.9% in the third quarter of last year. Both periods were favorably impacted by a reduction and a certain income tax reserves. We estimate the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 will be approximately 35.5% before any discrete items, and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the remainder of the year.","Cash flow generated from operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2014 was an impressive $128.8 million compared with $67.8 million in the prior year period. This significant year-over-year improvement reflects higher net income, and lower working capital requirement as compared with the prior year period.","In the first nine months of fiscal year 2014, we spent $24.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $31.4 million in the prior year period. We currently expect to spend approximately $45 million in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2014.","At May 31, 2014, we had a cash balance of $467.3 million, an increase of $108.2 million since the beginning of the fiscal year. Our total debt was $354 million; consequently, our cash exceeded debt at the end of the first quarter. At May 31, 2014, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.8 million under our credit facility that does not mature until January 2017, so we continue to maintain a significant amount of financial flexibility.","Thank you, and I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities. With regard to our expectation for the balance of calendar 2014, our view has not changed. We remain very positive. So while we don\u2019t give earnings guidance, I would like to reiterate what we\u2019ve previously mentioned regarding our expectations for the rest of 2014.","First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest but increasing pace. Our forecast for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate is the broad lighting market in North America is expected to grow in the mid to upper single digit range for the rest of 2014 and accelerating into 2015 reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Further, we continue to see other signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business.","Leading indicators in the North American market such as the Architectural Building Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability, and the rebound in residential construction continued to improve. As has become the norm over the last handful of years, we are always leery of the next round of uncertainty that might come out of Washington regarding fiscal issues as well as foreign policy. As you know, the manner and how these key issues are handled can meaningfully influence business and consumer confidence.","Nonetheless, we continue to expect that the overall demand in our end markets for the balance of calendar 2014 will continue to improve and be more broad-based and consistent than experienced in 2013. The continued favorable trend in our June order rate again seems to support this continuing level of improvement.","Second, excluding certain LED components which are expected to continue to experience price declines we do not anticipate significant changes in input costs for the balance of our 2014 as some commodity costs have waned while others continue to rise. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise due to wage inflation, the negative impact of rising healthcare costs, and higher incentive compensation due to our positive performance. Of course, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture as well as furthering our efforts to drive productivity improvements to help offset rising costs, as evidenced by the benefits realized in fiscal year 2014 from streamlining actions we took in the second half of fiscal 2013.","Next, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume as well as product and sales channel mix, we expect our gross profit margin to improve over time as volume grows, particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix, and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies. Well as we noted earlier, we expect margins to be somewhat constraint over the next few quarters until we achieve improvements in volumes and \u2013 inefficiencies in our electronic components capabilities. Also we expect margins over the longer term to benefit from the sale of higher value-added integrated lighting solutions with differentiated features and benefits.","Additionally, while we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and sales channels such as home improvement, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the introduction of holistic lighting solutions that are connecting smart lighting with our smart phones for retailers as well as our growing electronic component capabilities. As we have noted in our last several conference calls, our strategies to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same. We continue to see opportunities in this environment, including benefits from growing portions of the market, further expansion in under-penetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the introduction of new lighting solutions. Our positive results reflect the solid execution of these strategies by our associates.","Our company-wide strategy is straightforward \u2013 expand and leverage our industry-leading portfolio and solutions, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength, to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns.","This of course all takes focus and resources. We are funding these activities today because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market our record growth supports this view. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential. As the North American market leader, we are positioned well to full participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you, and with that we will entertain any questions that you have. And the great news is that the fire drill is now over, so we can actually hear you, hopefully you can hear us.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). The first question is from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Thanks, good morning.","Richard K. Reece","Good morning.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","The Fire drill wasn\u2019t so bad on our end.","Richard K. Reece","It was pretty bad, and that\u2019s it.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","I bet. Just wondering what your view is on how much cash is needed to run the business, and you know what outlets you are seeing for using some of the excess cash?","Richard K. Reece","Yeah, Chris, as far a normal working capital needs in the $50 million to $75 million, generally will support our ongoing working capital fluctuations and capital spending ebbs and flows, so as you can tell, we do have quite a bit of dry powder in the cash that we have. Consistent with previous comments, our first priority is to invest in the business in organic growth and then second would be acquisitions, and we do see quite a bit of opportunity on the M&A side, and we\u2019ll continue to look at that and then absent that, we certainly have used our excess cash to repurchase shares as well as continuing to pay our standard dividend.","Vernon J. Nagel","Chris, we expect to continue to generate very very solid cash flow growth. As Ricky pointed out, it takes us about $0.10 or $0.11 of operating working capital to support every dollar of increase, and we are working our inventories back down to more normal levels as we learn how to manage both LED luminaires and the production of conventional luminaires. I think on the CapEx side, Ricky, we\u2019re between 1.5% and 2% of revenues. We will be probably investing a little bit more next year in terms of building out just the ability to house our growing staff. And as we go from $2 billion to $4 billion and $5 billion of revenues, we will drive productivity throughout the business, but it\u2019s pretty obvious that we\u2019ll be growing our salaried head count, and so frankly, we\u2019re out of capacity, so we are looking at ways to resolve that. But we still should be able to operate reasonably well within that 1.5% to 2% of sales from our capital investment perspective.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay. Thanks for that. And on the acquisition pipeline, that\u2019s \u2013 is there a good range in breadth of different size type deals?","Vernon J. Nagel","","I would say that there is, I mean again as we\u2019ve pointed out, we are looking for really three capabilities, one to enhance our technology capability, number two to enhance the product portfolio capability maybe from a design perspective. We\u2019re also looking at the opportunities for geography expansions, and as you know, we look to continue to build out our residential platform. So from \u2013 there\u2019s nothing out there where it\u2019s a must have, but the opportunity for items and acquisitions that can help accelerate our capabilities in these areas, Ricky and his team are very, very busy. In the range of sizes, it\u2019s interesting from very small, take Adura for example, a few items that are larger but when we say larger, we are talking hundreds of millions of dollars; we are not talking merely larger than that.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Great, thanks for that color. And then just a housekeeping, the 35.5% tax rate for the year, I think that sort of implies a record high in the upper 30s in the fourth quarter, is that appropriate?","Richard K. Reece","Might be not quite that high, it again depends on any changes, but it will probably be a little less than that, probably closer to that 35.5% to 36% for the full quarter.","Christopher Glynn \u2013 Oppenheimer","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson","Hi, good morning. On the price mix headwind, does that reflect a specific channel, a change in markets within non-res that you are serving or kind of a change in the broader product portfolio?","Vernon J. Nagel","No, Brent, it was interesting this quarter. We were hopeful if you will for a more rich mix of products sold, absolutely impossible to predict the way the mix plays out, but when we look at it, it really was certain products migrating, just simply products moving from one type to another and more in our conventional light source products, it was just interesting to us. I believe that this product mix shift that we experienced this quarter is more of a temporary activity again impossible to predict. When we look at mix over the full 12 months, I think that that will be a more representative mix, if you will. And to us, we still fluctuate between channels, different channels have different margin profiles, but they also have different if you will return on investment profiles. So when we looked at the mix this quarter, and when we passed all the noise, I mean the way I\u2019d looked at it, our adjusted gross profit margins were 41.2%, and that\u2019s kind of getting us in the range. If the mix had been a little bit more traditional around the product side, we would have enjoyed even a higher margin expectation. So, we\u2019ll just have to wait to see.","When we are in that 41% to 42% gross profit range where we are today, we feel that we\u2019re hitting our stride. We have to get past -- we\u2019ve gotten past we believe the warranty issue. FX, there\u2019s not really a lot that we can do to forecast that, and we are ramping up our capabilities in the electronic components space, which will provide us with several things; one, features and benefits that are of a very high quality if you have a electronic component capability, assured delivery and ultimately we believe a significant cost advantage. So, all of these things that were kind of impacting this quarter, our expectation is that though it will either go away or that will yield future benefits as we go forward.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson","Okay. And then just second when you look at kind of the entire construction you know retrofit in market landscape, are there specific sectors in the market that you are choosing to avoid because it doesn\u2019t meet your parameters for margin returns maybe it\u2019s too crowded or the opportunity for product per square footage isn\u2019t as appealing.","Vernon J. Nagel","Well when we look the way we attack if you will the renovation markets we have a number of sales forces, we have a number of channel partners. So what we are looking to do is to support them in their focus to their end customer base. And given our size and scale and the way we \u2013 the product portfolio that we have there really aren\u2019t too many areas of opportunity that we won\u2019t explore or aggressively go after. Obviously much of our business is a bid business, there are at times folks that will bid projects at price points that we don\u2019t feel are really prudent. So we\u2019ll either not play or we\u2019ll work hard to differentiate our portfolio in a different way. So I would say the answer to your question is no, there\u2019s no one or two areas that we would deploy but we look to aggressively go after business opportunities and then use our sourcing capabilities and the great strength of our many associates to drive cost out to make it a profitable venture for our shareholders.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs","Thomas Daniels \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hi, guys, this is Tom Daniels on for Brian. Thanks for taking my question. First, you know maybe for Vern, I was wondering if you could kind of dive into a little bit of the market share gains clearly for many quarters here you guys are outpacing the overall market and your LED lighting sales are significantly outpacing competitors. And my question is you know as the lighting gets more and more kind of technologically improved, is this a long term market share gain for Acuity and do you think the dynamics in the offshore market can change pretty meaningfully over the next decade as LEDs become such important part of the portfolio?","Vernon J. Nagel","We do see opportunities to take advantage of what technology means coming into our space. For us LED and the notion of solid state lighting is really an enabler for future opportunity. Again, you saw that in our press release, we commented on the notion of visible light communication technology. This is really in conjunction with Qualcomm and Lumicast our opportunity to deliver to the retailing space just as an example a value proposition that is not just about quality of light and energy savings, represents a huge potential market for Acuity and in our partners to really drive that kind of value. So when we think about the investments that we are making today in terms of eldoLED, in terms of our electronic component capability, it\u2019s really so that we can bring more value to those end applications. Our view around the market place continues to evolve. So, we call this a tiered approach to lighting solutions.","If you imagine in the first year, it\u2019s for simply product features and benefits price points. But then you start to migrate along peers where you are able to add more capability into a more holistic solution, we think that that brings even more value through its healthcare facilities, commercial office buildings, industrial spaces, outdoor and by doing so it really changes if you will to paradigm shift between just providing light into its space that now providing of light and other information that can come of off these LED luminaires which are really also communication devices. So for Acuity, we see the opportunity to significantly expand our addressable market since the acquisitions that we\u2019ve made of companies like Renaissance and Adura and eldoLED Pathway Horizon these are all creating a capability within our portfolio to provide intelligent, holistic lighting solutions to these applications in a way that they have never had before.","So you couple our supply chain with our great technologist and our access to market, I do think that it gives Acuity the opportunity to participate more meaningfully in a very rapidly growing market place over the next decade and beyond.","Thomas Daniels \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Thanks for that color, Vern, appreciate it. Just my one other follow up, can you remind us in prior cycles as we start seeing on res construction I noted lackluster today, as we start seeing those construction numbers improve is there a lag effect for when Acuity actually starts seeing the unit volumes increase, I thought it might to six to twelve months, but just wondering if you could comment on that? Thanks.","Vernon J. Nagel","Ricky, we do have some pretty good data that shows going back to the kind of middle [age] is that cycle and how this cycle works maybe you want to comment a little bit on it.","Richard K. Reece","Yeah, clearly there is a cycle around the specification when a building, it\u2019s designed and in the specification it\u2019s got to come out of the ground, you got to get tenants in it and lighting is one of the last things to come in. And you\u2019re right, it tends to be six or twelve months we use nine months as kind of an average on many other construction put in place type of data that we look at, if you look at the architectural building index, the lag is even longer, cause there you are actually just designing it. But there is our construction cycle lag, I would say is renovation becomes a bigger part of our total mix, now roughly half of our mix there the lag is much less, typically in a renovation situation once they decide to renovate it can move quickly, on other times though they all want to do an audit and study it for a year or longer so that six to twelve months is a broad range of what I would think is reasonable lag to most of the major indicators that you would see out there.","Vernon J. Nagel ","And Tom, just to add to Ricky\u2019s comment, we know that on an inflation adjusted basis in the U.S. non-residential construction is off 25% from it\u2019s peak and yet Acuity this year will that\u2019s the number the analyst all have $2.4 billion of revenue. We are 20% above in terms of total revenues where we were at the peak in 2008. And to Ricky\u2019s point, it\u2019s because we\u2019ve really diversified the end markets that we serve and we are not as directly tied to new construction because of the expansion of our product portfolio and how we have altered our access to market to participate more wholesomely and the renovation work.","Thomas Daniels \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That makes a lot of sense. Thank you very much guys.","Operator","The next question is from Matt McCall from BB&T.","Matt McCall - BB&T Capital Markets","Good morning, guys. So on the electronic components investment, Vernon you mentioned two things. You mentioned the $1 billion market opportunity and then you mentioned the cost advantage. Can you, is it more of a cost advantage to kind of vertically integrate that or is it more of a revenue opportunity and then how do we \u2013 how would you recommend that we model that billion dollar market potential over the next so many years.","Vernon J. Nagel","So Matt, our investment in eldoLED was really made because we saw the opportunity of eldoLEDs superior functionality and the quality of the driver. Their ability to dim the dark in unmatched in the industry today. And so, as LED continues to portrait and of course it will, we felt strongly that having the ability to have a superior LED driver that\u2019s programmable and then expand its portfolio so that it has also cost features and benefits and in a tiered sort of capability was going to be very valuable to Acuity. We also felt that the opportunity available led more of an industry standard. We are making eldoLED available to the industry, so all those this is a trending strategy, so others have access to the eldoLED capability for their designs and their products. So our view was that this is a great capability. You saw from the announcement and that [indiscernible] you had liked there but you saw that the Lumicast technology of that lead introduced in conjunction with Qualcomm, and light there is really enhanced because of eldoLEDs internal capabilities to do so many things and do those so well.","So the Lumicast technology that\u2019s being made available and will be tested here shortly provides a superior mobile device retailing experience with accuracy and speed that\u2019s unmatched by others that have potentially for claiming potentially similar type programs. So eldoLED was a growth strategy and now as we look at it the opportunity for us to continue to drive cost and to give cost and our OEM customers a cost advantage is there. We certainly won\u2019t make every LED driver, we will have a broad supply chain as we do, but this is a capability that allows us in our tiered solution approach to offer more features and benefits that have great quality.","Matt McCall - BB&T Capital Markets","Okay. That\u2019s helpful, thanks Vernon. And then my other question. You talked about variable comp, freight expenses, higher employee cost as being or increasing your SG&A is \u2013 does the math change there you talked about that $95 million of fixed cost and then the variable component varying at about 11.5% rate with sales. Is that still the right number to use, do we expect and then CapEx is projected to increase a little bit in Q4, is there going to be some more seasonality with it, some more investment that\u2019s going to take that higher, how do we look at OpEx as over the near end and out in the next year?","Vernon J. Nagel","So Matt, let me be clear, was that one question or 50?","Matt McCall - BB&T Capital Markets","One question with many parts, thank you.","Vernon J. Nagel","Okay, let me start and I\u2019ll start a little bit. This particular quarter, our freight commissions expand were slightly higher than what we would normally expect to probably 30 bips higher. Usually we are in that 11.5% to 11.6% of total revenues; again we were 30 bips higher. I think that that was a little bit of an abnormality so we would expect overtime that to find it\u2019s average again, 11.5% to 11.6%. When it comes to the fixed cost and obviously it\u2019s not completely fixed because we have incentive compensation and other items that are somewhat like that in there, our view is that we are increasing that fixed base and again, I want to be very clear about this. We are investing in things like eldoLED; we are investing in capabilities like partnering with Qualcomm and Lumicast. These are outside of if you will to traditional or historical businesses that Acuity was focused on. And the reason we are doing is because again we see great future potential that really is expanding what we would consider our addressable market and the future opportunities that are out there. How quickly some of those were rolled in, you know time will tell and we\u2019ll provide more information as we know more information. But we see such huge potential we want to continue and invest. So that brings me all the way back then to your question around fixed, sort of that fixed piece.","We were averaging about $95 per quarter. My guess is that you\u2019ll see \u2013 you ought to see that ramp up. I think this quarter were close to $100 million, $99.3 million sort of exact numbers. My guess is that based on our headcount, we\u2019ve added about 50 to 60 folks here over the last quarter and a half, we are going to continue to invest to get up to some of these other areas. So it wouldn\u2019t surprise me if that number you know migrates to kind of the 105 range. What I really like as a way for your models you know if you look at our total headcount, we are now sitting with about 2100 and 60 salaried folks. In total we have about 6800 people. But on average to deliver the consensus top line number which I don\u2019t have in front of me, but saves 2.4 billion what you will see is that Acuity is continuing to drive headcount productivity and when we look a the salaries we are also driving salary productivity. So the growth is there and it\u2019s happening. But we are investing outside of if you will out traditional business because we see potential there.","Let me add a bit of comment here and I think this will help you. You know we look at our variable contributions, that they fluctuate and it\u2019s difficult to precisely predict because of mix and some of the investments that we are making exactly what is going to happen. But let me give you all an example. If I compare the third quarter to our previous second quarter and I take away the noise around FX and around the warranty issue and I adjust for a little bit of the inefficiencies as we ramp up the components business, when I look at that change in top line and I look at the variable contribution after that, we were roughly 24% variable contribution. So I feel like we are delivering in a good range while continuing to invest in the business. Now it\u2019s unfortunate that we have a little bit of this noise around the abnormality \u2013 warranty and FX but those will go away and you will continue to see I think a reasonable contribution coming off those incremental sales, which is important for both your models and your returns.","Lastly, I would point out that if you look at our cash flow return on investment on a trailing four quarters, we are now at 27% cash flow return on investment and that\u2019s pretty extraordinary for a manufacturing company.","Matt McCall - BB&T Capital Markets","All right, thank you Vernon very helpful.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","The next question is from Mike Ritzenthaler from Piper Jaffray","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Yes, good morning. My first question is a follow up to a previous one on the pockets of strength within C&I, particularly as it relates to public sector projects. I was curious if its accelerated bidding activity generally speaking there and can you remind us of the relative importance of public projects in Acuity C&I portfolio?","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes, you know from a bid perspective and I won\u2019t single out just public sector bids, but if I look at our overall quoting activity, quoting activity continues to be up nicely and obviously our bid rates continues to improve and see a notion of market share gains. When we look at the end markets, our roadway business continues to be very strong and that was building out the portfolio three and four years ago that really altered the competitiveness and I think we had meaningfully gained share and we were loosing share for a while there because we were slower on the uptake within the LED world and that no longer is true. Acuity is again leading not only from a technology perspective but we are the largest outdoor lighting manufacturer company in North America. When we look at schools and that type of works, yes it\u2019s the budgets in many of these states and these local municipalities continue to improve. We are starting to see an improvement in what\u2019s happening in schools but lets be clear, schools is still a fairly soft market based on historical standards. And we truly believe that there is a lot of pent up demand because populations continue to grow at roughly at 2% per annum and yet schools have probably had a three year hiatus in terms of their developments.","So eventually that breaks. Roadway, there\u2019s a lot of again opportunity as people continue to look at the benefits of LED luminaires versus particularly as we introduce controls into those LED luminaires that can do many more things other than just monitor the luminair.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","Got it. Excellent, thanks for that. And then a follow up question on the warranty issue and whether the current situation with the emergency signs will change or modify in some way the normal accounting mechanics going forward of the percent of sales reserve for warranty or if it\u2019s kind of a temporary blip?","Vernon J. Nagel","Ricky, this particular incidence would not adjust necessary our process of accruing for warranty because this is a recall situation which thankfully is extremely rare for us to experience some thing like that. But we have you know continued to adjust our normal warranty accrual based on the typical experience that we have and with the newer technologies in the broader portfolio we have been monitoring that very closely and have seen a modest increase in the percentage of our normal warranty accrual as a result of the more solid state and the longer periods of warranty five years for example that we typically would offer for an LED warranty versus a shorter period that was normal or incandescent plus now we would trend more of that warranty than we did in the past. So a modest increase, nothing significant but we are monitoring that closely and making the appropriate adjustments in our accrual processes.","Mike Ritzenthaler - Piper Jaffray","That makes sense. Thanks guys.","Operator","The next question is from Tim Weiss from Baird.","Tim Weiss \u2013 Robert W. Baird","","Yeah good morning guys. I guess just on the mid-to-high single digit market growth that you guys talked about, what do you think gets the market to the lower end and the upper end of that range?","Vernon J. Nagel","So for us we are not economist, but what we do is we try to triangulate amongst the whole bunch of data points. We use [NEMA] we look at what their prognostications, so they are pretty consistent around the growth of the lively market. We look at all of the other industries that I had mentioned whether it\u2019s ABI, a whole notion of absorption, population growth that\u2019s happening with for example rental rates on and so forth. And a lot of these signs continue to flash nice green, there is not a lot of yellow out there, so I believe that given how long we have and in the sort of doldrums of non-residential construction it makes sense to us that this cycle begins to build on. And so I won\u2019t be political here, but this recovery has been the slowest recovery on record. So it\u2019s not \u2013 this is not abnormal to see this type of generation flow into certain markets around the country and you see that space has been well absorbed so now they are into the new construction phase out in California. Northern California for example you know two years ago there were few cranes in San Francisco today there are many. Same thing is true to the northeast. So all of these signs are giving us I think a positive feeling that the trend that we have prognosticated is alive and well. I believe that as business conditions continue to improve we actually can see a shortage of certain types of real estate and so therefore it will attract capital, it will then create investments and will spur us on.","As Ricky pointed our earlier the renovation world for us is a huge market. It\u2019s we\u2019d estimate north of $300 billion installed base 70% of which was put in place before 1990 converting very slowly. So how folks get after this market as that market will also I think slice this too and we expect that renovation will continue for quite a long time to be a meaningful part of our business or then say it was in 2008.","Tim Weiss \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And I guess you raised the market outlook last quarter, is there anything over the last three to four months that you have seen just talking with people by [fair] and some of your agents that gives you more confidence in that range relative to last quarter and as you look into 2015?","Vernon J. Nagel","I believe that there is a \u2013 there\u2019s enthusiasm for the broad market in general so you could talk to any of my competitors or other industry participants and I think they would tell you that broad electrical industry and then more narrowly define the lighting industry will be a very solid place to play over the next decade particularly as more technology comes into place. But when we look at Acuity, we get quite excited about our future and our future meaning our long term future because we see the opportunity not only to provide discrete products which we are good at, but also now the opportunity to provide varying levels of holistic lighting solutions that incorporate not only the Luminary itself but now sensing technology, control technology so folks can do so much more with that solution. Again, we are very excited about the whole notion of how we are delivering sort of our visible light communication technology in partnership with Qualcomm. We think that these retailers will be very excited to not only have quality of life, tremendous energy savings, but its an additional revenue source so we are very excited to continue to invest in ways that where technology is an enabler to us to expand our adjustable market.","It wouldn\u2019t surprise me that if over the next 12 months we redefine our addressable market to be much larger than what it is today.","Tim Weiss \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Colin Rusch from Northland Capital Markets, your line is open.","Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets","Thanks so much. So just following up on that point about the addressable market, obviously if you got these control systems in place is a significant software or a software as a service opportunity for you guys to potentially address, can you talk a little bit about you know the direction of these partnerships are going you know the part of this question. And the second part, you mentioned the 24% return on invested capital you\u2019ve been very I think disciplined as investors over the course of the years. Could you talk about expectations for return on investment with these partnerships?","Vernon J. Nagel","These relationships that we have, we have been working on for really sometime and they come in all forms. We have strong relationships with our supply base, and so how we work with suppliers, some of whom are even competitors, but how we work with those folks to bring value has always been one of the hallmarks of Acuity and really understanding the end market and then being able to bring the best players to really solve that problem I think that is a great skill that we have. As solid state or electronics come into our world, it\u2019s allowing us really to take a blank sheet of paper and think very differently. It\u2019s almost a world of apple, how do you bring apps, how do you take advantage of what technology is allowing you to do. What\u2019s truly amazing here is if you take eldoLED which is a programmable dimmable driver that provides really no stroboscopic effects on luminaires. Some of our competitors and other component suppliers actually can\u2019t make that claim. It allows us to provide quality of light into its space, but also now be a communication device and a clean communication device.","So to us, this is fantastically interesting. So -- we can do many things, we certainly can\u2019t do everything so we are in conversations with many folks, not only suppliers but also potential other access points to market channels if you will that we have never really traditionally talked to before, now we are able to bring I think a very differentiated capability. Every building and every street need to have a light of some type. It\u2019s now a communication device. So how we take advantage of providing superior quality of life, energy savings and now other potential revenue streams from that communication device is a unique capability. Our luminaires now have sensing devices in them, comes from one of our acquisitions that we made about four years ago Ricky was with Renaissance. So all of these pieces in parts are now really starting to come together in a way that will allow us to provide tiered solutions to folks in these end applications as they warrant and it\u2019s opening up a whole new world for us in terms of who should we align with and how and generally speaking you are getting the best players coming together. There are other folks that are out there offering some type of mobile device into the retail space; we believe very strongly that when the market really sees the combination of Qualcomm\u2019s Lumicast technology with our superior lighting we have really a very very robust offering that would be hard to match.","Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets","Okay and then just changing gears a little bit. Just talk about two things, one, any change in geography in terms of end market go through within the U.S. just on a regional basis? And then if you could comment on opportunities in agricultural light space, what you are seeing there at this point?","Vernon J. Nagel","I would say from a geographical perspective we are starting to see nice growth in those markets that have LED certainly but technology and\/or pick the west coast, San Francisco you\u2019ve got LA moving up. You take the east coast, where you\u2019ve Boston, and Washington still, all of these markets are starting to improve where job growth is occurring you are seeing nice construction activities. So I would say that from a geographical perspective we are seeing a reasonably broad based approach. We look in some of these markets where they have for shale gas and in opportunities they are on fire, I mean, because they are growing so rapidly. So where there is share growth there is opportunity, where there is political sort of intrusion or intervention, you see slower growth. Ricky.","Richard K. Reece","I would agree. Certainly seeing it in those areas where the employment is taken up which is one of the big drivers. On the agricultural question, that is not a market that is a strategic focus for that, you are seeing that a pick up for certain niche players in that markets but it has not been a strategic focus for us to participate in that agricultural growth type lighting.","Colin Rusch - Northland Capital Markets","Okay. Thanks a lot guys.","Operator","The final question comes from Winnie Clark from UBS","Winnie Clark - UBS","Good morning thanks for taking my question. I wanted to talk about mix a little bit more. You have seeing better trends in higher margin products over the last couple of quarters from an order perspective. It sounds like you thought you might have benefited from it a little bit more in 3Q, would you expect these orders to start driving and improving in the mix dynamic next quarter, is that likely to be something you see in \u201915?","Vernon J. Nagel","So it\u2019s hard to predict what next quarter looks like. We\u2019ve seen our June order rates and so we\u2019re favorably inclined and hence we made the comment that we think that again our order rate for the month after the quarter continues to reflect sort of the growth trend. But yes, I think as we go into 2015 our expectation is that our margin should gradually improve as we continue to sell what we call more tiered solutions. As we migrate down the value add curve, where it\u2019s not just a single product type competing features and benefits and price is more about how does the whole system work and what are the benefits that come off of that. We believe that that will yield a higher and a more rich mix and therefore margin. With regard to the fourth quarter, we don\u2019t really prognosticate but I think this quarter for us was just a little bit \u2013 it\u2019s the way the mix flowed in terms of some of the projects that we had I would expect that as we continue to see volume growth and as we continue to do cost outs, as we continue to probe these markets on these various solutions our expectation is that our mix will continue to evolve in a more favorable way.","I can say when I do the puts and takes, I kind of do a back of an envelope, sort of calc, and our margins gross profit margins were 41.2% for this quarter. Again, improvement particularly improvement over the second quarter on an apples-to-apples basis and so I would hope that that trend continues and that the headwin that we faced this quarter from a mix perspective does abate somewhat. And the other point that I made earlier is our freight cost and our commission cost at combination was a little bit higher than what we typically have experienced and hoped we would see a little bit of regression act of \u2013 for more among that as well.","Winnie Clark - UBS","","Okay. Thank you. Last quarter while you noted it was hard to quantify you thought whether it could have been as much as a 3% headwin I think you said you don\u2019t think you saw any weather catch up in the current quarter. Is that something you still think you could recapture you know during the peak season?","Vernon J. Nagel","It\u2019s a great question. Interesting to us we all speculated is it would be something that we would [recoup] and I think you saw lots of industrial companies come out afterwards and make commentarial round how the weather impacted their business. We did not see in the channels that we particularly watch a rebound and we try to watch certain projects and those projects simply just played out the way they were going to play out. So we don\u2019t really think that there was any meaningful impact and certainly there was an order here or there that flowed through and it was accelerated trying to benefit or meet time deadline. But in this case generally speaking we just feel that we recaptured any of that nor do I think that we\u2019re bound to recapture. I think that everyone\u2019s adjusted their construction cycles and they are just simply moving forward.","Winnie Clark - UBS","","Great. Thank you.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you everyone for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies, and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the longer term deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","That concludes today\u2019s conference. Please disconnect at this time."],"484":["Acuity Brands, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you. Good morning.","With me -- excuse me, with me today to discuss our fiscal 2015 first quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call on our website at acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risk and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we'll be happy to answer your questions.","First off our results for the first quarter of 2015 were just outstanding. Our net sales grew almost 13%, while our adjusted earnings per share grew nearly 40%. On an adjusted basis, we achieved quarterly records for operating profit, operating profit margin, net income and earnings per share.","In fact, this was the seventh quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth. We believe these results are yet again strong evidence of our strategies to provide our customers with differentiated, value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position in North America.","These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy efficient lighting solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity.","Our adjusted profitability for the quarter was a record for Acuity, even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth and areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and lighting controls portfolio.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights, for the quarter.","Net sales for the first quarter were $647 million, an increase of almost 13% compared with the year-ago period and the second highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the first quarter of 2015 was $86.7 million compared with reported operating profit of $77.4 million in the year-ago period.","This quarter we recorded a special pretax charge of $10 million associated with certain streamlining actions to lower our cost structure and to reduce spending in certain areas, so we can increase investment in new opportunities with greater growth, with greater potential for future profitable growth.","Also in the year-ago quarter, we received $5 million as a partial recovery for a fraud perpetrated by our former freight service provider to the company, for which we had previously recognized an expense in the third quarter of 2013.","I find it helpful to add back these items to both quarter results to make them comparable. In doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the first quarter of 2015 was a quarterly record of $96.7 million, compared with adjusted operating profit of $72.4 million in the year-ago period.","Adjusted operating profit margin for this quarter was a robust 14.9%, up 230 basis points from adjusted margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a record $1.32, compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.96 in the year-ago period, up 38%, strong quarterly results indeed.","In addition, we generated almost $47 million in net cash provided by operating activities this quarter. As Ricky will discuss later, we meaningfully enhanced our already strong financial position this quarter as we now have more than $580 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, far exceeding our debt of slightly more than $350 million.","These results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period we believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis.","While net sales for the first quarter grew almost 13% compared with the year-ago period, we estimate our sales volume grew more than 14%. This growth was partially offset by lower price mix and to a lesser degree of the impact of foreign currency.","While it's not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on like-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline of certain LED components and to a lesser degree of changes in the mix of products sold.","The increase in net sales was broad based along most product lines, including certain specialty fixtures as well as certain control solutions, more closely associated with new construction as this important market continues to expand.","From a channel perspective, we continue to experience strong growth in commercial, industrial and infrastructure as well as games and home improvement.","Our sales growth this quarter was primarily due to our continued focus on projects for new construction and renovation in both the non-residential and residential markets as well as continued emphasis on selling higher value-add lighting solutions especially LED luminaires, where sales of our LED products grew by almost 75% this quarter, compared to the year-ago period, an extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for more than 40% of our total net sales.","We believe our rate of growth for LED luminaires continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products demonstrating our leading -- market-leading prowess.","Excluding LED luminaires and components, we believe the put and takes for product pricing as well as material and component cost were again fairly benign this quarter. looking at market conditions for the first quarter, we believe that North American lighting market was up mid single digits during the quarter. This was in contrast with the growth rates of our net sales in North America, which was up more than 14%.","Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted first quarter operating profit was $96.7 million, the most in our history and adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a robust 14.9%, also the highest in our history, up 230 basis points from adjusted margin in the year-ago period.","Our gross profit for the quarter was 42.2%, up 90 basis points compared with the year-ago quarter. The expansion our gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher sales volume, somewhat offset by price mix and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.","Productivity improvements and lower material cost also had a small, yet favorable impact on our gross profit margin improvement this quarter.","Next, total selling distribution and administrative expenses excluding the items noted earlier for each quarter were up $11.6 million, or 7%, on the net sales increase of almost 13%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.2% in the quarter, a decrease of 150 basis points from the year-ago period.","The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission cost to support the increase in net sales and to a lesser degree, higher compensation cost. The improvement in adjusted SD&A expense as a percentage of net sales was primarily due to the benefit of higher sales volume, cost containment programs in certain areas and timing of certain programs and of course productivity gains.","This next point is very important, another way to view just how robust our first quarter results were as to examine our variable contribution margin or adjusted operating profit on the increase in net sales.","Doing so, one can see our variable contribution on the incremental sales of $73 million was almost 34%. All in all we had another great quarter.","On the strategic front, we continue to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be a strong growth and profitability in 2015 and beyond. During the quarter we took certain actions to further streamline our organization that will lower our cost structure and better allocate resources and investments to areas with greater potential future profitable growth.","These actions included the rationalization of certain production activities as well as the elimination of certain positions with the intent of adding new positions to pursue opportunities, which require experience and skills different from those we possess today.","From a product and lighting solutions development perspective, we continued our rapid pace of new product introductions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solution.","As we've noted in the past, we offer customers more than $1.7 million skews to choose from, more than three times as many as we had in 2008. No other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands.","Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our lighting controls and solid state lighting product offering. For the first quarter, our LED sales grew approximately 75% compared with the year-ago period.","This is essentially the first quarter in four years where our growth in LED fixtures did not at least double compared with the year-ago period. This is an extraordinary achievement when you again consider that if one would imagine the sales of our LED products as a standalone company.","We believe that would be the fourth largest lighting luminaire company in North America, while we believe our conventional business would still be number one.","Additionally, we continue the development of luminaires and corporate and other light source technologies such as organic LEDs where we continue to expand our award-winning portfolio of these innovative products.","The strength of our portfolio is so significant we're evolving to an integrated tiered solutions approach, which fully leverages the benefits of our product development capabilities with the integration of our many acquisitions, including our controls portfolio.","The purpose of this strategy is to leverage this incredibly diverse portfolio by offering customer solutions that best meet their needs, whether it be a single device or a complete holistic integrated lighting solution for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise and security from Acuity that you're in good hands and we have your back. This will be a compelling and powerful value proposition for customers.","While we execute this strategy, we've continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer centric, leveraging our industry leading access to market and to better allocate resources along each of our tiers, creating the best solution for our customer's applications.","More impressively, our adjusted operating profit margin continue to expand this quarter, while sales of LED-based solutions have become an even larger portion of our overall business.","Acuity is a clear leader of providing customers with superior lighting solutions, incorporating either convention or solid state light sources. The market has come to understand that LED as a light source is no longer new, now widely accepted the attention of customers as focused on how one best can control and utilize this light source to optimize our visual environment, while realizing additional benefits including its long life and energy savings characteristics.","Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of LED to optimize the visual environment and provide other benefits including significant energy savings to our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application. We believe we're growing significantly faster than the markets we serve.","At Acuity, we view the advent of LED as an enabler, affording us the opportunity to bring differentiated lighting solutions to a broad array of customers distancing us from our competitors.","Our expertise lies in the true understanding of the proper use and control of light, while minimizing the use of energy. We are without equal in the design and development of fixtures and integrated lighting systems for virtually any application without a bias of the light source.","As I've noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during areas of technology disruption and that is even more true today.","Acuity Brands is leading the evolution to intelligent lighting solutions with its broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor solid-state and traditional energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls. And we're delivering profitable growth and strong financial returns for our shareholders while making these important investments. ","These accomplishments have diversified and strengthened our foundation and will further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new commercial construction cycle.","We've enabled to produce these results because of the dedication resolving for more than 7,000 associates who are manically focused on serving, solving, and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2015. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone.","Vern covered the primary drivers for our fourth quarter sales growth and our profitability. So I'll not repeat these items, other than to echo Vern's comment that they were truly outstanding. I\u2019ll begin my prepared comment by discussing the special charge we took in the first quarter of 2015.","We've recorded a pretax special charge of $10 million or $0.15 diluted EPS, associated with the actions to streamline the organization by realigning certain responsibilities primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments as well as for the consolidation of certain production activities.","The special charge consisted primarily of severance and employee related cost. We currently expect to incur production transfer expense and additional cost associated with these streamlining actions totaling approximately $1 million during the next two fiscal quarters.","We expect to achieve annual savings in excess of these costs, but as Vern mentioned earlier, we plan to reinvest a portion of these savings in additional growth initiatives, which will require adding new talent with different skill sets.","Accordingly in fiscal year 2015, we expect to realize savings net of reinvestments approximately equal to the amount of the total restructuring cost. These net savings are expected to be realized later in this year primarily in the fourth quarter.","And other expense income we reported net miscellaneous income of $0.9 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 compared with net miscellaneous expense $0.6 million for the same period last year. This favorable comparison of $1.5 million pre tax is due to changes in foreign currency rates.","The effective tax rate for the first quarter was 35.9% compared with 35.3% in the first quarter of last year. A slightly higher income tax rate was primarily attributable to unfavorable discrete items.","We still believe the effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year, we should see a slight immaterial tax benefit in our second fiscal quarter of 2015, as a result of the recent passage of the so called tax extenders.","As Vern mentioned earlier, cash flow generated from operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2015 was an impressive $46.7 million, which is a $3.3 million increase over the prior year, despite a much greater incentive compensation payout this year compared with last year.","Our operating working capital defined as account receivables plus inventory less accounts payable, decreased six days to an industry-leading 37 days and represents only about 12.5% of annualized revenues. Most of this improvement was in our management of inventory where we continue to improve our inventory turns while also improving our service levels.","In the first quarter of fiscal 2015, we spent $18.5 million on capital expenditures compared with $8.5 million in the prior year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2015. This expected uptick in capital expenditures compared with recent prior years is primarily due to projects that were delayed from fiscal year 2014 and investments necessary to support our growth.","In November 30, 2014, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $583 million, an increase of $30.5 million since August 31, 2014. Our total debt was $354 million. Consequently our cash exceeded debt at the end of the fiscal year. At November 31, 2014, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.8 million under our credit facility.","You may have seen last month that Moody's raised our debt rating to be AA2 with a stable outlook. They based their revise rating on our leading market share, modest leverage, solid interest coverage, attractive returns on capital, consistent free cash flow and higher margins as we transitioned to higher volumes of LED lighting fixtures and controls.","Moody's went on to say that Acuity\u2019s revenues and earnings will further benefit from the structural shift to LED lighting with further upside should non-residential construction activity in North America begin to strengthen.","So in the last year both Standard & Poor's and now Moody's have revised upward our credit rating with positive comments about our outlook.","As you know, we have a significant amount of cash on our balance sheet. Additionally, we continue to generate strong free cash flow and an access to additional committed capital based on our credit facility.","Our capital allocation priorities have not changed. First, we will invest in capital expenditures for maintenance, cost savings and growth initiatives, which is expected to be around 2% of revenue this year.","Next we will continue to see strategic acquisitions to add technology, fill product gaps and\/or expand our market access. The timing of acquisitions of course are hard to predict. We remain active, but disciplined.","Lastly, we will continue to return capital to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock buybacks. We clearly have significant financial strength and flexibility and will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you and I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky.","As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving, particularly for us. Our growth expectations for the lighting industry primarily in North America has not really changed much over the last few quarters. We remain very positive.","So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide you with some observations for the balance of fiscal 2015.","First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest and increasing pace. Our forecast for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely.","The consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North American is expected to grow in the mid to upper single-digit range for our fiscal 2015, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity.","Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American market such as architectural billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve while residential construction continues to grow nicely.","As this becomes the norm over the last handful of years, we are always leery of the next round of uncertainty that might come out of Washington as well as fiscal and foreign policy issues. As you know, the manner in how these key issues are handled can meaningfully influence business and consumer confidence.","Nonetheless, we continue to expect that overall demand in our end markets for 2015 will continue to improve and be more broad-based and consistent than that experienced in either 2013 or 2014. The continued favorable trend in our December order rate again seems to support this continuing level of improvement.","Second, excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input cost over the next 12 months as some commodity cost have waned while others continue to rise.","Further we expect employee related cost to continue to rise primarily due to wage inflation and the negative impact of rising healthcare cost. Next we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are impossible to predict.","Of course we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture as well as furthering efforts to drive productivity improvements.","Another observation, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, price, product and sales channel mix and innovation, we expect our annual growth profit margin to improve over time as volumes grows particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix and as we continue to realize typical gains and manufacturing efficiencies.","Our gross profit margin in the first quarter was a good example of our potential, but we prefer to look at our marginal improvement over a 12-month period to remove quarterly anomalies like year\u2019s second quarter due to weather or the seasonality of the second quarter in general to discern proper trends. You should do the same, it is a positive picture.","Additionally, we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and sales channels. We will continue to be vigilant on pricing.","As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors, should they intend to use prices as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly and most importantly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company we're very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform including the introduction of holistic lighting solutions like connecting smart lighting with smartphones for retailers as well as our growing of electronic component capabilities.","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, while our strategies to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy is really the next step in the advancement of our overall growth strategy.","Additionally we continue to see opportunities in this environment including benefits from growing portions of the market, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels and growth from the introduction of new lighting solution. Our positive results reflect a solid execution of these strategies by our associates.","Our company-wide strategy is straightforward. Expand and leverage our industrial-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capital on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns.","This all takes focus and resources. We're realigning certain resources and continuing to make additional investments in certain areas today because we see great future opportunity. ","Through these investments we will have significantly expanded our addressable market, our record growth supports this view.","As I've said before, we believe the lightening and lightening related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the internet of things.","We continue to believe that the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential.","As the North American market leader, we're positioned well to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Winnie Clark of UBS, your line is open.","Winnie Clark","Good morning and congratulations on another outstanding result. Maybe to start with -- hello, can you hear me?","Vern Nagel","Yes we can, please.","Winnie Clark","Oh, sorry. So maybe to start with volume growth. Another quarter of impressive volume growth, despite the fact you were facing a pretty difficult comp. Given it sounds like you expect the underlying end-market to continue to improve as the year progresses, your comps also ease a bit, should we expect your volume growth to accelerate from here on a year-on-year basis?","Vern Nagel","So Winnie when we look at the various leading market indicators, if you will whether its employment, whether it\u2019s delinquency and commercial loans, you're looking at absorption, vacancy rates, office rents, all of these signs are signaling positive momentum.","Our expectation for the balance of 2015 and really into 2016 is that all of these will contribute to the growth of the overall market, which again we're expecting to be mid to upper single digit range.","And so I am personally optimistic that assuming no exogenous event that the markets will continue to show favorable signs and allow us to continue to grow at very positive rates.","Our expectation is that we will outperform the growth rates of the markets that we serve. This is the seventh quarter in a row where we've had double digit of volume gains against the backdrop of kind of mid single digit growth in the overall market.","So we continue to be optimistic about what the markets and the opportunities in front of Acuity continue to be.","Winnie Clark","And then maybe just on LEDs. You highlight again prices coming down on these products and that means that the value proposition gets increasingly more attractive. I am curious how adoption rates are trending across your various markets.","I know outdoor is largely converted, but how are adoption rates trending in some of your other channels? Any notable bright spots or laggards?","Vern Nagel","Well when we say outdoor has converted I would say that outdoor has converted primarily for new types of insulations. There is a tremendous installed base of conventional light sources for outdoor for example, so when we look at the market, we kind of look at it in two buckets if you will, sort of the new construction bucket and then the renovation bucket.","I would submit to you that the renovation bucket is still largely untapped from a if you will a digital lighting source, So our view is that the opportunities in that installed base to continue to renovate and convert will provide great growth opportunities for Acuity and the industry for a long time to come.","New construction for sure in many applications, whether it be indoor or outdoor is now really quiet accessible for electronic type lighting and when you particularly couple that with lighting solutions that integrate controls as well as LED lighting it provides an opportunity for Acuity to create exceptional value prepositions for customers, whether its school, healthcare facilities, commercial office building, industrial spaces, parking garages and so on and so forth because of the value that can be had by controlling these lights in a way that takes advantage of daylight harvesting, takes advantage of dimming if you will.","So we see quite bit of growth in front of us both in terms of the new constructions as well as the renovation.","I would say that when you look at which areas are tipping faster or say slower than the others, I will submit to you that they're all moving fairly quickly.","Again I would also remind folks the beauty of Acuity is that we listen to our customers. We provide to them solutions that make the most sense for them and we're almost agnostic to the light source.","And conventional lightening, florescent is still a very viable value proposition today. I believe that the industry trend all of the prognosticator say that by 2020, the industry could be 80% LED. I have no qualms around that at all.","But in the meantime, we want to continue to make sure that we're providing our customers with the solutions that make the most sense for them.","Winnie Clark","Great. Thanks so much and congratulations again.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities","Rich Kwas","Hi. Good morning. Just a question, Vern, on incremental shares. So very strong this quarter; you're taking some actions on the SG&A front. Ricky, you mentioned that you are going to spend away some of that, but the 33% this quarter really excluded all the streamlining activities, I would think.","So how should one think about what happened this quarter and try to translate that on a go-forward basis, given your comments about the end markets?","Vern Nagel","Sure, the 33% does contemplate if you will the adjusted -- the incremental adjusted operating profit dollars on the incremental sales. We have typically said that our target is kind of in that mid 20s, mid to upper 20% variable contribution rate because we do expect to continue to reinvest back into our business as we see growth opportunity that LED is enabling Acuity to provide.","As we had mentioned earlier our tiered solutions approach really is taking if you will discrete components and now bringing these things together so that you can provide customers with holistic solutions for whatever application they need.","Our belief is that we will continue to drive productivity into our business. We will continue to see volume growth. So all of those should have very favorable impact on both our variable contribution, margin, as well as our gross profit margin on a go-forward basis.","But we feel comfortable in that sort of mid to upper mid 20% range because it is our expectation to continue to invest back into our business for skills and capabilities to really allow us to get after more of what if you will digital lighting can allow a company like Acuity to do.","It was a great quarter. And we've had other quarters, by the way where our variable contribution margin has been in the 30s. So it's not unusual for it to happen, but I think when you look at over a 12-month trend we would be more comfortable in the mid to upper 20% range because of the investments that we continue to make.","Rich Kwas","Yes. that\u2019s what I was getting at because the numbers -- you've had some very strong quarters followed by some quarters that have been relatively low, so they have been -- there's been some volatility. So that's kind of the crux of my question.","Vern Nagel","So Rich, we would encourage you to not look at just quarterly numbers, but instead to look at it over a longer period of time where I think the quarters are tough to precisely predict spending in investment and the things that you're doing. But when you look over a 12-month, I think you really get a good sense of what we're capable of doing.","Rich Kwas","Okay, yes. No, I appreciate that. And then on the fixed versus SD&A for the quarter, what were the numbers on SD&A? Do have the range because I know that number, the fixed number, was going up?","And I know last quarter you had some incentive comp that hit -- that make it go up more significantly and there sounded like there were some incentive comp this quarter, but you were --. I think, Vern, you were talking about 105 is a good run rate. Were you at that level this quarter?","Vern Nagel","So, Ricky admonishes me from calling it fixed because it has a variable element in there. But the number that you're referring to is roughly in the sort of $95 million to $100 million range.","Some of that had to do with the timing of expenses. Our incentive compensation this quarter versus the year ago quarter was about the same. We did have some wage inflation, but we offset that with some productive improvements and some opportunities of just lower spending in some other areas.","The spending in some of the areas probably had more to do with a bit of timing. We're not uncomfortable with again that $105 million kind of number, but it really depends on each quarter.","If you look at that spend over the course of the year, the number I think last year averaged about $95 million maybe a little bit more than that. So this year my expectations will probably be in that lower $100 million and $105 million range.","Rich Kwas","Okay, that's helpful. Then last one from me on the mix. The business is a lot more weighted toward renovation at this point. But, Vern, over the last couple of quarters you've been more positive about what you are seeing on the new construction side or the early stages of that.","In the quarter and then going forward, do you sense that the new construction piece is going to reverse course and increase a bit on a percentage of sales basis over the course of 2015 and into 2016? Should we think about that, because that obviously helps mix a bit? So I wanted to get your thoughts there.","Vern Nagel","So when you think about new construction you actually have to think about vertical applications, schools, healthcare, facilities, commercial office buildings, religious facility, so on and so forth.","And Dodge provides and there are a number of groups that provide great information around this. What you're seeing is a larger trend because of the earlier statistics and things that I quoted earlier starting to improve and so this tide is lifting all loads.","Healthcare facilities right now are lagging a little bit. Schools K-12 tend to lag a little bit, but the other aspects of the economy again whether it's commercial office buildings, industrial facilities, outdoor all of these things are starting to find their stride and they're improving and they're improving on a more consistent basis.","The thing I would say about new construction is that there is a specification element that requires a timeframe. So if someone says, I am going to build a building today by the time lighting finds its way and to say a fairly large structure, it could be 12 to 24 months later.","Smaller projects, sure lightings will find its way into that sooner, but we're starting to see greater quotations, again architecture billing index, office absorption, office rental rates are improving.","All these sings I think what give the prognosticators, the Dodges of the world confidence that will be the kind of growth that both has been and the incremental growth that they're calling for.","Rich Kwas","But are you worried about oil and gas at this point with -- on your business specifically, given CapEx reductions and what not?","Vern Nagel","Sure I think that there is a great debate out there about where you have some folks who are operating drilling machines and so on and so forth. How does that flow back?","Personally, our business is so diversified geographically that the consumer getting that huge extra cash in their pocket because of longer gas prices, we think has a stimulating effect more broadly around the North American market, which I personally think will be favorable.","Rich Kwas","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Jed Dorsheimer of Canaccord Genuity.","Jed Dorsheimer","Hi, thanks and congratulations on another fantastic quarter here guys.","Vern Nagel","Thanks Jed.","Jed Dorsheimer","First question, I guess you touched on volumes in terms of driving margins and clearly LEDs are neutral to the overall business as they are now 42% of sales. But I'm curious if you could help a little bit on solution versus discrete or systems versus discrete as you've added the controls aspect into the business.","Could we put a percentage or how should we look at what portion of your business is going to a systems solution, which I would assume carries higher margin and certainly carries higher ASPs as we think about that going forward? And then I have a follow-up.","Vern Nagel","Sure, so Jed in our product selection guide, we articulate on one of the first few pages are sought of tiered solutions approach. If I had to tell you where we are in that game, I would say that the managers are still at home played exchanging a line of cards.","So the bulk of what we sell today is device discrete capability when you look at our total volume, but the growth rates in what we call Tier 2 and Tier 3 where you're adding more capability to luminarie or the Tier 3 where you're offering a holistic solution where it all works together.","Those growth rates are quite significant on a very small base. So the percentage is great. The dollars are smaller relative to the total. Our margin profile tends to be greater in the Tier 2 and Tier 3 area, but it's still very early for us to say what will that difference be on a go-forwards basis.","We certainly have an expectation that we can add more value when we bring together a holistic solution for our customers and that value to them allows them to really again do more things energy savings so on and so forth.","But it's no longer just energy savings and if you look at our visible light communication system for the retail space, we're just -- we're so early in that, but the opportunity for margin and enhancement for both our customers, which is just extraordinary as well as for Acuity sharing and that we're still like I say so early in the game. It's not had a meaningful impact yet on our overall margin performance.","Jed Dorsheimer","Okay, great. And then just as a follow-up: I got the fixed component of SD&A correct based on your previous comment, but I guess I was too conservative with respect to variable component of SD&A, which looks like it took a big drop down quarter over quarter.","I know we should look at the longer-term trends, but is there something that is driving that that I should be more aware of? Or is this sort of the normal level and then we should just expect as volumes change that would be the only driving factor of the variable component of SD&A? Thank you.","Vern Nagel","So let me answer your question a couple of different ways. The piece that we call that is truly variable freight and commissions those numbers as a percentage have been fairly consistent over the last several, several quarters and it can isolate 10 bips to 20 bips one way or the other, but it's pretty consistent around that 11.6%.","All the rest of our SDA, which we -- some folks have referred to is fix and I guess someone had started that, so shame on me, Ricky punishes me for that, but that portion, that can vary a little bit and some of the spending obviously on salaries and wages and healthcare cost, but it's also marketing.","It's travel, its product development and also it's incentive compensation. The incentive compensation this quarter compared to the year-ago period was fairly flat. It was up, but not by a huge amount. So we had some puts and takes in there and we always will.","That's why I think if you look at it over the course of the year, our sense is, is that you get a better average. That doesn\u2019t mean one quarter to next won't be higher or lower. This quarter may have been just slightly lower due to the timing of some spending.","Our two sense around this and the best way to get at it is through the variable contribution margin on incremental sales, particularly when you have consistent incentive compensation year-over-year.","Again I want to remind everyone, our incentive compensation is totally pay for performance and it's based on period over period improvement. So our variable contribution rate this quarter was 34%, very robust and we're always looking to drive that, but we feel a little bit more comfortable in sort of that mid 20 to upper 20% variable contrition rate because we will continue to make investments in our business and it's not always -- we're not able to precisely estimate when that's going to occur.","Jed Dorsheimer","Great. Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson","Hi thanks for taking my questions today. What if any impact has the drop in oil prices had on the piece of your business and your planning? And I guess trying to string little bit further, have you see any change in bid activity over the past couple of months?","Vern Nagel","Ricky, could you answer the first?","Ricky Reece","Yes, first on the oil price Kathryn, as we mentioned in the 10-K, we consume about four million gallons each year of diesel fuel. Of course we have seen a reduction in diesel fuel not to the extent that you\u2019ve seen in the price of a barrel of oil, but we have seen a reduction and people are projecting further.","So far it has not been material. You're talking a few hundred thousand dollars of benefit as Vern said our variable cost, which includes freight and commission was pretty consistent, so a little bit of benefit, not much.","Obviously if diesel continues to drop, you could be getting into a few millions of dollars. You can do the math on four million gallons and whatever you think, diesel is going to drop.","We should see a benefit in the freight cost we do as I say have it there. Beyond freight we're really not seeing it much in other areas. Obviously petroleum based goes into some of the lenses and plastics that we use, but so forth it's not had a material impact on the cost of those products.","Vern Nagel","And Kathryn, with regard to the bid activity, I would remind everyone that our second quarter is seasonally our softest quarter simply because of weather. It's December, January and February.","Having said that, our bid activity is up over the year ago period and our expectation based on what we see from folks, things that haven\u2019t yet turned it a bit, but just activity, particularly driven around things like the architectural billing index is a good example of that.","Our folks are busy and so our expectation is that, as I said earlier non-residential construction on the new construction site will continue to show a positive rebound and we will particularly see that in the second half.","Kathryn Thompson","Thank you. And then maybe touching point string a little bit more on that comment, if you what specifics or even some general issue can get around your projections for new construction versus renovation or retrofit growth projections in 2015 and also when thinking about what's the difference today versus it was a year ago in terms of the end markets.","What end markets or segments are doing better this year and we've seen maybe perhaps more of a turnaround just to give you some perspective for us. Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Sure and so on the end markets if you will and if you look at the market and separated by verticals, you look at commercial office buildings, which are starting to ramp up and what's exciting for us about that is when a commercial office building based on construction put in place starts to uptick, we know that ultimately will be putting luminaire and lighting controls into those buildings.","So I'll say commercial office buildings, industrial spaces, outdoor continues to be favorable area infrastructure all of these things are up-ticking. Healthcare is still lagging a tad as it is K-12. So we expect that as the economy moves up, as people continue to go back to work, as they pay taxes, the demographics are such at that that the K-12 market, we need more schools and so our expectation is that over the next 1,000 days, you'll start to see that market tick up.","But let's be clear, from a new construction standpoint employment people going back to work are the most critical factor and building buildings, we really -- we see absorption occurring at very healthy clip. So markets are starting to tighten up. You're seeing rental rates for any type of space whether it's a commercial office building or even industrial spaces starting to tick up.","All those suggest that the rebirth if you will of investment that will occur in the non-residential construction real estate market and we view that as a very favorable sign obviously for Acuity.","And then you couple on that by the way the ability to sell more value ad per square foot in the old days we would have sold the luminaire. Today we're selling not only a quality of life, but we're selling energy solutions for these folks as well. So it's quite an opportunity for Acuity going forward.","Kathryn Thompson","If you take a stab just in terms of general thoughts on new construction versus retrofit in the commercial market in 2015?","Vern Nagel","I would say that new construction will be accretive. What will be the exact percentage put of our business between new construction and renovation has not to guess that right now because I don't have the precise data that's always kind of a rear view mirror activity.","We're positioned uniquely well to serve both and we're aggressively going after all opportunities in both.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Glen Wortman of Sidoti & Company.","Glen Wortman","Yes, good morning, everyone.","Vern Nagel","Good morning.","Glen Wortman","Yes and I am sorry to beat the dead horse here, but I missed earlier, does the $100 million to $105 million per quarter that you're expecting this year in the sixth piece of SG&A, does that include incentive-based comp?","Ricky Reece","That would yes.","Glen Wortman","Okay. Okay. And then on non-res construction, I am sorry if I missed this too earlier, but did you say how much that up in the quarter?","Vern Nagel","I am sorry, say that again.","Glen Wortman","Yes, your sales derived from non-res construction in the quarter, do you know how much that was up year-over-year?","Vern Nagel","No.","Glen Wortman","Okay. All right. Thank you for taking my questions.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Josh Chan of Robert W. Baird.","Josh Chan","Hi, good morning guys. Great quarter. on your streamlining actions and investments, could you give us little bit more color on what particularly you are restructuring out of your cost structure and then also where you're making those incremental investment?","Vern Nagel","Sure Ricky.","Ricky Reece","Yes, first on the cost reduction, most of it is in salary cost and related benefits. As we mentioned, it's an SD&A and then we're consolidating some production activities. So you will see a portion of the cost as well as the savings up in gross margin category.","Areas of reinvestment will largely be in SD&A and engineering as we continue to build out our capabilities and skill sets to service the solution offerings. It will be in sales and marketing areas as we get the training and the marketing for these broader solutions and capabilities that are out there as well as the collateral and so forth.","And then pre-imposed sales support area in the sales and marketing to be able to service these broader solution offerings both in the design phase, commissioning stage as well as in the final post sales when you go back and help with any final commissioning and set up or issues that may come in.","So mainly in SD&A, in engineering, sales and marketing is where we would reinvest and then in engineering for product development and service capabilities.","Josh Chan","Okay. Great. And then you guys have previously talked about learning to fish better in the renovation pool. I was just wondering if your market share in renovation is what that would be compared to your market share in new construction and where you're traditionally stronger or have you closed that gap over the last couple of years.","Vern Nagel","Again it's -- we use estimates, it's impossible for us to predict. We sell products through 14 different channels and not often or not all of the channels are we able to discern exactly where that product is going. If there was a specifier involved and it was someone redoing a K-12 school, all that's renovation. It looks like new construction to us.","If that person doesn\u2019t necessarily tell us what the materials are being used for or we don't know, so I wouldn\u2019t be giving you good information to say I know one versus the other.","Josh Chan","Okay. Great. Thanks for your time and congrats on the quarter.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Ryan Merkel of William Blair & Company","Ryan Merkel","Thanks. The first question I had is on price competition as it relates to the large project specification business versus stock and flow. Is there a noticeable difference in price competition in those two applications today?","Vern Nagel","So Ryan, the way I'm going to answer your question is, if you take both of those compared to say prior year, I would say that bid competition it's for new construction virtually the same.","The marketplace hasn\u2019t materially changed and how it competes and so on and so forth and we haven\u2019t seen any meaningful change there and I would say the same thing would be true for stock and flow. The way the market competes for those pieces of business are the same.","On the stock and flow side, the opportunity to work with key strategic distributor partners is a major focus Acuity and we try to provide them with the fulsomeness of support, strength and project as well as the support and opportunities of working together on stock and flow.","So I don't see that competition is necessarily different between those or in those markets today, but we're looking to leverage our skill and capability with our strategic partners in both of those areas.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. That's helpful. And then second question, you mentioned broad-based strength in the quarter and I was wondering does this include retrofits for multi-tenant buildings and also for municipalities? Because my understanding was those two parts of the market were a little softer.","Vern Nagel","Yes, when I say broad-based, I am trying to sort of dance along the mountain tops. I think that Dodge for example tracks over 100 different vertical applications. I don't look at all of those. I know that within their schools K-12s are still soft.","There are other markets that are still soft if you will. Healthcare is still soft, but broadly speaking both geographically as well as for us across a broad range of product and application, the growth was reasonably broad based. That again does not mean that smaller parts don't or haven\u2019t experienced some still softness.","Ryan Merkel","Could you comment on multi-tenant retrofits though? Is that improving a bit or is that still a bit slower?","Vern Nagel","Yes, I personally can't comment. Ricky, do you have any sense. I didn't\u2026","Ricky Reece","I would just make one comment, in multi-tenant, a lot of that is more residential focused obviously within the apartments of the condominiums that are being built where our participation is lower. We obviously participate in the common areas, the parking garages, the outdoor lighting and so forth.","They continue to build out our capability within the living spaces of multi-tenant, but it's an area that we're a little less penetrated and we would be in other commercial buildings.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray.","Mike Ritzenthaler","Yes, good morning. Just one question from me that wasn't already asked is, with LEDs now over 40% of total sales, what are some of the challenges that will be unique in going from 40% to 60% versus 10% to 40%? Or is it even useful to be thinking about growth in those terms?","Vern Nagel","Some of the challenges, I think that challenge is really our opportunities for Acuity as we continue to grow if you will LED as a larger portion of our sales. The opportunities are to incorporate those components as part of broader holistic solutions.","I had mentioned in answering Jed's question earlier that this tiered solutions approach, bringing these capabilities together to instead of offering just a single device, but instead offering a holistic solution for your building whether news commercial office, your office, the hallway, the conference rooms tied into the floor, tied into the building management.","All of those represent unique opportunities that weren\u2019t necessarily available to Acuity a handful of years ago. So to us it's bringing that capability to the end customer and doing it very efficiently.","So you could call that a challenge, but we look at that more as an opportunity to take advantage of, not only what we have done with our lighting portfolio, but the acquisitions that we've made to create again these types of very interesting solutions for the end customer.","Mike Ritzenthaler","That makes sense. Thanks and congrats.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","Hey guys. Thanks for taking the questions. I had two quick ones. First, on your commentary around digital lighting solutions, I was just curious if you guys had a sense of what percent of your business, whether it's just device or system-level solutions, is currently being sold into what you would consider the smart lighting opportunity. And then how you might expect that to evolve as a part of the mix in 2015.","Vern Nagel","Sure. Again the notion of the Tier 3 solution, which again in our power lines are holistic lighting solution today is a very small portion of our business. Now I say very small again understands against the backdrop of $2.5 million business small and still fairly large.","That portion of our business would dwarf many of the lighting companies that are out there today, but again it's still very small. Our expectation is that really it's a 2016 where you'll see that Tier become a meaningful portion of our business because a lot of it has to do with new construction and get specified and it gets ramped up.","So we like the trends that we're seeing in those portions of the portfolio, but I think in 2015, it will still from a financial perspective not move the needle in a huge way, but it is laying the foundation for huge growth over the next handful of years.","Again we have said that we believe that our addressable market could grow by more than 50% over the next handful of years. A large portion of that growth is going to be in these Tier 2 or Tier 3 areas where we can add much more capability, add much more value to the end customer allowing us to sell these types of solutions at margins that are attractive.","Brian Lee","Okay. Great. And then as a follow-up to that, you commented around the portfolio and you've also made a number of acquisitions, particularly on the software side, which seems to position you well for that transition in the lighting market.","So I was wondering are there any tools in the portfolio that you can speak to tangibly that you are maybe more focused on for addressing in 2015. It seems like there are some M&A opportunities that you may be wanting to look at more actively here in the coming years. Thanks, guys.","Vern Nagel","Sure. The difference between saying that we have a hole in our portfolio versus that we see opportunities through acquisitions to add to our portfolio, I would like to say we're at the latter. We don't see any holes in what we're doing.","It doesn\u2019t -- again we don't do everything for everybody. That doesn\u2019t mean that we can't do more, but from an acquisition standpoint, we see opportunities to be accretive and add to the value proposition of what we're doing and that really is a primary focus of our acquisition strategy.","How can we take advantage of this technology to add even more value to the end customer because every location needs to have a light source in it, whether it's outdoor lighting and it has a light pool or whether it's indoor lighting and there is a luminaire in every type of building space.","These things can become communication devices that can be data collection devices and that is hugely powerful in terms of where the world is going and lighting can be right at the epicenter of all that and Acuity is working hard to really lead in that area.","So I don't see holes in our portfolio. I see opportunities for us to continue to expand our capabilities.","Brian Lee","Okay, thanks. Very helpful.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Brent Thielman of D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman","Yes, thank you. Just real quickly, a few quarters ago you talk about investments in some of these electronic components for LEDs and that would create some headwind for gross margins in subsequent quarters. Was that negligible this quarter or did you still face a little headwind there?","Vern Nagel","We have continued to improve our profitability in those areas. I wouldn\u2019t say that it was as much of a headwind this quarter as it has been in the past, but again I want to be clear, your question tees up something very important.","We took a special charge to again streamline our organization because we want -- we are de-investing certain areas of if you will older technologies, so that we can further our investment in some of these areas going forward.","As questions were asked earlier about what is that area of our SDA that is not greater commissions? Last year in 2014, that number averaged about 102 million a quarter, so when I think about where that number is, folks had asked us earlier where do you see that number.","As of today, I said $100 million, $105 million we will continue to invest, but we're also looking to de-invest. Do we have the right precise alchemy? One, we don't give guidance, what I would like to do is again direct people back towards our variable contribution margin.","We're looking to get every penny we can. This quarter was a fantastic quarter and we push ourselves to deliver these kinds of results, but we will continue to make investment back in our business and you cannot precisely predict that pace. So when I said that, that portion of our SDA that is not directly greater commissions, will operate between $100 million, $105 million.","There could be quarters where it will be even above that, but when we try to look at the average over a year, the better way to look at our company is not through fix. This portion of the SDA is looking at our variable contribution margins.","Again as I've said earlier, our incentive compensation is based period-over-period improvement. Our objective is to continue to knock the ball out of the park and so therefore our incentive compensation will grow. It's in that number that is not in the freighter commission portion of SDA.","So we don't give guidance and so it's a little bit of a difficult thing to predict our variable compensation. You guys in your own models can do this yourselves. If we keep knocking the ball out of the park, our incentive compensation will be higher than what it is right now. So we will drive that number higher.","So anyway that's just my true sense on how I think you ought to look at that.","Brent Thielman","Okay. I understand that. You talked a bit about the overall pipeline is up. I was just curious; does it feel as though there's more urgency among customers to secure Acuity's solutions? And I guess I'm thinking from the context of when you provide a customer a quote and when that translates into an order.","Vern Nagel","There is more activity out there. There is no doubt about that. And so to say urgency, people are building and people are renovating and the notion of how they do that, people -- building owners are becoming very comfortable with the notion that I can put in a solution that gives me a payback because of energy savings.","And so I don't know if I had used the work urgency, but acceptance and the desire to want to drive that to put their capital work to get cost savings, it's a return on investment story in that market. Yes, it's happening and when you look at folks who are building buildings, those things are coming out of the ground in the normal course and they're going about it the right way.","I would say that as absorption occurs, landlords when they finally find someone to consumer some space, the market has always been that I have someone. You need to provide me with 30 days and I want these folks in. That hasn\u2019t changed except for the fact that there is more of it happening.","So I wouldn\u2019t say that the urgency has changed. The business activity has really started to pick up, which is favorable.","Brent Thielman","Okay. So it doesn't sound like the quote to order timelines have materially changed, it's just more activity in general.","Vern Nagel","I would say it's correct.","Brent Thielman","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vern Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you for your time this morning. Again we strongly believe we're focusing on the right objectives deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the longer term to continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders.","Our future is very bright and thank you for your support.","Operator","Thank you for the participation. That does conclude today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"479":["Acuity Brands (NYSE:AYI) Q4 2013 Earnings Call October  1, 2013 10:00 AM ET","Executives","C.

Ricky and I would like to make a few comments, and then we will be happy to answer your questions.","First, let me say we are very pleased with our performance in 2013, particularly, the fourth quarter, where we achieved record results for net sales and diluted earnings per share. In the fourth quarter, net sales grew 13%, which was meaningfully higher than the estimated mid-single-digit growth rates for the key markets we serve. In fact, this was the second quarter in a row, where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a meaningful accomplishment in this environment. We believe this is, yet again, strong evidence our strategies to provide our customers with differentiated value propositions and diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position in North America. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative energy-efficient lighting solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity.","Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter and the full year were again strong, even as we continue to fund our strong sales growth in areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our solid-state luminaire and Lighting Controls portfolio.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights. First, for the quarter. Net sales for the quarter were a quarterly record of $580 million, an increase of 13% compared with the year-ago period. Reported operating profit was $78.2 million compared with $61.2 million in the year-ago period.","This quarter, we incurred a small special charge associated with carryover streamlining actions. In the year-ago period, we incurred a special charge for streamlining actions and related expenses, which in total, reduced operating profit by $6.5 million. Ricky will talk more about these special charges and related items later in the call.","I find it helpful to add back these items to make both quarter's results comparable. Doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $78.5 million compared with $67.7 million in the year-ago period, up 16%, while adjusted operating profit margin improved 30 basis points to a strong 13.5% Diluted earnings per share were a record $1.03 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $0.88 in the year-ago period, up 17%. Strong results indeed.","For the full year, net sales at Acuity were a record $2.1 billion, up 8% from 2012. Adjusted consolidated operating profit margin was 11.8%, up 10 basis points compared with the year-ago period. Adjusted diluted EPS was $3.31 per share, up 10% from 2012. In addition, we generated $132 million in net cash provided by operating activities, while funding a $55 million increase in accounts receivable due to our record sales growth.","As Ricky will discuss later, we meaningfully enhanced our already strong financial position in 2013, as we now have more cash than debt. Lastly, I'm pleased to report that we once again earned much more than our cost of capital, and our cash flow return on investment was a robust 24%, in spite of these challenging economic conditions. These results for the quarter and full year were significant improvements over the year-ago periods, especially for the quarter. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis.","While net sales grew 13% compared with the year ago, we estimate sales volume grew by more than 14%, partially offset by lower price mix. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes, we believe the difference was primarily due to changes in the channel mix, as well as mix of products sold and to a lesser degree, lower pricing on like-kind LED luminaires between periods, reflecting the decline in certain LED component costs. The impact of acquisition and some foreign currency in net sales were not significant.","The increase in net sales was broad based along most product lines, though certain specialty fixtures more closely associated with new construction again lagged the overall average due to the tepid environment for new nonresidential construction. We also experienced lower sales in Europe.","From a channel perspective, we continue to experience strong growth in commercial, industrial, infrastructure and home improvement, as well as continued growth for larger renovation projects. The mix of products sold on these larger renovation projects tend to have a lower gross profit margin profile than our overall average margin.","We also continue to experience a higher mix of sales of less featured value-oriented products sold through certain channels, particularly, home improvement, which also tend to have a lower-than-average margin profile. In spite of strong top line growth, the change in both product and sales channel mix, as previously noted, were the primary contributors to a slightly lower adjusted gross profit margin this quarter compared with the year ago.","Sales growth in our largest channel, commercial and industrial, was above this quarter's overall percentage increase, primarily due to a continued focus on smaller medium-sized projects for both new construction and renovation, as well as a continued emphasis on selling higher value-added lighting solutions, especially LED luminaires. Sales of these products again more than doubled compared with the year ago period. In fact, this is at least our 10th quarter in a row, where we have more than doubled the sales of our LED luminaires compared with the year-ago periods, far outpacing the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products.","Additionally, we continue to enjoy strong growth in our residential products, as demand for new housing and renovation of existing homes continued to rebound. We continue to experience growth in all major geographies and key channels in North America, all of which is encouraging, though this was partially offset by continued weakness in Europe. Excluding LED luminaires, we believe the puts and takes for product pricing, as well as material and component costs were again fairly benign this quarter.","Looking at overall market condition for the fourth quarter, we believe spending in key segments of the U.S. nonresidential construction market was down slightly compared with the year ago, while residential construction was up more than 20%. Further, we believe the overall lighting market was up mid-single digits during the quarter, supported by growth in renovation, as well as the residential market.","This is in stark contrast compared with the growth in our net sales in North America, which was up more than 15%. Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to achieve meaningful sales growth again this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability for the quarter and strategic accomplishments for the year. As we noted earlier, adjusted operating profit was $78.5 million, the most in our history. And adjusted operating profit margin for the fourth quarter was a strong 13.5%. Adjusted gross profit margin was 90 basis points lower this quarter compared with the year-ago period, as the benefits of lower material costs and productivity gains were more than offset by changes in channel and product mix, particularly, in the home improvement channel.","Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses were up approximately 8% on a net sales increase of 13%. SD&A expenses, as a percentage of net sales, were 27.4% in the quarter, a decline of 120 basis points from the year-ago period, reflecting the leverage of higher net sales.","The increase in SD&A expenses was due primarily to higher variable costs to support the record net sales and to fund activities focused on longer-term growth opportunities, including the addition of eldoLED, more robust marketing and sales support capabilities and investing in innovation and technology, primarily, for solid-state luminaires and integrated intelligent lighting systems. Investments in these areas are paying off, as our new product and solutions gain traction in the marketplace, driving revenue growth.","We all tend to compare a quarter's results to the prior year. Interestingly, if one were to compare our adjusted results for this fourth quarter to the results for the third quarter of 2013, where product and channel mix were similar, you would see that on a sequential basis, net sales were up 7.1%, adjusted operating profit was up almost 19%, and adjusted operating profit margin increased 130 basis points, while our variable contribution in those incremental sales was 32%, a very strong performance indeed.","On the strategic front, we accomplished a great deal in 2013, setting the stage for what we believe will be even greater growth and profitability in 2014 and beyond. We continued our rapid pace of new product introductions, significantly expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls solutions.","To put this in perspective, we now offer customers more than 1.7 million SKUs to choose from, more than twice as many as we did in 2008. No one offers customers more choices and more solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our lighting controls and solid-state lighting product offering. For the full year, our LED sales more than doubled compared with 2012. Also, we continue to fund the development of holistic, integrated lighting solutions for specific applications, such as schools, health care facilities, commercial office building and various outdoor applications to fully leverage our award-winning portfolio of lighting fixtures, controls and components.","Additionally, we continue the development of luminaires, incorporating other light sources or other light technology, such as organic LEDs, where we continue to expand our award-winning portfolio of those innovative products. More impressively, our adjusted operating profit margin continued to expand this quarter, while sales of LED-based solutions have become a larger portion of our overall business.","Acuity is a clear leader in both conventional and digital lighting solutions. It is because we understand the sophisticated needs of our expansive customer base that we offer each tailored solutions from our industry-leading portfolio regardless of the light source. Our expertise lies in the true understanding of the proper use and control of light while optimizing the use of energy. We are without equal in the design and development of fixtures and integrated lighting systems for virtually any application without a bias of the light source.","This expertise, coupled with a fully integrated lean supply chain, can produce virtually any type of fixture or lighting control system cost effectively and efficiently for our customers, because we are without the cumbersome and expensive investment in legacy costs needed to produce certain components, like lamps or LED chips. We source these components to our design specification from the best suppliers around the globe. This structure allows us to bring customers with superior value, while delivering upper quartile returns for our shareholders.","Our formidable strength in innovation was on full display again in 2013, where Acuity won numerous industry awards for indoor and outdoor LED lighting and control solutions. And we continue to add even more capabilities, including the acquisitions of Adura and eldoLED.","eldoLED is a leader in the design and manufacture of high-performance intelligent drivers for LED-based lighting systems. The acquisition of eldoLED gives us and our OEM customers unique capabilities to provide unparalleled lighting solutions to the ultimate end user, including color changing, tunable light and complete dimming solutions, which eliminate the stroboscopic effects that are prevalent with many of the LED fixtures in the industry today. As I have noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during years of technology disruption. And that is even more true today.","Acuity Brands is leading the evolution to intelligent lighting solutions, with its broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor solid-state and traditional energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls. And we are delivering profitable growth and strong financial returns for our shareholders, while making these important investments. These accomplishments have diversified and strengthened our foundation and will further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less realigned on the new commercial construction cycle.","We've been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our 6,500 associates and the progress they have made in 4 key areas of strategic focus: customer service; pricing and margin management; geographical channel and product portfolio expansion, including significant additions to our industry-leading stable of sustainable and energy-efficient lighting solutions; and, of course, company-wide productivity.","I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2014. Ricky?","Richard K. Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight a few items regarding our income statement. I then will discuss our cash flow and financial condition before turning the call back to Vern. Vern covered the primary drivers for our sales growth and our profitability, so I'll not repeat these items, but I will provide a bit more color on certain aspects of our fourth quarter results.","Let's first look at our special charge related to streamlining activities. Fiscal 2013 fourth quarter results include a $0.3 million pretax special charge associated with the streamlining activities announced in the prior quarter to streamline the organization through the planned closure of 2 small production facilities, as well as the realignment of responsibilities, primarily, within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. We recognized last quarter a pretax special charge related to these streamlining actions, totaling $7.2 million. The total pretax special charge consists almost entirely of severance and employee-related costs.","The production facilities we are closing, manufacturing -- manufacture less than 2% of our total production, and we expect to complete the closures and related transfer of production by the end of the calendar year. We currently expect to incur production transfer expenses and other costs of approximately $2 million over the next 2 fiscal quarters related to this streamlining action. We estimate the total annualized pretax savings associated with this streamlining action to be approximately $15 million, of which, approximately $2 million was realized in our fourth fiscal quarter of fiscal 2013.","We currently expect to be at the full annualized run rate by the end of the calendar year, assuming the production transfers occur according to our current plans. These savings should help offset important investments we are continuing to make to expand our product and solution portfolio and enhance our production, distribution and customer service and support capabilities.","Included in the prior year's fourth fiscal quarter results was a pretax special charge and expense associated with streamlining actions, totaling $6.5 million or $0.10 per diluted share. As Vern said earlier, we find it useful to adjust our results for these items to make them more comparable, and we have included in our earnings release a full reconciliation of our GAAP amounts to these adjusted results.","As Vern mentioned earlier, our adjusted gross profit margin for our fourth fiscal quarter of 40.9% decreased 90 basis points compared with the year-ago period on an almost 13% increase in net sales, due largely to an unfavorable price mix, partially offset by the favorable impact of increased net sales and lower material and component costs.","Our adjusted operating profit margin increased 30 basis points to 13.5% compared with the adjusted operating margin in the year-ago period, as we were able to offset the unfavorable gross margin percentage comparison.","Our SD&A expense, as a percentage of net sales, declined to 27.4%, or 120 basis points below the same period last year, demonstrating we are seeing the benefits from the investments we have made in our business and the streamlining of our organization.","Let's next turn our attention to some of our results below the operating earnings line. We had essentially no net miscellaneous income in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2013 compared with miscellaneous expense in the prior year of $2.8 million. The miscellaneous expense recognized in the fourth quarter of last year was due primarily to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily Mexico peso-denominated items.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 36.1% compared with 34.4% in the fourth quarter of last year. This higher effective tax rate was due primarily to the impact of the United Kingdom, reducing its corporate tax rate by 3 percentage points, which should benefit us going forward, but required a current period reduction in the U.K. deferred tax assets.","This one-time adjustment to the deferred tax asset due to the tax rate change negatively impacted diluted EPS by over $0.01 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2013. We estimate the effective tax rate for our fiscal year 2014 will be approximately 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","Now let's look at cash flow for the fiscal year ended August 31, 2013. Cash flow generated from operations for fiscal year 2013 was $132.3 million compared with $172.2 million in the prior year. A decrease in cash flow from operating activities during fiscal year 2013 compared with the prior year was due primarily to an increase in operating working capital to support greater sales.","Total operating working capital of 38 days at August 31, 2013, was up 3 days compared with the prior year. In fiscal year 2013, we spent $40.6 million on capital expenditures compared with only $31.4 million in the prior year period, or an increase of $9.2 million. This increase in expenditures is largely related with the capital associated with adding additional capacity in the plants, receiving the production transfer from the Cochran facility, expansion of manufacturing capability in certain other locations and tooling associated with the large number of new products. We currently expect to spend approximately $50 million in capital expenditures in the fiscal year 2014.","At August 31, 2013, we had a cash balance of almost $360 million and total debt of $354 million. Consequently, at the end of fiscal 2013, our cash exceeded debt, so we had no net debt. In addition, at August 31, 2013, we had additional borrowing capacity of $244.3 million under our credit facility that does not mature until January 2017. So we continue to maintain a significant amount of financial flexibility.","Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities. While we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to add a few observations regarding our expectations for 2014.","First, as we have noted before, we anticipate that businesses and consumers in North America will accelerate their spending as the economy continues to improve, although we still expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging due to a slower-than-normal recovery. Forecast for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely. The consensus estimate is the broad lighting market in North America will grow in the mid-single-digit range for our entire fiscal 2014. This is modestly better than the economic conditions we experienced in 2013 and certainly better than the expectations for the overall growth of the nonresidential construction market. Additionally, we expect the European economies to remain weak, particularly Spain.","Also, there are other signs that continue to give us optimism regarding the future growth of our business. Leading indicators in the North American market, such as the Architectural Billings Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the rebound in residential construction continue to be favorable. As you know, there is a lag in the new construction cycle between the design phase of projects and the ultimate purchase of lighting fixtures and controls.","All this may be somewhat tampered by the next round of uncertainty to come out of Washington regarding the U.S. budget and debt limit discussions. Therefore, our overall expectation for our fiscal 2014 is that demand in our end markets will continue to improve and be more consistent and broad based, but with some volatility in demand among certain sales channels and geographies. The favorable trend in our September order rates seems to support this level of improvement.","Second, the industry continues to experience some volatility with respect to input costs. While some commodity costs have waned, others continue to rise. As of now, we expect material input cost to be relatively flat for the balance of calendar 2013, except for certain LED components, which should continue to decline.","Further, we expect employee-related costs will continue to rise due to wage inflation and the negative impact of Obamacare on health care cost. Of course, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture, as well as furthering efforts to drive productivity improvements to help offset rising costs, as evidenced by the expected benefits in fiscal year 2014 from streamlining actions we took in the second half of fiscal 2013.","Next, while our gross profit margin is influenced by sales volume, as well as product and channel mix, we expect our gross profit margin to improve over time, as volumes grow, particularly, for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix, as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies. Additionally, we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and channels, such as home improvement. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly, we expect to continue to outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform. As I noted in our last several conference calls, our strategy is to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same. We continue to see opportunities in this environment, including benefits from growing portions of the market, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels and growth from the introduction of new lighting solutions. Our strong results reflect the solid execution of these strategies by our associates.","As the industry leader in North America, we believe we are uniquely positioned with key suppliers around the globe to continue to bring greater and more differentiated value to our customers, incorporating advanced technologies, providing superior lighting quality and more sustainable energy solutions.","Our product and solutions portfolio has continued to expand rapidly due to our extensive internal development capabilities, supported by a focused acquisition strategy. Our company-wide strategy is straightforward, expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are funding these activities today, because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market, and our sales growth reflects what we believe are the early stages of this opportunity.","As I've said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly, as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential. As the market leader, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Lee.","Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","First off, I guess, you've given us the percent of sales from LED in past quarters. Is it fair to assume that LED was about 21% of sales this quarter, given the commentary around doubling year-over-year?","Vernon J. Nagel","The answer is that we have given that, and we continue to double. And so, given the rate of growth that we have, we thought it was becoming less significant as the percentage of the total. The number is actually higher than that. But again, we are very focused on selling our complete portfolio to folks and growing those -- that aspect of the business, where customers want to take us. And, certainly, LED solutions continue to be a meaningful part of our business and a meaningful part of our future. We were growing at extremely fast rates compared to the industry, particularly, for folks of our size.","Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I guess, on that same note. You guys do appear to be well outgrowing peers in the industry overall in that particular technology category. Can you speak to what some of the specific drivers, in your view are of the outperformance and growth? And I guess, is there meaningful share gains that are a big part of that, that you're seeing in net debt competitions?","Vernon J. Nagel","We believe we are gaining share in key segments of the market that we serve. I believe our growth is driven around a couple of things. One, we're a true lighting experts. We understand the needs of our very diverse customer base, which is the most diverse in the industry. And we're able to bring tailored lighting solutions to their needs on a good-better-best value proposition. Our sales forces, we sell through 14 different sales forces. They're virtually #1 in all of their markets. So we're leveraging our customer access. We're leveraging the growth in our product portfolio. We're leveraging our supply chain capabilities and our service capabilities to win in the marketplace. I don't think that the market is overly robust, mid-single-digit growth for the lighting industry, driven by new construction, as well as and, primarily, by renovation. I just think that we are uniquely positioned with the investments that we've made over the last handful of years to really capture market share growth, while participating in any growth that the market makes available.","Brian K. Lee - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. Last quick one, if I could just squeeze it in. Given the mix of that you are seeing through the month of September, how would you expect the slight negative impact you saw this quarter from pricing and mix trend for the upcoming quarter or the current quarter?","Vernon J. Nagel","So -- thank you. So what we try to do was give a sense of what mix look like and performance this quarter relative to our previous third quarter, so you could see on a sequential basis with like kind mix, how our profitability and our variable contribution margins now starting to flow through. So compared to the third quarter, revenues were up about 7% on a sequential basis. But you saw about 130 basis point improvement in margins on essentially the same mix. And more importantly, the variable contribution on that incremental 7% of revenues was about 32%. So while -- if you were to compare us to 2014, the mix shift in our business did have an impact on gross margins, particularly, as we penetrated the larger renovation-type projects, particularly, as we grow in certain channels like home improvement, it did have some dilutive effect on our gross profit margin. But we continue to take cost out. We continue to drive productivity throughout our business. And we continue to invest in our business. The acquisition of eldoLED, it's a technology-based business. It has small revenues. It has an expense base to it. So it's not making money just yet, but it will. And so these investments for us, I think, are critical to our future growth potential. When you kind of look at an apple to an apple, we actually, in the fourth quarter, had very strong results and consistent, in my view, with what people might expect from us, as we have this level of revenue and this level of growth. And when you compare that back to our last high watermark in 2008, where we had no LED sales, where the market was at its all-time peak, we're not even close to being back to those levels in terms of what the market is making available. The outperformance is now fairly consistent with what we experienced back then, just a slightly different mix.","Operator","The next question comes from Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","I'm going to stick to 2 questions you asked us to ask. First question is, what percentage of sales are retrofits in fiscal '13? And how is this different from 2 to 3 years ago, and expand a little bit on your retrofit strategy going forward?","Vernon J. Nagel","So Kathryn, it's a great question, impossible to precisely answer. But our guesstimate is that probably half of our revenues in fiscal 2013 were some form of renovation, whether there was a specifier involved and they were renovating a school, for example, or whether it was a renovation without specification going through distribution and\/or through other channels. I think if you were to compare that back to 2008, I believe that probably 75% of the market was driven by more new construction and that other 25% or so driven by some type of renovation.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC","That's helpful. And related -- talking about LED, maybe switching gears, fluorescent is obviously still very important for you. Has there been any change in your market share for the fluorescent market over the past 2, 3 years? And maybe spend a bit more of what is LED adoption replacing in terms of the overall technology.","Vernon J. Nagel","Again, very good question. Fluorescent is very important to the entire industry still. Fluorescent, for many applications, is still a very, very economical alternative to other light sources that are out there. Again, Acuity is agnostic to the light source, but we are maniacally focused on the application and having the right solution for that customer. An interesting little factoid. If you go back to 2008, fluorescent made up 42% of the total light source of the market at that point in time. In 2012, fluorescent made up 43% of the market. Most people would have thought that LED would have displaced that. LED is displacing other lesser efficient sources, such as HID than fluorescent. Our view is, is that over the next 3 years, half of the market could be converted to LED. We're not -- we don't know. But actually, we don't care because we are agnostic to the light source. What we do know is this, by 2015 or any period you want, the market is going to be made up of more than 0% LED and less than 100%. What Acuity is focused on is making sure that we have the complete lighting solution package for that customer. And this is why I pointed out the number of SKUs that we have today, it is proliferated meaningfully because of controls LED and other light source type products, such as OLED. We are very focused on making sure that we can meet the customers' needs irrespective of that light source. And the other thing I would say is Acuity, I believe today, is unmatched in its capability and understanding of light sources as it has been. And this is what you're seeing our outsize growth of our LED portfolio compared to the market. We have great products and we understand the application. In our fluorescent business, I mean, again, we don't look at these as separate businesses. We look at them as, again, total portfolio and solutions. In our factories, we have cells that are right next to each other that one is producing an LED-based luminaire and the other one is a fluorescent luminaire. So again, we don't look at these as separate businesses. We look at it as a holistic portfolio of being offered to the customer base. I hope that's helpful.","Operator","The next question comes from Colin Rusch, Northland Capital Markets.","Colin W. Rusch - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Can you talk about the margin benefit as you shift towards new construction from the retrofit, and how big do you think that gross margin benefit could be as we look over the next couple of years?","Vernon J. Nagel","It's a very good question. I think, again, if you go back to 2008, the last high watermark of nonresidential new construction, we like new construction because we're able to offer a very broad mix of product onto that construction site. And we tend to sell a more rich mix of specialty-based products, Lighting Controls, all of these tend to be accretive to the overall margin relative to large projects where there's a single fixture type that's renovation. And so, again, as I mentioned in the last couple of calls, Acuity has really honed its skill and capability at fishing in that renovation pond, which was relatively new for us, if you compare us back to 2008, while expanding if you will, our expertise around new construction types. So we would expect if that new construction market comes back, for it to have a positive contribution to our gross profit mix. And certainly, the volume, you saw this quarter what volume did on our SD&A expenses as a percentage of sales, we were able to, again, drive some nice leverage there as well.","Colin W. Rusch - Northland Capital Markets, Research Division","Okay. And then the dynamics around the ABI, some of the companies that we cover in this universe have pointed to a plus or minus 3 points as kind of living in the noise range. Obviously, we've had over 1 year of positive readings. But can you talk about what you guys see as the noise range on those ABI readings and then any sort of exhilaration that you're seeing in the conversion from design wins into actual orders on projects going forward?","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes. We believe that the ABI is a positive leading indicator. The lag, 6 to 12 months depending on the project. But we look at many other types of economic trends. So delinquency rates on commercial loans have come down dramatically. Tightening standards have, for commercial loans, have eased. The demand is now up. Vacancy rates are starting to show very nice, steady declines. Industrial availability is declining. Absorption of spaces improved meaningfully over the last couple of quarters. And so we've looked at all of that as being a more holistic picture of a more positive environment over the next handful of years. I believe that this recovery for the industry has resulted in a slower-than-normal rebound that one would expect. And I think we're seeing that in the data. But again, we also look at, I think, another broad leading indicator that tries to capture all that. It's the Dodge Momentum Index. And you're starting to see very nice, positive lift there. So for us, lighting is kind of the last stuffing on new construction projects. And our expectation is we get out into the 2014 and '15 time period, you're going to start to see new construction create a positive lift for the industry and, of course, Acuity.","Operator","The next question comes from Josh Baribeau of Canaccord.","Josh Baribeau - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","This is Josh for Jed. Vern, can you talk a lot about what you're seeing, if you're seeing anything, in terms of disruption or turnover in your agency channel?","Vernon J. Nagel","Acuity has, by far and away, the #1 agency for us in North America. And there's no one that's even close to that. And so, for us, the average tenure of our agency force being associated with Acuity is 27 or 28 years. We've had virtually no turnover. I mean, in the last, certainly, 24 months, I can only think of one agency where they have left us. We've had a few upgrades in the agency network mutually agreed. But for us, the agency turnover is not an issue.","Josh Baribeau - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Okay. And what about the competitive environment of your agents per se relative to some of the other agents today? Are they gaining share? Are they maintaining the share? How is that dynamic playing down -- playing out downstream?","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes. I would say that the Acuity agent continues to get stronger. And that's a relative term to the markets they serve. But as you know, that is very, very specific to each geography, each location. Acuity is represented by approximately 90 agents throughout the U.S. and Canada. And so one market to the next, the dynamics there are -- can be very, very different. But overall, I would say that the Acuity agent representing the fulsomeness of the Acuity platform is that they have been gaining share. By definition, they have to be gaining share because we are.","Josh Baribeau - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Got you. And just one more, if I may, and I might have missed this. Did you talk about your fixed component in terms of the dollar value of the SD&A this quarter?","Vernon J. Nagel","No, but I can comment on that. Fixed SD&A, for all of those who may recall, we said would kind of be in the range of 92 to 95. It's not precisely fixed. And this quarter, we were at the low end of that range. As we continue to make investments, I would expect that range for us to be kind of at the higher end, particularly as we drive eldoLED and its capabilities into the marketplace, not only for our own internal use, but for OEM customers as well. My guess is that would probably be at the higher end of that range, when we finally look at all of 2014.","Operator","The next question comes from Christopher Glynn with Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","I had a question, Vern. You mentioned the 1.7 million SKUs now over double historical. Just wondering if we could explore kind of the implications of that competitively in terms of what your thoughts might be on global scalability versus, clearly, the North American market itself seems to have plenty of opportunity.","Vernon J. Nagel","We are very bullish on the North American market, particularly as we look out, not just over 1 or 2 years, but over the next decade. The North American market, broadly the electrical industry and then more narrowly define the lighting industry, we believe will invest in technology and our capabilities that have paybacks associated with it. Lighting is the low hanging fruit. And the more investments that we make in our portfolio, the more investments that we make in our access to market and the quality of the folks that we have there, it represents, I think, a unique and exciting future for Acuity. So this is why we continue to make these investments. And if you will, retool the organization to be much more focused on integrated holistic lighting solutions for applications, like schools and hospitals and things of this nature, where we can actually sell to the customer a better quality of life and better solution that's paid for through energy savings. So this is why the proliferation of our SKUs, we are very good at managing that process. We have an excellent supply chain capability that allows us to deliver those -- that huge portfolio in a very cost-effective way. So I'm excited about what we're doing here in North America. And I'll turn it over to Ricky to make a comment or 2 on our international.","Richard K. Reece","Yes. And I would expand on, Vern, before I go to international. I think with this broad breadth of SKUs, not only in the luminaire side, but the control sides and some of the components, are enabling us to put together systems that others are having to cobble together from other outside partners instead of having that capability more in-house. And that could have huge implications. Internationally is an area that we do see opportunities. We're being pretty selective. Where we're focusing on that, we obviously have a footprint in Europe, and we're looking to improve our performance there. Obviously, there's been a huge economic crisis throughout much of Europe, particularly Spain, where we have one of our facilities. But we do see opportunities beginning to emerge there, as we build out our product capability and broaden our product portfolio. The other area of focus is in Latin America. Continue to see good growth opportunities there. We're #1 in Mexico in terms of luminaire sales and believe we can leverage some of the capabilities that we have into Latin America. Brazil, being probably the most prominent example, where we're getting some local manufacturing capability with the contract manufacturer to be able to service that region better. Beyond that, we are seeing opportunities to follow some of the global large companies where they go. And they like the opportunity to bring partners with them as they expand around the globe, provided they can service them well, both with the product, as well as the service capabilities. So we're building out that capability, have added resources there to be able to serve some of these large global, industrial, retail, other type of companies as they build out around the world and are looking for partners to follow them.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","And then just on the acquisition pipeline, wondering if you could comment on how full or active that is and some color on the range of properties and availability.","Vernon J. Nagel","Chris, the pipeline is very full. It's very active. But as you know, deals have to be both doable as well as desirable. And we've focused on those that are very desirable as part of our strategy. But at the end of the day, sometimes doability is -- it needs to be controlled. Sometimes sellers' expectations are beyond what we think is reasonable. And so we're very disciplined about what we will acquire in line, at what price points and it has to be integral to the strategies. So today, we have more cash than debt. It's an enviable situation. But we are -- we continue to look at acquisitions that make sense for us. So obviously, we'd like to put that capital to work in the most shareholder friendly way. We are very focused on delivering solid returns for our shareholders. So we just won't really nearly buy something simply because someone wants to sell something.","Operator","The next question comes from Winnie Clark of UBS.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Could you first comment on your outlook for CapEx for the year? I think you mentioned you expect to spend roughly $50 million this year. That's a bit of an increase from 2014, which I've heard -- excuse me, '13, which was elevated by a couple of items, like production line transfers and tooling for new product.","Richard K. Reece","Sure. If you look at the $50 million, we're looking at our 2 percentage of revenue type of range of what we're looking at. We're looking to do a little over $2 million this year in revenue. In the year, we just finished just over $2 billion of revenues. So we're looking in that 1.5% to 2% of revenue. That is at the upper end of that range, may even exceed that range slightly. A big driver of that is as we continue to build out our components' capability and are looking to add to our surface mount capabilities. So we're adding quite a bit of equipment in that range, as well as continuing to build out the new products that Vern was talking about, the tooling and all associated with that. So I would say it's in building out our manufacturing capability and components and then a little higher tuning that may cause us to be at the upper end or potentially above that 2% of revenue, but the 1.5% to 2% is what we kind of target.","Vernon J. Nagel","And Ricky, if I could just comment as well. I want to be very clear. We are investing in new aspects of the business that we typically would not have participated in, say, 2008. We believe that there are opportunities, again, use the eldoLED acquisition, for us to build out a capability and a platform where we are selling integrated holistic lighting systems, where it's plug-and-play. It works together. And so we believe, for us, the ability to control some of the internal components is an opportunity to bring even more value. As Ricky pointed out earlier, folks who don't have this capability have to go out and partner with others, and now you're getting a type of margin stacking, as well as challenges of communicating around this holistic system in a way where we believe some of these investments will give us a unique capability. So what you're seeing at both in 2013, part of the acquisition strategy, and even before. It started when we first acquired Sensor Switch. We're building out that capability, which is unique to Acuity and a huge opportunity on a go-forward basis. You don't have to do that. You could have just continued to be a designer and integrator -- designer of light fixtures and an integrator of component. But we see much, much more interesting capability to tie into building management systems and do all this. That's different than -- slightly different than what we would have done before. Hence, the slightly higher incremental spend on capital. But we believe that the returns will be robust, again, over the next, I'm going to say, decade around these kinds of things.","Winifred Clark - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","That's very helpful. And to touch a little bit more on the product development side. I mean, clearly, you've been very focused on that and it's been a strong contributor to revenue growth. Can you provide some color on what percentage of sales are driven by new products potentially? And specifically, what level of spending you engage in, in terms of new product development.","Vernon J. Nagel","So last quarter, I gave some flavor around new product development. The GAAP or SEC methodology of capturing R&D. For us, R&D is a very small number. But if you look at the internal capabilities that we have, and we capture this in our SD&A expenses, the amount of investment that we make to create design and create test products for the marketplace, it's a formidable number. I mean, it's a double-digit as a percentage of sale number. So that is the key and core strength of Acuity, that deep knowledge around that. When we look at our product vitality, interestingly, because we are so large and we look at the various channels that we sell through, we're looking more at channel-specific capabilities. So our product vitality can be anywhere from 10% to 30%, depending on the channel and the type of products that we're talking about. It's very exciting. Very exciting.","Operator","The next question comes from Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I just had 2 questions. With regards to the revenue growth the last couple of quarters, the outperformance has been pretty significant, with the market as a whole being mid-singles. Is this something that you think is sustainable at this point, given the order activity you're seeing and the potential project activity you're seeing? Is there anything -- and I know you don't give formal guidance for '14, but is there any reason to believe, with comparisons getting a little more challenging particularly moving to the second half of next year, that, that should be a cause of concern at least from a growth rate standpoint?","Vernon J. Nagel","So Rich, our view is -- well, like our competitors, we're after every single order. They are as well. We've been able to gain share leverage. Again, product portfolio, access to market, true value, if you will. Our objective is to continue to outperform the markets that we serve. And if we really pay attention to how we differentiate at the customer level, our expectation is that we will deliver on that. And I'm very pleased with the work that we're doing to improve our cost structure. And so I would expect us to continue to see, at the operating profit level, improvements. Volume is important. So one quarter to the next is a little bit difficult to always judge precisely. But when you look at the full year, I would expect us to continue to, again, outperform the markets we serve in terms of top line growth. And we are maniacally focused on delivering that incremental growth in terms of sales, the variable contribution to our bottom line for our shareholders.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","So it sounds like fundamentally, you're not seeing anything that would cause you not to be able to grow in terms of outperforming the market with the level that you have been recently.","Vernon J. Nagel","I'm not going to say that we will always outperform the market as we have recently all the time quarter in and quarter out. Again, we don't give guidance around that. But we put in place what we consider to be a robust strategy that should allow us to outperform the markets and will let that whole notion of outperformance be what it is when we deliver it. It's just -- I'm not going to comment precisely on whether it's going to be this percentage or that percentage. We're focused on delivering performance.","Richard Michael Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's -- it's fair. And then just on the -- Ricky, on the savings, the $15 million savings, I know a chunk of that is going to be redeployed. Can you give us a sense of actually what's going to drop to the bottom line? If I recall from last quarter, it didn't sound like there was a whole lot that's going to be dropped into the bottom line. Most of that's going to be redeployed. Is that still the right assumption to make as we think about margins in '14?","Richard K. Reece","Again, to echo Vern's comment, we don't give guidance. So I'm not going to be as specific in answering your question. But you're right, we are looking, particularly with wage inflation, the health care increases that are going to consume some of these productivity gains and streamlining savings. We always are looking at ways to offset increases in those types of costs. We are continuing to build out our marketing and sales capability to service these solutions and systems that we are selling. And as Vern has been commenting, we're starting to see real good returns on that from the revenue growth and so forth. So I'm not going to be able to give you a specific example. But you're right. We will be continuing to invest in the business as we have in these growth initiatives and some of the savings from the streamlining, obviously, will help offset those increases.","Vernon J. Nagel","And Ricky, as we pointed out, if you look at the sequential third quarter to fourth quarter, our variable contribution on that sales increase was about 32%. So we'd like to be clear to our shareholder base. We are very focused on driving positive incremental margins on that incremental dollar of sale.","Operator","The next question comes from Peter Lisnic, Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Vern, I guess, first question. If I look at the price mix impact in the fourth quarter, that headwind decelerated from what we saw in the second and third. So around 300 bps or so, a little bit less, I guess, in the second, third. Now we're, call it 100, 125 basis points. So something -- it looks like it firmed there or mix change. Can you give us a little more color as to why we saw that headwind abate a bit here in the fourth quarter?","Vernon J. Nagel","You did, no issue on that. Again, when I look at price mix, even compared to the third quarter, it was down. Again, I believe that we're seeing now a more consistent play. We're starting to see a little bit more positive mix on the product side. E&I was up compared with the overall average. We did some excellent work on our cost structure within some of our growing channels, like infrastructure. So we saw some favorability there. And my sense is, is that when we start to look at 2014 compared to 2013, the mix change. And again, I want to be, because I don't know exactly what it's going to be. But our expectation is, is that the mix should become more favorable as new construction starts to come about, and then some of the work that we've done on cost savings starts to benefit or come through as a benefit.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. And can you draw out any pricing inferences from what you're seeing so far? In other words, does that headwind abatement suggest that maybe a firming demand that the pricing landscape has gotten a little bit more -- strengthened a bit more relative to previous quarters?","Vernon J. Nagel","No. We can't infer that. In fact, we have some channels where pricing continues to be brutal. I mean, to the point where we may actually even say no to some things because we just can't get the cost structure and the investment structure right to give us the kinds of returns that we want. Now I want to be clear about this. We still expect to grow. We still expect to grow in all of our channels. International is still a bit of a challenge. But I don't think you can infer that pricing in the various channels has changed. Our expectation is, is that pricing, on a go-forward basis, really will have more do with the type of project, the breadth of portfolio that you offer into that projects. So we would almost consider that to be a mix issue, not a price issue.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay. All right, got it. And then, second question I guess just on if you can update, as I may have missed this, but your residential exposure, give us a sense of scale there. And then are there opportunities to make that a more meaningful piece of the portfolio or would it even be something that would be considered a strategic initiative at Acuity?","Vernon J. Nagel","So residential is a strategic initiative in Acuity. Again, we continue to look at potential acquisitions to help facilitate that. But my guess is that, that won't happen. And so our focus is to continue to greenfield and leverage our access to the residential markets through a number of different channels. Our portfolio there continues to grow nicely. Resi, probably a few years ago, resi was 10% of our business. It's very difficult to precisely calculate because, again, we sell products that can be used either in resi or light nonresidential construction. And in those channels, we don't know where it ends up. But if we had to guess, we've improved our resi share by probably a couple of 100 bps. But again, difficult to precisely know. The products that would be resi-oriented, we're seeing very solid growth there, above market growth for residential as a whole. So we believe that, that's an indication of us gaining share because of the product and future differentiation.","Operator","I would like to turn it back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will, over the longer term, deliver on the expectations of our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","Thank you for participating in today's conference. You may disconnect at this time."],"486":["Acuity Brands, Inc.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you. Good morning. With me today to discuss our third quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risk and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions.","First off our results for the third quarter of 2015 were simply outstanding. Our net sales grew over 13%, while our adjusted earnings per share grew 37%. Net sales, gross profit margin and our adjusted results for operating profit, net income and earnings per share were all quarterly records for Acuity.","In addition, this was the ninth quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth. We believe these results are yet again strong evidence of our strategies to provide customers with differentiated, value-added solutions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to further extend our leadership position in North America.","These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy efficient lighting solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity.","Our adjusted profitability for the third quarter was a record for Acuity, even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio affording us a huge opportunity to be a critical component of the backbone for enabling the internet of things.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.","Net sales for the third quarter were $684 million, an increase of more than 13% compared with the year-ago period. On a GAAP basis, our diluted earnings per share was $1.48, up 47% from the year ago period.","As Ricky will explain later in the call, we had some minor adjustments to operating profit in both periods as well as a pre tax benefit of $10.5 million or $0.15 diluted per share in the third quarter of 2015 resulting from a net gain associated with financial instruments that hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the previously announced acquisition of Canadian based Distech Controls.","I find it helpful to add back these adjustments to both quarter results as well as exclude the net gain in the current quarter to make the quarter\u2019s results comparable.","Adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2015 was $100.9 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $71.8 million in the year ago period, an increase of almost 41%. Adjusted operating profit margin for this quarter was a robust 14.8% up 290 basis points from the adjusted margin reported in the year ago period.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a quarterly record of $1.37 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of a $1 in the year ago period up 37%, strong quarterly results indeed.","Lastly as Ricky will discuss later, we meaningfully enhanced our already strong financial position this quarter as we now have more than $650 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, far exceeding our debt of slightly more than $350 million.","These results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon on further analysis.","While net sales for the quarter grew over 13% compared with a year ago, we estimate our sales volume was up more than 14%. This growth was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency primarily the Canadian Dollar.","The impact of price mix was not significant this quarter. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes, we believe the ongoing decline in certain LED component prices this quarter was offset by a more favorable mix of product sold.","The increase in net sales was broadbased along most product lines, channels, geographies and verticals. Our sales growth this quarter was primarily due to our continued focus on projects from new construction and renovation in both the nonresidential and residential markets as well as continued emphasis on selling higher value added lighting solutions, especially LED-based luminaires where sales of our LED products grew by 55% this quarter compared with the year ago period, an extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for 46% of our total sales, which as you know include non-fixture related lighting products.","We believe our growth rate for LED luminaires continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products demonstrating our market-leading prowess.","Excluding LED luminaires and components, we believe the puts and takes for product pricing were again fairly benign this quarter. Looking at market conditions for the third quarter, we believe that North American lighting market was up mid to high single digits during the quarter. This was in contrast with the growth rates of our net sales in North America, which was up more than 14%.","Lastly, we believe our channel, product and vertical diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted third quarter operating profit was a quarterly record of $100.9 million, a robust 14.8% of net sales up 290 basis points from the adjusted margin reported in the year ago period.","Our gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 43.2%, up 290 basis points compared with the year-ago period. The expansion of our gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales, productivity improvements and lower material costs, partially offset by unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates primarily for the Canadian Dollar.","Next, adjusted total selling, distribution and administrative expenses were up $23.1 million or a little more than 13% similar to the increase in net sales. Adjusted SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales this quarter were essentially flat compared with the prior at 28.5%.","The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher commission expense to support the increase in net sales and higher employee related cost, including incentive compensation and continued investments necessary to drive our tiered solution strategy.","These higher cost were partially offset by past streamlining efforts and productivity gains. This next point is very important.","Another way to view just how robust our third quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin for adjusted operating profit and the increase in net sales. In doing so, one can see our adjusted variable contribution margin and the incremental sales of $80 million was over 36%. All in all we had another great quarter.","On a strategic front, we continue to make great strides setting the stage for what we believe will be strong profitability growth for the balance of 2015 and beyond.","From a product and lighting solutions development perspective, we continued our rapid pace of new introductions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions.","As we had noted in the past, we offer customers more than $1.7 million SKUs to choose from, more than three times as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio, including controls.","As I mentioned earlier, our LED sales for the third quarter grew 55% compared with the year ago period, far outpacing the growth rates of our largest competitors. ","We continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solution strategy. The purpose of this strategy is to lever our incredibly diverse portfolio by offering customer solutions that best meet their needs whether it would be a single device or a complete holistic integrated lighting solution for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are in smart and simple, both to install and to use. This is a compelling and powerful value proposition for our customers.","While sales information for our tiered solutions is still in precise and expanding off a small base, we believe our sales were up significantly again on a year-over-year basis in these key categories.","To fully execute this strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources along each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' applications.","More impressively, our adjusted operating profit margin continued to expand this quarter compared with the year ago period, while sales of LED-based solutions have now become the majority portion of our fixture sales.","Acuity is a clear leader in providing customers with superior lighting solutions, incorporating either conventional or solid-state light sources. The market has come to understand that LED as a light source is no longer a new technology.","Now widely accepted, the attention of the customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits including energy-saving and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of things.","Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, we believe we are growing significantly faster than the markets we serve.","As I have noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during eras of technology disruption and that is even more true today.","As part of our tiered solution strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. We're leveraging our deep customer knowledge, our unmatched access to market in a broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor solid-state and traditional energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls to bring truly differentiated value to customers, and we're delivering profitable growth and strong financial returns for our shareholders while making important investments, including acquisitions and strategic alliances to broaden our capabilities to serve customers.","As we noted last quarter, we expect the pending acquisition of Distech Controls as well as the strategic partnership with Sensity Systems to help drive our tiered solution strategy, particularly as it relates to our holistic approach towards the advancements of smart buildings and smart cities.","Distech based outside Montr\u00e9al, Canada, is a leading provider of building automation and energy management solutions that allow for the seamless integration of lighting, HVAC, access control, closed-circuit television and related systems.","We expect the combination of Acuity with our broad based industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions and Distech to contribute to our tiered solution strategy, by offering true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building including enhanced occupant experience, quality visual environment, seamless operational energy efficiency and operational cost reductions and increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data to better enable the internet of things for building owners.","Distech, while relatively small today with 2014 annual sales of approximately CA$70 million, would enhance our tiered solution strategy going forward as we enable smart buildings.","As Ricky will explain later, we now expect this transaction, which is subject to Distech shareholder approval as well as other customary and closing conditions to close in September. We will have more to say about this once the transaction is complete.","We expect the strategic opportunities such as these, coupled with our internal efforts to allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new commercial construction cycle.","We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication resolve of over more than 7,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2015. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern and good morning, everyone.","Vern covered the primary drivers for our third quarter sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items. I will provide a bit more color on our quarter's results and financial position as well as our pending acquisition of Distech.","I will begin my prepared comments by providing a brief update on our streamlining activities. We recorded a modest $0.4 million pretax special charge associated with our previously announced streamlining activities related to production transfer cost.","We currently expect to incur addition production transfer expenses and other costs associated with these streamlining actions totaling approximately $1.3 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. This will result in a total special charge for fiscal year 2015 of approximately $11.2 million.","We plan to reinvest a portion of these savings and additional growth initiatives, which will require Acuity adding new talent with different skill sets. However, during the first nine months of fiscal 2015, we've realized savings over and above these reinvestments that are approximately equal to the amount of this year's total streamlining cost.","As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAPP results in both quarter of fiscal 2015 and 2014, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be more comparable.","In the third quarter of fiscal 2015, we added back pre tax $1.3 million or $0.03 per diluted EPS for acquisition related professional fees associated with the pending Distech acquisition, which is a non-tax deductible expense and pre-tax $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS for special charges related to our streamlining efforts, which I discussed previously.","In addition, we adjusted our third quarter 2015 results by $10.5 million pre-tax or $0.15 per diluted EPS for the net gain associated with the financial instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the pending acquisition or Canadian based Distech controls.","Adjusted results for the third quarter of last year excluded the benefit of a pre-tax $0.8 million or $0.01 per diluted EPS recovery related to a fiscal 2013 loss resulting from a fraud perpetrated by a former freight service provider.","In our earnings release and our Form 10-Q, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 36% compared with 32.2% in the third quarter of last year. The prior year effective tax rate benefited from favorable adjustments to certain income tax reserves, which did not recur in the current year.","We still expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2015 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","Cash flow generated from operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2015 was an impressive $158.2 million, which is a $29.4 million increase over the prior year.","For the nine months ended May 31, 2015, we spend $42.3 million on capital expenditures compared with $24.8 million in the prior year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2015.","This expected uptick in capital expenditures compared with recent prior years is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including the expansion in our production capacity to support our increased volume along with the build-out of our innovation and technology center in Metro Atlanta as well as expenditures related to certain projects that were delayed from the prior fiscal year.","At May 31, 2015, we had a cash and cash equivalents balance of $652 million, an increase of $100 million since August 31, 2014. Our total debt was $354 million. Consequently, our cash exceeded debt at the end of the fiscal quarter.","At May 31, 2015, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million under our credit facility. We clearly have significant financial strength and flexibility and we will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","I will conclude with some additional comments on the pending Distech acquisition. On March 9, we announced that we had entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of Distech. The terms of the agreement reflect a cash purchase price totaling CA$318 million or approximately US$255 million, which we intend to fund using cash on hand.","Because of significant volatility in the U.S. and Canadian dollar exchange rates over the last year or so, we thought it was prudent to enter into a foreign currency contract in an effort to mitigate nearly all of the foreign currency exposures associated with the Canadian dollar purchase price, because U.S. GAAP does not allow a hedge of a commitment to acquire our business to receive hedge accounting treatment, a net pre-tax gain on these contracts totaling $10.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share was recognized in net miscellaneous income for the third quarter of fiscal 2015.","On June 30, 2015, the company entered into another foreign currency forward contract. As we explained further in the Form 10-Q, which was filed earlier today, Distech has identified certain prior transactions involving shipments of standard commercial building control products that may constitute violations of U.S. and Canadian sanctions on export regulations.","The shareholders of Distech have jointly agreed to indemnify Acuity for damages in respect of potential violations or any inaccuracies or breach of the representations made by Distech to Acuity related to this matter up to a specified aggregated amount.","These indemnity obligations will be supported by an escrow account containing proceeds from the transaction equal to the specified aggregate amount. The company currently believes that this indemnity will be sufficient to cover any damages related to potential violations and any related cost and expenses and any associated remedial actions.","The company does not expect this matter to have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, cash flow or results of operation of the company. The company delayed the closing of this transaction while we reviewed Distech's investigation of these issues and their potential impact and while we address the associated identification that I just mentioned.","The closing of this proposed transaction is subject to approval by certain Distech shareholders and other closing conditions, which we expect to successfully conclude. We remain excited about the opportunity presented by this transaction. We expect to complete the acquisition of Distech in September 2015.","Distech generated net sales in excess of CA$70 million during calendar year 2014 and enjoyed a five-year annual growth rate of over 25%. Almost half of Distech sales are in the U.S., about a third in Europe, less than 10% in Canada and the remainder spread broadly around the rest of the world.","The operating profit margin of Distech is similar to Acuity. We will provide additional details following the completion of this transaction.","Thank you and I\u2019ll now turn the call back to you, Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky.","As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term profitable growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving, particularly for Acuity. Our growth expectations for the lighting industry primarily in North America has not really changed much over the last several quarters. We remain very positive.","So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide you with some observations for the balance of 2015. First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest but increasing pace.","While forecast for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North American is expected to grow mid to upper single digit range for 2015, reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity.","Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the longer term future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for North American market such as the architectural billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption and lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve, while residential construction continues to grow nicely.","As this becomes the norm over the last handful of years, we're always leery of the next round of uncertainty that might come out of Washington as well as fiscal and foreign policy issues. As you know, the manner in how these key issues are resolved can meaningfully influence business and consumer confidence.","Nonetheless, we continue to expect that the overall demand in our end markets for our fourth quarter and into fiscal 2016 will continue to improve and be more broad-based and consistent than that experienced over the last few years. The continued favorable trend in our June order rate again seems to support this continuing level of improvement.","Second, excluding the price of certain LED components, which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input cost for our fourth quarter as some commodity cost have waned while others continue to rise.","Further we expect employee related cost to continue to increase as we invest in people skills necessary to execute our teared solution strategy, wage inflation, higher incentive compensation and the negative impact of rising healthcare cost.","Next we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are impossible to predict. To help offset these higher costs, we continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture as well as furthering our efforts to drive productivity improvements to help deliver continued favorable variable contribution margin and incrementally higher sales.","Another observation, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, price, product and sales channel mix as well as innovation, we expect our annual growth profit margin to improve over time as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix particularly as we execute our tiered solution sales strategy and as we continue to realize typical gains and manufacturing efficiencies.","Our gross profit margin improvement in the third quarter was a good example of our potential, but we prefer to look at our marginal improvement over 12-month periods to remove quarterly anomalies to discern proper trends. You should do the same. It is a positive picture.","Additionally, we continue -- while we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly and most importantly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the introduction of holistic lighting solutions that for example connect smart lighting to smartphones for retailers as well as our growing electronic component capabilities.","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, while our strategy is to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy is really the next step in the evolution of our overall growth strategy.","This includes expected benefits from the pending acquisition of Distech, which we believe will menaingfull expand our addressable market as well as add much greater opportunities to offer customers even more broad based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their buildings.","Our company-wide strategy is straightforward, expanding leverage of our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio; coupled with the existence -- our existence, excuse me, market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns.","This all takes focus and resources. We are aligning our resources and continuing to make additional investments in certain areas today, because we see great opportunity for future profitable growth. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our record growth supports this view.","As I have said before, we believe the lighting solutions industry along with the broader electrical industry, including the market for building management systems will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of things.","We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years providing us with significant growth potential.","As the North American market leader, we are positioned to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from Jed Dorsheimer with Canaccord.","Jed Dorsheimer","Hi, thanks and congratulations on the margin increase. Vern, I was wondering -- my first question is just on the tiered solution and specifically if you could look at -- if we could look at what we're seeing in California is indicative to the rest of our the country.","If you've been able to discern your tiered approach with respect to Title 24 and how that business is going and would you be able to provide us with some updates in terms of where that is at and then overall as a percentage of sales?","Vern Nagel","Sure. Jed, it's really too early for us to provide great detail around the specific tiers. If you imagine Tier 1 as being just simple devices migrating to Tier 3 where there are now integrated holistic solutions. Some of our record keeping in the past we really didn't look at the market place that way.","As we look at our portfolio today and structure our portfolio more and more around these Tiers, we are seeing growth that is meaningfully above even our strong growth rate that you see today and it is because customers are looking more and more for that smart and simple turnkey solution.","This is why we're particularly excited by the pending acquisition of Distech because it allows us to really provide even more total end to end capabilities to customers.","You had mentioned California. I think California is a harbinger of real positive things to come as energy and conservation comes to the forefront of people thinking. When we look at what we are doing in certain geographies in terms of year-over-year growth, it is favorable. We don't provide the absolute detail around that, but it is meaningfully higher than the overall growth rate.","So our expectation is that as we look out over the next\u2026","\u2026So our expectation is that as we look out over the next handful of years and beyond as more and more of both regulation as well as just great business practices come to the forefront, these are energy saving, cost saving opportunities and this is why we think we are uniquely positioned to help drive that with our tiered solution strategy.","We will continue to provide more detail as we go forward as it becomes if you will more known. We still have issues around how we collect data and information around that to make it truly actionable. So, at this point in time, we're not going to provide really specifics around it because it's still a bit of an estimate.","Jed Dorsheimer","Okay. Fair enough. Just with respect to mix and actually distribution in the segment of -- or the breakdown of your sales, when you refer to the benefit in terms of gross margin, is it just in the agent side of the business that you've seen a larger proportion of sizable contracts this quarter, or is there something -- was there another move within that mix that benefited the margins this quarter?","Vern Nagel","That\u2019s a great question. The key elements benefiting our gross profit margin improvement were primarily increases in volume and you saw that very nice growth 14% volume growth, material cost opportunities and benefits there as well as continued productivity of our supply chain.","Our supply chain team is just doing an outstanding job of improving their cost structure as well as providing superior service for our customers. When we look at verticals, we continue to see favorability really along all verticals.","Healthcare grew nicely for us. Education grew nicely for us. Infrastructure, street and roadway grew nicely for us and we continue to see benefits through renovation.","So I would say that what happened with the mix this quarter is not necessarily a lot more larger products but are projects, excuse me, but opportunities to serve these verticals in just a more favorable way. So still waiting for if you will the opportunities and the benefits of larger projects coming through.","We believe that as we look out into our market place, we discuss opportunities with our channel partners whether it\u2019s the specification community, our electrical contractor partners, our electrical distributors partners, we believe that there is a lot of favorability out there that will manifest itself over the next easily three years because we can see that, but the trends are very favorable even beyond.","So we are optimistic about where our markets will go and really optimistic about how we've positioned ourselves to capitalizing on that. We are really in the early innings of all this.","Jed Dorsheimer","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Tim Weiss with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Weiss","Hey guys. Good morning. I guess just a follow-up on the price mix question from before. Just any color behind how you guys are seeing new construction and retrofit come through? Is there any benefit right now that's coming through price mix from an improvement in new construction and is that something that's in the early innings in your view?","Vern Nagel","In our view, it\u2019s still very much in the early innings. As we look at again the difference between renovation and new construction if a specifier is involved in the renovation frankly it look like new construction to us, but it\u2019s really a different segment. So we're trying to get better analytics around that to understand where our markets are going.","When it goes through our electrical distributor partners often where there is not a specifier involved, its product type. So we have pretty good track record around that and frankly I believe that\u2019s our internal capabilities that have helped influence mostly our gross profit margin improvement. We like what\u2019s happening with the mix. We've actually kind of annualized some of this.","We work hard to offset some of the channel mix. We have certain channels where pricing and the margin dynamics are a little different when you compare one to another channel. But overall, our cash flow return on investment off of those types of channels is usually quite favorable.","In fact, when we look at our trailing 12 months cash flow return on investment as a company, we're now above 30%, which is just really a pretty extraordinary achievement.","Tim Weiss","No, that's great. I guess my follow-up question just a clarification on some of the prepared remarks around the market growth, it's been mid to high single digits from the last couple of quarters last few years here and I just wanted to clarify, it sounded like it could get better and maybe more broad-based as we look into fiscal '16.","So I guess what are the drivers you think specifically that could drive that improvement and is it possible that you could see a lighting market and underlying lighting market that actually gets into double-digit growth territory?","Vern Nagel","That's not necessarily what the prognosticators say. We don't consider ourselves to be economists. So we use information from Dodge and global insights and NEMA and NAM and other places to really help us understand what they're forecasting and then we contrast that with our really voice of the market our sales people interfacing with the various people who we work with.","And when you look at things like architectural billing index and you talk with architects lighting designers and engineers, they're busy and they're growing their business and usually is a leading indicator of what ultimately will happen in the larger market that even when working on renovation projects because lighting and energy management systems really do provide a very robust payback.","And so most businesses seem to be flushed with cash and so they're looking for ways to optimize their returns. They're certainly not getting at by leaving in, in the bank and so lighting and building management systems provide companies with the opportunity to not only enhance their environment, but to get really good return off of it.","So I am not going to go out on the limb and say I see a double-digit growth in sort of the non-residential construction market, but I think the prognosticators are telling you that it's getting very close to being in that upper single digit when you think about '16 and '17.","Our opportunity we believe is to again outperform those types of growth rates as we have really for quite some time now.","Tim Weiss","You guys have done a great job. Thanks for the additional color.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","Hey guys, thanks for taking the questions. I guess first one I had was just around some recent data points around the LED cycle that suggest and it's consistent with some of your commentary. Pricing on components is seeing faster than expected decline this year in recent times.","I know historically, you passed on most of these declines, but wondering what impact you may be seeing or you might see here in the near term given not only the increased pricing pressure on the supply chain for those components, but also what I believe is a mix shift for you guys specifically to more suppliers and lower cost alternatives in Asia versus what you may have been sourcing in the past. So any color there will be helpful.","Vern Nagel","Sure. I don't know that LED component prices are declining any faster than the market anticipated. I think it's been a normal decline. Actually in some areas one could argue that the price decline is slowing a tad.","Most all of our business if you will is a bid business. So our objective is to really create a value proposition around our solution set that is not really a cost plus, but is really what is the value of that, that total holistic solution and that's why we've really are starting to migrate towards a tiered solutions approach, so we can really differentiate the features and benefits of our products and solutions amongst those tiers.","And that allows us from what we're seeing to extract a bit more margin as we sell more effectively. So I believe that LED component cost will continue to decline. The market generally is passing that back to the consumer.","I don't see that trend materially changing, but from Acuity's perspective, we will continue to drive our tiered solution strategy where we're actually creating a difference for those holistic solutions because the energy savings and the other features and benefits that the building owner or building user would get, whether it's a better visual environment, whether it's the internet of things, it's more friendly user ability.","All these things are hugely important in creating the difference, which we think over time will help us not only gain share, but improve our margin profile.","Brian Lee","Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful. Second question was just around the sort of a higher level snapshot of what's happening in your competitive landscape if you look at the reshuffling at some of your traditional peers like Phillips and Osram.","I wonder is that creating opportunities for you or has that been creating opportunities for you and may be the share gains you might be seeing from this? How do you view those in terms of the stickiness? Is that a permanent shift in share that you might be taking advantage of, any thoughts there? Thanks,","Vern Nagel","Sure. I believe that the competitive landscape, the two names that you mentioned I mean the bigger shift for them is exiting the lamp balance side of the business, not really the fixture. Osram is not a material player in the fixture side of the business here in North America.","Certainly Phillips is and I don't see really a change in their approach to the market. They're an aggressive competitor. They sell traditionally on value. I think some of the other competitors that are out there that have attempted to enter the market using primarily price as their point of differentiation have -- that model has been repudiated to a degree.","And so I don't see huge changes in the competitive dynamics from traditional players. We do see the opportunity and this is why we continue to look at alliances and opportunities to work with other technology based businesses because as we migrate from the analogue world to the digital world, now all of a sudden I mean frankly lighting as wherever people are and wherever there is lighting, there is power.","So now you're able to do so much more with this digital world and Acuity truly understands how to help drive these things. So you've seen announcements around the acquisition of Brightlight for example. That acquisition was to really help us drive our visible light communication capability that is not just for key retailers, but ultimately will be in many, many buildings.","So to sense around what's going to happen in the competitive landscape is our value proposition will proliferate and some of the traditional competitors won't really be playing there because it's now that how do you serve the building owner in terms of not only enhancing that visual environment, but enhancing the entire environment and using lighting as the backbone to collect information to help provide capability back so that they can optimize the management of the building.","What that means to us is that we will see probably new competitors or different competitors than we have in the past. We're very excited about it because the value proposition for these building owners is really quite significant and it doesn\u2019t matter whether it's retail or education or commercial office buildings or industrial, lighting is going to be a -- from Acuity anyway, a critical backbone in how the building is operated.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group","Kathryn Thompson","Hi, thanks for taking my questions today. Firstly -- we attended Light Fair this year. You had said that the most exciting thing about your business is the Internet of Things, which you've talked about on today's call. So in other words, connecting a variety of devices in an everyday environment over the Internet.","Just as you over the past several quarters have been able to outline LED as a percentage of your total sales, could you -- over the next two or three years, are you able to either quantify or envision how much of your business, your total business, will be more tech versus device and what does this mean from a margin profile standpoint? Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Sure. Kathryn that goes back to Jed's question earlier. It's really our tiered solution strategy approach and as we get a better base of data and our ability to more effectively collect that information, particularly as we think about these holistic solutions and how they come together.","Again building owners will care less and less about the pieces and parts. What they will care about is do all of these things work together. Are they smart and are they simple for me to use and can I use them in a way that helps me optimize with whatever I am doing.","If it's a retailer, can I optimize my associate\u2026","\u2026I am doing. If it\u2019s a retailer, can I optimize my associate productivity or enhance the retail environment for consumers. If I am university, can I make my university safer and so on and so forth? I believe that we will be able to give better information around our tiered solutions strategy as we go forward.","It\u2019s just that we are in our infancy. We're trying to slice and dice the historical data so that we can have a base with which to compare. We're working hard to create the portfolios internally that will then allow us to sell those as holistic solutions and we will be able to record those. It\u2019s rough right now. It\u2019s really a guesstimate.","But when we look at that, when we look at the data that we have, it tells a compelling story and when we think about the hit rate that we have when we tell folks who are interested in these holistic solution, their interest and what they're focusing on and the opportunity to look at it as a total cost of ownership is very robust.","And our hypothesis is that we will see more improved margin profile from those kinds of thing. But it\u2019s really early in the game favorable trends, but we will be able to do that probably down the road certainly not over the next couple of quarters though.","Kathryn Thompson","Okay. So it\u2019s too early to quantify effectively.","Vern Nagel","Yes.","Kathryn Thompson","That's helpful. Second question, how much of your top-line growth do you think is more driven by the cycle versus secular drivers?","Vern Nagel","Ricky, I\u2019ll turn that over to you. Our growth rate is above the market growth rates that we're experiencing. As you all know, lighting lags right. So while leading indicators are like such as architecture billing index they can see.","Kathryn Thompson","And we're also seeing in some of our survey work, for instance, fuel starts and aggregates, which are early indicators, are right now seeing volume growth of 8% to 9% in that non-res sector. But I guess the point is did you see growth above and beyond what you are seeing in the current quarter because it is a lag product?","Vern Nagel","Correct and we also have the added benefit of renovation activity. Again it\u2019s a huge installed based that\u2019s out there and its been converting very slow as Acuity becomes better and better, fishing in that pond, we think it allows us to -- any components that will allow us to outgrow the overall growth rate of the markets.","I think that the mid to upper single digit range for lighting over the last quarter is probably closer to upper is probably a fair reflection of what the marketplace is and again we're collecting data Kathryn as you are from various sources to help us sort of triangulate but compute that and yet our growth rate continues to be above that.","Ricky Reece","I would add that Kathryn, if you look at our growth rate, clearly we're seeing the secular benefit of the moved LED. LEDs tend to sell at a higher price point per fixture than the traditional fixture So that\u2019s helping the industry and us from a top line growth.","That secular trend as Vern commented the renovation retrofit over the last several years just continues to accelerate. Obviously again the LED technology being a catalyst for that, but there is the desire to be green, desire to be sustainable, the energy savings regulations we've talked about California Title 24, other factors that are driving that.","And then as you mentioned, the cyclical I would say the minority of our growth now would be the cyclical recovery while we're seeing a recovery in nonresidential construction and may be a bit more in residential construction, I would say that's a minority of our growth versus the secular trend of moving to LED and this renovation retrofit opportunity of converting this very large install base.","We estimate the install base at over $300 billion indoor and then you add it all at the outdoor and all we have to do is drive around and look up and you recognize how few of the outdoor lights have converted to LED and similar when you look around in building.","So huge, huge opportunity and we're beginning to see that conversion rate pick up and that secular trend I think is a bigger driver of our growth for the industry and certainly for us. But we're seeing the cyclical recovery and as we've talked about and it\u2019s good to hear what you're seeing in other industries that will continue.","Kathryn Thompson","Great. Thanks so much for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is Sven Eenmaa with Stifel. Your line is open.","Sven Eenmaa","Great. Thanks for taking my question. Wanted to ask about when you think about around 6 to 12 months or so, how do you see a mix evolving versus new construction versus renovation activity and retrofit activity?","And also how big of a part of their mix you expect to be coming from again the stock and flow and then discrete item sales?","Vern Nagel","Sure. I think over the last year maybe 18 months, our view was that our business was probably 50-50 in new construction and renovation. Our expectation is that as new construction comes back, that mix will shift a little bit towards new construction.","But be clear we have become very skilled at fishing in that renovation pond. So we would expect to continue to see that grow as well. It's just that as Ricky pointed out some of the new construction activity may more, may shift that mix just a little bit.","So does it become 60-40 that it wouldn't surprise me, but we're going after it all in that regard and then remind me the second question was\u2026","Sven Eenmaa","In terms of whole -- in terms of discrete sales, discrete and then the stock and flow sales to distributors, how kind of the big part of the business mix you expect that to be going forward?","Vern Nagel","Sure. It may be different for Acuity than others because again of the renovation relation or the relationship that we have with our key electrical distributors around renovation. So that number is probably a two thirds, one third number.","We're just kind of guessing here a little bit, 70-30 something like that new versus stock inflow or I should say a more specification project business versus stock inflow. That would be my guess and truly it's a guess.","Sven Eenmaa","Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Ryan Merkel with William Blair.","Ryan Merkel","Great. Thanks for fitting me in. The first question I had was on SG&A, there wasn\u2019t a lot of leverage this quarter or even last quarter, but is it fair to expect some SG&A leverage in the fourth quarter and then also in 2016 and 2017?","Vern Nagel","Yes, I understand that SGA area we are a pay for performance environment and so the performance that the company is performing to today is really upper quartile performance and so the incentive compensation is upper quartile.","This quarter compared to the year ago quarter, we probably booked close to three times the amount of accrual for incentive compensation. When I think about the fourth quarter last year, we had a very solid fourth quarter and so the accrual was higher than it had been in the typical or the previous quarters because the performance was more consistent with a lower accrual number.","Anyway we earned the bonus last year accrued in the fourth quarter. My guess is that this year we'll see some of that leverage coming forward. In other words we won't be booking. We'll probably be booking a consistent number for incentive comp, but on a higher level of revenues.","The other thing that I would point out is we continue to reinvest back in the business. As we've talked about the tiered solutions approach, the investments that we're making to really drive capability in Tier 3 and Tier 4, peak skill sets and resources that we haven't had in the past and so we're investing there.","We took a streamlining action in the first quarter of this year and we've been adding back different skill sets to help us drive that. I think what's particularly important as the variable contribution margin that we earned this quarter, it was above what we would like to provide if you will sort of a directional capability variable contribution in the upper 20s is a number that we're comfortable with.","But yet we continue to outperform that or have outperformed that and our objective is to always do that. So you will see leverage in the SDA are as we go forward. Certainly in the '16, '17 period, we would expect to see that, but be clear, we are investing in our business. We're a human capital intensive business.","Primarily this year our CapEx is up a little bit more than what it has been by historical trends and that's primarily because we're running out of space and we've done some things to expand our technical capabilities from a physical plant perspective, but you'll continue to see us leverage the SDA as we go forward.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. That was very helpful. I guess the follow-on question is I think last quarter you mentioned that incremental margins could be above 30% in 2016 and 2017 if the investments in the tier solutions paid off. So I am curious if it's outlook is still on track?","Vern Nagel","Well, the answer is we're aggressively each quarter looking to bring every nickel we can of incremental profitability to the bottom line, but we're doing that while appropriately balancing reinvestment back into the business. And so while we're very proud of the incremental margins that we've generated this year, we still expect to not only drive improvement there, but we do expect to invest back into the business.","As we go forward, when we think about future years and the out years as we drive these tiered solutions approach more into Tier 3 into Tier 4, we would expect our variable contribution margins to improve because the overall margins in those tiers our expectation is that they will be higher.","Early indications are suggesting that to be true, but again we're very early in this game.","Ryan Merkel","Fair enough, Vern. Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company.","Jeff Osborne","Great. Good morning and congratulations on the strong results. I was wondering if you could comment on the geographic diversification of revenue and now that the LED technology is becoming more known, are you starting to see the mid American states pick up or are we still heavily centered on the Coast in terms of revenue mix for you folks?","Vern Nagel","That's a great question. Our revenue mix and our growth was reasonably broad based. Some of the geographies where we may have not -- where we were below our average, I don't believe it was a difference between LED and non-LED. It was just that some of these markets from what we can tell were just a little bit slower.","When you think about the two coasts, it's clear that the adoption of LED is moving forward nicely, but we have had great successes in mid America vis-\u00e0-vis LED. If you would have talked to various distributors in those markets, I think that they would tell you that their LED based luminaire business is growing and growing nicely.","So I don't perceive it to be a huge difference. I do think that some of the energy savings codes that some states have promulgated facilitate a more rapid if you will renovation opportunity and typically if folks are looking at alternatives, they're going with LED.","Jeff Osborne","Great. Thanks. And this may be in the 10-Q, but maybe Ricky can elaborate on it. Can you just touch on the $70 million in Canadian revenue for Distech? How much is exposed to the sanctions that you mentioned or that you was a rational for the delayed closing of that?","Ricky Reece","The amount is very de minimis. You will see in the 10-Q that the amount of shipments related to this is less than $300,000. So a very immaterial amount. So it should not have a material impact on the revenue growth going forward.","Jeff Osborne","Great. Appreciate it. Thank you.","Operator","All right. Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vern Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you everyone for your time this morning. We strongly believe we're focusing on the right objectives deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the longer term deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders.","Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today's conference. Your may disconnect at this time."],"642":["Acuity Brands, Inc.

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you and good morning. With me today to discuss our third quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today\u2019s conference call at acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today\u2019s press release, which identify important factors that could cause the actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the third quarter of 2017. Net sales for the third quarter were a record $892 million, an increase of 5% compared with the year ago period. Reported operating profit was $131.5 million compared with $121 million in the year-ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was a $1.90 compared with $1.69 in the year-ago period. There were adjustments in the year ago quarter for certain special items as well as certain add-backs made in both quarters for our results to be comparable between periods as Ricky will explain later in the call. And adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2017 was $148.3 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $146.1 million in the year-ago period, an increase of 2%.","Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.6%, a decrease of 60 basis points compared with a record quarterly margin reported in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a third quarter record of $2.15, up 4% from the year ago period. During the quarter, we purchased approximately 2 million shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $179 per share supporting our bullish view of the long-term prospects for Acuity. We closed the quarter with $190 million of cash on hand leaving us with plenty of financial firepower to execute our growth strategies.","Looking at key highlights for the third quarter. Net sales in the quarter were up 5% over the year-ago period. Overall net sales volume grew approximately 6%. This was offset by approximately 1 point for changes in the price mix of products sold and a modest unfavorable impact for fluctuations in foreign currency. While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in the price and the mix of products sold, we estimate the impact of price mix was primarily due to changes in product price, primarily for more basic lesser featured LED Luminaire sold in certain channels. A few additional points on the makeup of net sales this quarter. Net sales in Mexico and Europe continued to be negatively impacted by political and economic issues in those regions, which collectively reduced our consolidated net sales by almost 1 point this quarter. Overall, the increase in net sales was reasonably broad-based along key product lines and sales channels in the US and Canada.","Additionally, we believe overall market demand remained soft particularly for smaller short cycle projects. To add a bit more color on this, while available market data does not line up perfectly with our quarters, recent information from various organizations including the US Census Bureau and NEMA suggest shipments of lighting fixtures in the United States grew in the low-single digit range for our third quarter, consistent with consensus industry forecast. However, this level of demand was down considerably when compared with the overall market growth rate reported in the year ago period. Please recall demand started to slow in the second half of calendar 2016. Nonetheless we were still able to grow our business in the US and Canada by more than 6% this quarter far outpacing the growth rate of the overall lighting industry, allowing us to continue to gain market share.","I will comment more on our expectations for the balance of 2017 later in the call. Sales of LED products grew robustly this quarter and account for two-thirds of our total net sales, which as you know includes the sale of non-fixture related products and solutions as well. Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative, and holistic lighting and building management solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve solid sales growth this quarter, particularly against the backdrop of a soft market environment. Our profitability measures for the third quarter were solid, but impacted by these tepid market conditions.","Adjusted operating profit for the third quarter was $148.3 million, up $2.2 million compared with the year ago period, while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.6%, down 60 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period. The decline in adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to lower adjusted gross profit margin, partially offset by lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. Gross profit in the third quarter was essentially flat compared with adjusted gross profit reported in the year ago period. Gross profit margin for the third quarter was 42.5% compared with our quarterly record adjusted gross profit margin of 44.5% one year earlier, a decrease of 200 basis points. Gross profit this quarter remained flat compared with the year-ago period and an increase in net sales of almost $40 million.","Gross profit and gross profit margin were negatively impacted by higher than normal supply chain costs, including quality and inbound freight expenses and to a lesser degree the impact of price mix changes. This was partially offset by lower costs for certain components and productivity improvements, primarily from previously announced streamlining actions. We are aggressively addressing these supply chain issues and recently began to adjust our production capacity for certain product families to reflect current market demand. We are also accelerating programs to reduce costs for certain basic, less differentiated product families to maintain our competitiveness and expected profitability. Should market demand strengthen later in the calendar year, we will flex our production capacity to support this expected uptick when it occurs.","Next, adjusted SDA expenses were down $2.1 million compared with the year ago period. Adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales was 25.9% in the third quarter, a decrease of 140 basis points from the year ago period. A slight decrease in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense, partially offset by higher freight and commission cost to support the increase in net sales, greater salary and health care cost due to continued investment in additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solution strategy. Our incentive compensation program is based on period-over-period improvement in our key financial metrics, which are an integral part of our pay for performance culture. Our performance through the first three quarters of this year has resulted in a much lower potential payout than we accrued in the year-ago period.","Our adjusted diluted EPS was $2.15 compared to $2.06 reported in the year-ago period. The increase was primarily due to a 3% increase in pretax income, a lower tax rate in the quarter, and lower average shares outstanding due to the stock purchases this quarter. Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this quarter. On the strategic and technology front, we continue to make great strides setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability over the long term. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry leading portfolio of innovative energy efficient luminaires and lighting controls, as well as our building management capabilities. Many of these solutions are connected to our IoT software platform as innovation continues to be at the forefront of our tiered solution strategy. While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up 35% this quarter and now represent more than 13% of our total sales.","In May, we announced our new Atrius brand, encompassing our portfolio of IoT business solutions and our Atrius software platform, which as you know has been developed over the last few years. This software platform is a robust scalable and secure platform that enables an array of capabilities including indoor positioning, asset tracking, space utilization, spatial analytics, and energy management. The Atrius solution builder provides a comprehensive development environment for customers and partners to build IoT solutions leveraging the Atrius platform. In fact, yesterday we announced the names of some of the industry leading technology and software providers that have adopted the Atrius IoT platform and software solutions that will enhance their ability to deliver unique and valuable capabilities and solutions to their customers. Interests in our Atrius platform is significant and we expect to add additional user partners. Through Atrius, we will continue to provide and expand our comprehensive set of IoT business solutions leveraging intelligent luminaires, lighting and building management controls, software platform services, and development tools.","These solutions deliver connectivity and intelligence to a space via an expansive network of smart LED lighting and controls and a software platform that gathers, unlocks and transforms raw data to enable a broad range of software solutions addressing critical business challenges. Atrius solutions have already been deployed across nearly 60 million square feet of indoor spaces leveraging more than a million sensors. Additionally, the installed base of the Acuity Brands\u2019 network lighting systems encompassing more than a billion square feet and can now be upgraded to a more multi-functional Atrius Sensory Network that can supply IoT data to this robust platform. We launched the Atrius platform at the IoT World Form in London earlier this quarter, creating significant demand from numerous global technology leaders to partner with Acuity to leverage and expand these unique capabilities. From a commercials perspective, we have recently received commitments and orders from both customers accelerating the expansion of their current platforms as well as customers moving beyond pilot programs to implementation. ","Deploying the Atrius IoT platform including our comprehensive lighting and building management solutions that will afford them unique value added capabilities and solutions to enhance their businesses and to potentially allowing us the opportunity to quadruple our installed base of Atrius enabled systems over the next 12 to 18 months. And this does not include the potential growth opportunities from new customers and partners. Again from which there is great interest in deploying our Atrius platform and solutions. ","Lastly, we have added new technologies, capabilities and analytical features to our Atrius solution platform creating a more comprehensive full suite of IoT solutions that are well beyond the proof of concept stage that we believe will continue to contribute to our accelerated growth in our Tier 3 and 4 solutions. We have been able to create these capabilities while providing industry leading results because of the dedication and resolve of our more than 12,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving, supporting the needs of our customers.","I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction markets later in the call. I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2017. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you Vern and good morning everyone. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2017 and 2016 which we find useful to add back for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Primarily due to the impact of the four acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation expense since we used restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to align the interest of key leaders of acquired businesses with those of shareholders, acquisition-related cost, special charges, manufacturing inefficiencies related to the closing of a facility and a gain on the sale of an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you'll find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.","In addition, many of our peer companies especially as we become more of a technology company make these same adjustments, so it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34% compared with 34.3% in the third quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to be approximately 34.5% before any additional discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year. ","At May 31, 2017, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $189.7 million, a decrease of 223.5 million since August 31, 2016. Our operating working capital defined as receivables plus inventories, less payables at May 31, 2017 increased $34.4 million during the nine months of fiscal 2017 to 51 days compared with 41 days in the prior year. This increase was due primarily to increased inventory to support expected higher sales and to improve delivery performance.","In the first nine months of fiscal year 2017, we spent $55.2 million on capital expenditures compared with $61.8 million in the prior year. This decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to reduced spending on facility renovations. We currently expect to spend approximately 2% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017. We have finalized the acquisition accounting for all of our recent acquisitions. As disclosed more fully in our 10-Q filed today with the resulting changes in the valuation of intangible assets, we expect amortization expense to be approximately $28 million annually. ","During the third quarter of fiscal 2017 we completed the repurchase of 2 million shares of the company's outstanding common stock for $357.9 million with an average price paid per share of just under $179. Earlier this week, our Board of Directors authorized an additional 2 million shares for repurchase. This new authorization provides management with the ongoing flexibility to repurchase shares in the future as appropriate.","We believe that repurchasing our shares represent a wise use of our cash flow especially during periods of high stock price volatility and allows us to offset dilution resulting from our stock based compensation and benefit programs. Additionally, we believe that repurchases of the company's stock supports Acuity Brands objective to maximize long-term shareholder, while continuing to fund investments to better serve our customers, grow our business, and improve our operating and financial performance. ","Our total debt outstanding was $356.7 million at May 31, 2017. We had additional borrowing capacity of 244.7 million at May 31, 2017 under our credit facility which does not expire until August 2019. Our net debt to total capitalization at May 31, 2017 was a mere 9.8%. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility and will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash flow generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you and I\u2019ll now turn it back over to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. At Acuity, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever changing and evolving in a positive direction for our company. Recent economic and industry data shows the end markets we serve in North America and certain markets in Europe through the first three quarters of our year moved along at a much slower and more inconsistent pace than was originally anticipated by various forecasting organizations. ","In fact it now appears from various data sources we collect that total growth for the lighting fixture market will be up in the low-single digit range for the balance of calendar 2017, primarily driven by softness in end user demand, particularly for certain smaller projects that have short lead times. Additionally, we continue to hear from customers that labor shortages in certain markets continue to cause delays in larger projects.","Current forecasts are calling for a rebound in luminaire sales for 2018 supported by growth in the overall economy as well as a more consistent growth rate for non-residential and residential contract awards. Therefore we remain bullish regarding the company's long-term prospects for continued profitable growth, particularly as we bring more value added solutions to the market for both new construction and the conversion of the installed base. ","We continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve. Leading indicators for the North American market such as architectural billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability, and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces. So the following are a few of our key assumptions as we focus on the second half of the calendar year 2017. Given the information just noted, we expect the lighting market in North America, our largest market to grow modestly in the second half of calendar 2017.","Additionally, we expect to continue to outperform the overall growth rate of the market we serve. Next, we expect the price of certain LED components to continue to decline though at a decelerating pace, while certain other costs including certain components and commodity costs as well as certain employee-related costs primarily due to further investments in associate headcount, wage inflation, and healthcare costs will increase somewhat. We expect to mitigate some of the impact of these rising costs through certain pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and product cost reductions, while the timing of these initiatives might lack the timing of these increased costs. ","Next, we continue to be leery of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are unpredictable. Next, while our gross profit margin is influenced by several factors, including sales volume, innovation, components and commodity cost, market level pricing, and changes in the mix of products and sales channels, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grows and as we realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","We continue to target a current variable contribution margin on an incremental sales dollars in the mid to upper 20% range over a full-year period knowing that is not possible to predict with precision what the rate will be by quarter. Our current supply chain issues as well as competitive pressures for certain products sold in certain channels has influenced our profit and margin dynamics somewhat this year. Nonetheless we believe the actions we have put in place to reduce costs and enhance the value of our solutions as well as overall market growth will allow us to expand our margins over the long term. I would point out that our variable contribution margin this quarter was 28% on a sequential basis over the second quarter. Next, our adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of sales was approximately 26% year-to-date. This is below our recent trend primarily due to much lower incentive compensation expense.","Trust me, we are motivated to drive strong period-over-period growth, which is at the core of our pay for performance culture, which would result in a much higher incentive compensation expense. This means we would expect our adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales to closer to our historical trend, assuming market rebound somewhat as we noted earlier and we continue to meaningfully outpace the growth rates of the markets we serve. This further assumes we execute as we have in the past regarding our supply chain performance and can move gross margins towards our historical trend. So to be very clear, our focus is to garner additional topline growth, driven primarily by our ability to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve and to leverage our infrastructure achieving targeted incremental margins to improve our overall profitability.","Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited and focused on the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting, building management, and Atrius IoT platform and software solutions. As I noted earlier, we are now converting certain customers to implementation from pilot programs and we continue to expand the number of pilot programs of customers for these smart platforms and continue to experience strong interest in many other key customers and potential partners in multiple verticals to deploy our holistic solutions with these unique capabilities and more. ","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy and opportunities to meaningfully participate in interconnect of world is an integral part of our overall growth strategy to meaningfully expand our addressable market by adding significantly greater broad based holistic solutions that will allow our customers to optimize the performance of their facilities. As we noted earlier, while we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for our tier 3 and 4 categories as well as the acceptance of our IoT enabled smart platform solutions, particularly with the launch of our new Atrius platform.","Our company wide strategy is straightforward, expand and leverage our industry leading product and solutions portfolio coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources, we are investing today to enhance and expand our core competencies, affording us the opportunity to excel in our fast changing industry because we see great future opportunity. ","Through these investments we are significantly expanding our addressable market. Our strong growth record supports this view. As I said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and more importantly the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size to more efficient and effective solutions. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation along with our Atrius platform, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you and with that we will entertain your questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Vishal Shah of Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.","Vishal Shah","Congratulations on strong execution, I was just wondering if you can maybe talk a little bit about your contribution margins during the quarter and also what you\u2019re seeing in stock and flow business, it looks like the business is still soft. What percentage of your product business today is stock and flow and how do you think that's going to trend over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Now with regard to our contribution margin, quite frankly we had nice growth relative to market conditions. We grew in our US and Canadian business more than 6%, so against the backdrop of a marketplace that we believe was up 2, that\u2019s a meaningful outperformance. We would have expected contribution at the gross profit level much greater than what we had. So let me just do some math for everyone. If you imagine that we target our variable contribution margin to sort of be in the mid to upper 20s, when you take away freight and commission expense, the rest of it would be in gross profit. ","So, clearly there was a shortfall. As we look at what's happening in our business, we continue to have challenges within our supply chain and we call it supply chain, but it's really more connected than that. Some of the issues as we continue to accelerate the introduction of new products and new solutions that the connectivity between engineering and manufacturing and then further our component supply base continues to be a challenge for us. ","We pride ourselves on being very, very good at this, but we have seen issues that have given rise to some quality issues that we have to address as well as the fact that we're incurring greater inbound freight as we try to better align our supply base. Let me give you one example around this. We have a key supplier that has supplied us with some products for quite a long time for a small subset of what we do, but an important subset of what we do. This particular supplier has moved their manufacturing operations to a more low cost environment and in that process they have struggled. ","They struggled to keep up with the demand that we have. So it's impacted somewhat our topline, but it's very much impacted our gross profit line because we've had to incur additional cost to help facilitate that. I am very confident that in time we will solve those issues and you will see from a cost perspective improvements that would be more consistent with what we've historically operated at.","So when I look at this quarter and I see that loss of variable contribution margins, it has more to do with self-inflicted wounds than it does in our view with the overall market dynamics. Again as I said in the call, we are addressing that. To the second question with regard to the stock and flow, the stock and flow business is really supporting these smaller short cycle type projects. We continue just to see overall softness. We have different pieces of data that are confirming this level of softness. ","Larger projects continue to move along nicely. Orders and quotations that we see continue to be very positive for those medium to larger projects. On the stock and flow side, I don't have good data or information to say exactly why it is happening, but I do believe that people are taking a bit of a wait and see approach. I can use Acuity as an example. We're looking to add some additional paint capacity. The question is, where do we put that capacity. As we wrestle with some of the thoughts that are coming out of Washington about taxing policies, that will influence our decision.","So here is a company like Acuity that's delaying certain investments as a wait and see. My guess is that that flows through to the marketplace as well. But our stock and flow business, an important piece of our business and we supported and served it well. So as that market rebounds we would expect to continue to outperform in that space as well.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Tim Wojs of Baird. Your line is now open.","Josh Chan","Hi good morning, this is our Josh Chan on for Tim. Thanks for taking our questions. Yes, my first question is following up on some of the gross margin discussion. Vern, you mentioned that the supply chain issues and then you also mentioned rising costs in other areas as well. So just wondering as we look forward, do these issues - how long do these issues persist and how should we think about gross margin trajectory next quarter and then obviously into the next year? ","Vern Nagel","So again it's an interesting dynamic. When I look at our labor cost within our supply chain as a percentage of sales, we continue to drive productivity, we continue to see improvements in that area. So if some of these exogenous areas that have more to do with, if you will business processes and then those folks that help supply us. Again, if our supply chain and I don't necessarily mean our internal capacity to assemble or to paint or to do some of the things that we have great core competencies around, it's how material is moving from suppliers into our system. If those are not precisely connected or those folks are having issues, they're going to impact us. We have with this one particular example I gave you, we've seen that now for, what probably three quarters in a row Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Yes.","Vern Nagel","And we're seeing improvement, but it's slow and this is an important supplier. We're taking actions to help mitigate to help support to do some of these things. I expect that we will continue to see progress. As I mentioned to you earlier, when we look at our variable contribution margin, third quarter compared to the second quarter. So sequentially we were up 28% which is reflective of the improvements that we're making. I would expect those to continue as we wrestle through some of these issues. ","A number of the quality issues that we're experiencing really are from solutions and business processes that were a year ago and we're now experiencing some of these. We believe that we have addressed a number of the business processes. What we mean by that is you know the handoff from engineering and product development to manufacturing and then to supply base, we think we have addressed many of those issues, but we're dealing with the lingering effects of that.","So my expectation is that we'll still see some headwinds if you will as we fix those things, but again I'm robust and positive that this is in our wheelhouse, we're good at this stuff, it's just that we're experiencing - have been experiencing some issues here within the supply chain. If we had performed and I'm not suggesting we didn't, but if we did what we normally do, I think that the variable contribution margin that had been more in that mid to upper 20s, the growth and performance would have been more in line with the kinds of expectations and performance that we're capable of delivering. So I'm optimistic about the actions that we're taking. I like how we're driving productivity, I like our focus around these things. But my guess is we'll still be dealing with some of the lingering, the lag effect of fixing some of those items over the next quarter or so.","Josh Chan","And if I can switch gears to the tier 3 and 4 solutions that you talked about, obviously, there's been a lot of headlines on retail recently. So wondering what your thoughts are on whether the online effect is impacting your opportunity set there and also do you have targets for other verticals and are you making headway in those other verticals as well. Thanks.","Vern Nagel","Yes. So we believe that as the folks in retail who have a massive installed base look to adjust, enhance their business models on how they serve customers and take advantage of their proximity and location, we think it provides a unique opportunity for the Atrius solution set to drive real value to enhance those capabilities. I didn't mention those, but we are very excited about taking Atrius, not only from indoor, but to the outdoor opportunity, so we create an entire campus capability if you will to provide the types of analytics and asset tracking and other things that we're able to provide that are really value add to these types of, whether it's retailers or public spaces or healthcare and educational campuses, we see it as a unique opportunity to add value. ","When we think about the base, these things take longer than most people anticipate because folks are testing these solution sets and they're looking at do others to provide capabilities and why is this capability so robust. This quarter I believe was a bit of a watershed quarter because we now have customers that are moving from implementation to an accelerated implementation. We have a number of customers who are now moving from pilot programs to implementation. So as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, just the base that we have today and with orders and commitments that we have in hand, we would expect to quadruple the amount of space that is covered under the Atrius solution platform over the next 12 to 18 months. ","And as you all probably saw here just recently, we announced partners that are now engaged in utilizing the Atrius IoT platform as embedded into their capabilities. This is a hugely exciting opportunity for us to really drive growth and there will be more announcements around these types of folks, because we have a robust platform. When I think about the number of square footage and the customers that we're dealing with in multiple verticals and how these things are moving along, we still have competitors that are trying to figure out how to do it in one space. ","So when you think about one space versus the thousands that we're now and it's a huge difference, so very excited about what that opportunity is and it will continue because it's a long spec cycle to roll out, but the momentum is building and we're excited about that. That's why when we point out what we -- our growth in our tier 3 area was in the kind of the mid-30s, 35% growth and now represents 13% of our business for these types of solution set. So very exciting for us and we think that this is additive to our overall growth beyond just what market and some of our ability to gain shares in our local market.","Operator","Our next question is from Brian Lee of Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Lee","I guess, first off, Vern with the new data that you're looking at suggesting a low single digit growth for the industry moving through the rest of calendar \u201917, does that change your thoughts around the growth recovery. I think in the past, you had talked about sort of exiting this year and early 2018. So I would be curious if one, the timing of your view on growth recovery for the industry is changing and then two, historically, you guys have kind of grown at close to 2x over industry growth rate. Is that still the ratio you're sort of targeting? I know you haven't quantified it more recently, but just wondering if anything has changed there.","Vern Nagel","Sure. So let me answer the second question first. The last couple of quarters, we've seen the marketplace slowdown relative to the year ago quarter whatever that was and kind of be in this more low single digit range and yet, our growth this quarter, when I look at US, Canada, which is -- I put Europe which is a small piece of our business and Mexico aside which have some political issues going on, our growth was, we believe, 3x the market. So pretty robust. What we target is just to meaningfully outperform. ","I think that Acuity, over the last, go back three or four years, has meaningfully outperformed the growth rate of the overall market. And so our expectation is that we will continue to do that. And we'll do that in an aggressive way. We think that providing our Atrius platform and our tier 3 and tier 4 solution set that really bring along the quality of our lighting and building management products is an opportunity just to facilitate an even greater growth rate than the overall market growth rate. Our competitors don't have this capability. ","When we think about the growth rate of the markets, coming into 2017, all of the market forecasters on a consensus basis were projecting more growth and I think that that enthusiasm was built off of just generally improving economic activities, employment so on and so forth. This bifurcation in what, larger projects versus smaller projects, there's lots of speculation as to what's causing that. I do think that folks are taking a bit more of a wait and see approach. So, is that causing a delay in the overall market growth? Could be. ","I don't know precisely why, but I know it's happening. 2018, our view is that and we're looking at the same data that all of you look at, whether it's Dodd's, Global Insights', different economic forecasts from different organizations, I think people are expecting that there will be sort of a clearing of the air around some of these clouds, whether it's tax policy or some of the other things that are overhanging people, political views around what's going to happen with NAFTA, so on and so forth. ","I think as these things kind of move away, move off the table, I think that there's a lot of underlying pent-up demand for a lot of these things, the value propositions for renovation and retrofit are really strong and I think that as we continue to bring even more value in terms of the Atrius platform, I think that we're going to see an acceleration of our growth, but I also believe that the underlying market growth rate will continue to improve.","Brian Lee","Just second question, I'll pass it on, is, I know you guys don't necessarily think about the business in these terms, but you do break it out. So we tend to look at it this way from the software community. The LED segment growth, it's nothing to see that in the mid teens here, but it has degraded faster than I think a lot of people would have expected here and you're now kind of back in line with what the growth rate is for peers after a long time of outgrowing peers. Any specific drivers you can point to there, is this just the new normal after a period of outsized growth in that particular technology segment or when you mention reacceleration in the business, would that be a particular area where we might see those growth rates start to take back up, especially with Atrius embedded in those numbers. Thank you.","Vern Nagel","I believe that our LED growth rate is exceeding the market growth rate. Ricky, when we look at some of the data that we have around sales relative to others, it's positive for that. So I don't know that I completely agree with the statement of the premise that we're now at peer levels. [indiscernible] is important. A lot of folks have come out as you and asked this question, but I'll look to address it a bit. What's happening in the pricing in the market and certain things, our overall price mix and we believe was mostly price as quarter of as a point, right, but we don't participate in every aspect of the market. ","So where there is, if you will, aggressive price pressures where people are talking about that folks do certain channel checks, Acuity doesn't always participate in that. So when we look at our growth rates and look at what's happening in our luminaires. We participate and always have in a bid market and so pricing is always competitive and what happens in one geography may not be happening in another for a certain set of product, so on and so forth. But when I look at our overall luminaire business and it depends on what type of product set it is, I mean, we are robustly now in full penetration. ","When I look at down lighting and things of that nature, Ricky, I mean, it's a high number. And so you're continuing to add value in different ways to bring solutions to the market that are not just based on competitive price pressures. Again, we have said that we expect component costs to continue to decline, though we believe at somewhat of a decelerating rate and some of that goes back into the marketplace. So overall, I believe that our growth in LED will continue to outpace the market, will continue to be favorable. ","And I -- and unit volume for many of these products and again as component prices come down, we'll have to -- we'll offset some of the top line effects, if you will. How much of that is impacting the market, I still believe that when we look at our overall business, stock inflow is not an unimportant part of our business at all, but it's probably in that 20% range. I don't know precisely what the number is, it may be slightly less than that, Ricky, when we look at the -- against the total backdrop, including total sales, building management and other sorts of things. ","So again, while it's an important piece of our business, price mix for us was about a point and we believe that point was primarily in the luminaire side, which I think is very different than others who may be participating in other type of products that basic less featured end that we are. We participate in certain skews and it's an important part of our business and that's why we're aggressively looking at our cost structures to be more competitive and maintain the profit dynamics that we have. But again, when we looked at our results for the quarter, our gross profit impact was primarily due to some of these supply chain issues, not related to the price mix side of it. ","Ricky, do you have any additional comments?","Ricky Reece","The only other thing I'd mention is, on the LED, as Vern said, we participate in much of that broad market, but there are segments like the lamps, the LED tubes, some of those areas which are experiencing nice growth and in some areas as they're replacing incandescent and so forth, but are seeing huge price declines and challenges and all there. So as you look at our results and compare it to some of our peers recognize that that's a part of the LED market that we have strategically chosen not to participate in.","Operator","Our next question is from Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Christopher Glynn","Interesting headline on the Atrius Partners. I'm wondering if you could speak to how substantive that partner engagement is versus sure will be interested in lighting and what the real buy-in on the notion of luminaire as a truly core edge device is.","Vern Nagel","Yeah. So the Atrius platform is a broad based platform. It's collecting -- it has the ability to collect data from multiple sensor sources, not just lighting. We see lighting and our partners in this regard see lighting as a very dense ubiquitous capability to create a robust sensory network that can tie into many other types of sensory networks. So there goes HVAC, think of other building things, literally any sensor that you can imagine. The Atrius platform has the again robust ability to collect that information and then in a very, very user friendly way, provide that data so that people with their own SDKs can create apps or analytics and the solution set and how they can do that through Atrius is really simple and really efficient and it's a point of significant differentiation. ","So what these partners see is the ability to say, oh instead of using a very less efficient data collection sensor, battery enabled beacon some type, I'm just using that as an example, we could collect that data. But because we have this again very robust sensory network from lighting, it's a great source for many of their solution sets, so the data is now being made available to them. Our team has done an extraordinary job of really creating sort of the API that is robust and secure and scalable and the SDK kits are really very, very efficient. So Chris, these partners see this as an enabling capability that makes them very, very efficient in how they then get the data to then use it in the apps where they're bringing differentiated value. ","So we're very excited about this. As you know, the investment that we've made over the years to create the Atrius platform, whether it's acquisitions of Geometri, eldoLED, DGLogik, many of these kinds of things and then the -- our only investment of our software engineer and our various engineering teams, again you know we have now hundreds of people that are focused on this. So the coming out party, under the Atrius platform, various pieces and parts have been in the market today now will flow in. It's no longer proof of concept. We are engaging people to have this become, if you will, the standard within their system to be able to collect data and then they do their thing, their value add in terms of what they're providing to that end customer. ","So we're very excited about this. There's very significant demand and we're aggressively putting resources behind this to market these programs and solutions to these folks. I would just say to the -- to all of the listeners here, you know, in the last quarter, if I think about how we have net added folks in our salaried workforce, probably 90% of them are focused on this type of solution set that is really part of the broader Atrius IoT platform and solution set, the big deal.","Christopher Glynn","And if I can ask you to, I mean speculatively, you mentioned the quadrupling of the installed base. A couple of questions, is that off and running on more backend loaded as momentum follows a normal build pattern and is the quadruple kind of a snapshot, what you see now versus you know maybe that is dynamic you know metric as momentum builds and we get updates the next few quarters?","Vern Nagel","Yeah. I think it will be important, because this is all new and developing, it's spotty, right? It's not like you can say, okay, here is the overall market, it grows at this rate and then you can gauge what we're doing. We're developing if you will a solution set into a marketplace that has been rudimentary. So people are testing it, people are working with it, they're experimenting with it. Those that were the early adopters are now moving more and more to a more rapid implementation, because they now are using it to do things that create real value to them and they're driving that. Folks that were in pilot programs are now moving from pilot to implementation, so it will go through its normal rollout. ","We just want folks to understand that the significant difference that Acuity has relative to what competitors, you might view as competitors, traditional people saying, I can do that too, just ask them, what's their installation set look like? And now you have a real sense of just how far we are in this opportunity compared to our competitors. So I think it's going to be a -- it will be a little bit lumpy as we roll out that like I said, I think over the next 12 to 18 months, off the base that we have, this is what we're expecting based on the commitments and orders that they have. ","We just know that this is a snapshot today and our teams are aggressively marketing to partners, to other lighting companies, to other vertical sets. Again as we think about who are we targeting, retailer is a great example. Public spaces are a great example and then you think of campuses, whether it's university campus, research campuses, healthcare campuses, those are the verticals where it's really low hanging fruit and opportunistic. And then when you get into our traditional business, we're bringing unique solution sets into the commercial office building, into warehouses. ","We're expanding Atrius and having discussions with people who are focused on that industrial warehouse manufacturing space because of the unique capabilities of this Atrius IoT platform to collect data from any source and then provided that data into a very, very effective SDK process where people can write apps against it, just to facilitate meaningfully their ability to provide data and analytics back.","Operator","Our next question is from John Walsh of Vertical Research. Your line is now open.","John Walsh","I guess a lot of ground covered, but you know two kind of quick ones. One as we think about the investments you're making in software and engineers over the next couple of years and what you've already been doing, are we at the point where we're starting to plateau or are there still kind of significant step ups that have to happen from the run rate we're at currently.","Vern Nagel","So the way we try to address that question is really to [Technical Difficulty]. I would say that we still need to [Technical Difficulty] marketing sides of things, really working with customers to make sure that their solution set is being supported the way they want, so that it comes off without a hitch. So we need some more capability there. Those folks will be both engineers as well as other skill sets, but I don't consider that to be a huge number. I think the bulk of the investment that was necessary to get Atrius to where it is today, meaning a very viable platform that can be used in the market and a number of applications, it's pretty robust. ","And so I think that the variable contribution margin number that we target, mid to upper-20s is still good for a while, because we will be adding capability, but as you all know and I've said this before and Ricky and Dan have said this before, our expectation is that, there's a crossover point, we begin to really leverages this. I think we're some quarters away from that, but we're getting closer every day.","Ricky Reece","The excitement I would add to that is while the investment is there and will continue to have some add, we're now starting to see the return off of these several years of investments. Early on, we had to build the platform, we had to build out the API, [indiscernible] and all before you really started seeing meaningful revenue. Now with the momentum that we're seeing, we're now starting to see the return come in, both on the sales of the infrastructure, but also on the recurring revenues as well that is enjoyable to see that we're now getting a return on these years of investment.","Vern Nagel","And Ricky, I think you would also agree that the opportunity to add solution sets to basic lesser featured products allows them to have more value than just trying to compete on a very defeatured really low value add product, just because something's low value or it doesn't have a lot of features doesn't mean it doesn't reside in the space. That real estate in that ceiling is valuable. I think that Atrius gives us the opportunity to make those basic products more valuable, more differentiated and more competitive against folks who are simply trying to say, oh, I have a low price. So we're excited about what this opportunity means for our tier 1 and our tier 2 solution sets and tier 3 that that go through more traditional channels. This is a value add opportunity that will help us further differentiate. In every situation? No. But in many situations, yes and that's a margin enhancement opportunity on what we'll call basic defeatured type luminaires.","John Walsh","And then I guess just a follow-up to that, as we think about future proofing and turning clients on potentially at a later date for services, how is the system set up so that somebody might not be ready to go to a full blown solution today, but they want to have that capability down the road. Is that embedded in kind of some of the less smart luminaires today and then obviously LED, once it goes into the ceiling, you're talking about potentially 15 year plus life, how do you kind of future proof and I'm assuming it's mostly software updates, but maybe kind of talk a little bit about that.","Vern Nagel","So our nLight system is a very robust capability that has been out for a while. We estimate -- it's an estimate. We estimate that there is probably 1 billion square feet of space that is nLight enabled that really now has the opportunity in a very simple way to enjoy the benefits of the Atrius IoT platform. So we have customers that have this capability in place. It's also through our nLight eclipse system, which was created in conjunction with Distech, which is a fantastic acquisition, great team to create these capabilities. So we have an installed base. ","They have the ability through their nLight capability to upgrade or to take advantage of our Atrius IoT platform. And as we talk to customers today, it's at the forefront of our discussion to say, hey, look, you're converting to LED, you should hear the energy savings that you have that you should future proof this, so that it can be Atrius IoT enabled, because one day, if you're not ready today, you can use this capability to do many, many things and we believe that's a very robust opportunity, because as you imagine, some of these other partners who are using the Atrius platform and the SDK capability to create apps that are targeted towards things, this is really our model. ","We want other people who are accretive, all get up, writing apps that help the end customer enhance the value of their space, indoor and outdoor, enhance the productivity, enhance the use, but it's all, if you will, paid for through the notion of energy savings, energy efficient lighting in their space.","Operator","Our next question is from Cindy Motz of Williams Capital Group.","Cindy Motz","Congrats on the buyback and the overall growth and just even reining in some of the incentive compensation. That was great. But I just had a question on Atrius, just following up. In general, you had a nice ramp. Looks like sales are growing at 35% versus like 25% like you said I guess a quarter ago. That should mean good things for gross margins as well, right, because it's recurring revenues, more like software margins. So could we, I mean, if you get the supply chain issues in order and you also have the bump, let's say, from increased margins from Atrius, I would think that your margins as you said should go up, but I mean could we see some of that next quarter, I'm just curious obviously going forward and then I had a question just on revenues. But if you want to answer that one first.","Vern Nagel","Cindy, first of all, reining in incentive comp is not our objective here, because we are --","Cindy Motz","No. I saw the comp decline now, I saw that percentage come down, so. So we're doing what you said you're going to do? ","Vern Nagel","Yeah. It means that we're not having the kind of period over period improvement that we are after too. Anyway, let me answer or attempt to answer some of the questions around the margin of Atrius. First of all, our tier 3 solution set, recall that it is a broad based solution set, where we're tying together luminaires and building management capability, in your conference room, in your floor, tied your whole building. Those solution sets can be enabled to do different types of things within Atrius. Asset tracking and geospatial activity or analytics, so on and so forth. ","So tier 3, that billing and square foot of base that we believe is in place, most of those folks put that in place primarily because they were targeting energy savings. It's just that our solution set through nLight offers them the opportunity to now upgrade that, if you will, to an Atrius solution. So as Atrius itself begins to spice the stew and the mix within that tier 3 and as it allows us to then generate recurring revenues to support on a subscription basis, the Atrius platform, when you look at those two together, that's where you in time will see the margin lift as the mix moves, as those businesses grow. ","Our core business -- our core lighting business has tremendous potential and opportunity for continued growth and we do well there from a margin perspective. So as one is growing at a nice exceeding market rate, the other one is accelerating as more adoption occurs, yes, our expectation is that in a normal operating environment, their margins would continue to improve. Unfortunately, right now, you have sort of two things working, right. We're trying to bring clarity around what's happening operationally within our business. ","So we've got some things to continue to address and fix, but then what's happening on those incremental margins, I'm still very comfortable and I think Ricky is as well that targeting incremental margins over the next quarters, handful less, one whatever will probably be in that mid to upper 20 kind of variable contribution margins. Then accelerating as our investment in our core, we now really start to leverage that. You're not having to add more, if you will, engineers to create, you're adding more people to help support, but at a much lower rate, getting much more leverage that makes sense.","Cindy Motz","And just on revenues. So we're still, I mean, the next quarter, this quarter that we're in and your last quarter fiscally, we usually see the seasonal bump. So I would expect that we would still see that that seasonal bump and the only other question I had was I saw in the Q, you said that you were going to adapt ASU 2014, Ricky, September 1. So going forward, should we expect to see anything like from -- because I know that size, cash receipts revenues more from the project thing. So just on revenues. Thanks.","Ricky Reece","Okay. On the seasonality of the revenues, you're correct that historically our fourth quarter, fourth fiscal quarter is our seasonal high. Our third and fourth combined usually are 52%, 53% of the total revenues for the year and there's nothing that would suggest we wouldn't see that same level of seasonality this year. A lot of it is school season driven, weather driven, those types of things. As far as the accounting, I assume you're talking about the revenue recognition standard. That for us, we won't have to adopt until the first quarter of our fiscal '19. So it will be September of '18 that we adopt it. ","We're very much in the throes of looking at contracts and preparing for that. You saw enhanced disclosures in the 10-Q regarding the preparedness that we are going through to adopt that. It will have an impact on us, particularly on the tier 4 recurring revenue, subscription type revenue and you're right, that will result in a more deferred accounting for that that will not necessarily match the cash flow. So we will have upfront cash hopefully that we collect that may get deferred. ","Warranties is another area that we will be impacted as we'll have to likely separate that out as a separate revenue component and defer the portion of the revenue that's related to the warranty side. So it will have an impact, I don't know that it will be nearly as material as some other industries, but it will have an impact. But we are fortunate with our fiscal year end that while most people have to adopt a January 1st of '18, we have all the way until August. So we've got a little bit more time before we'll have to adopt that standard.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vern Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you everyone for your time this morning. As you can tell, we strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will, over the longer term, continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders.

After today's presentation there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections you may disconnect at this time.","Now I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you and good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2016 fourth quarter and full-year results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at www.acuitybrands.com. I would like to remind everyone that during this call we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Vern.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions.","First let me say we are very pleased with our performance in 2016. We achieved record results for virtually all financial metrics including net sales, operating profit, diluted earnings per share and cash flow generation. For the full year in the fourth quarter net sales grew approximately 22%, while sales volume excluding acquisitions was more than double the estimated mid-single-digit growth rates of the key markets we serve. In fact this was the 14th quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a remarkable achievement that few companies can claim.","We believe these results are yet again strong evidence of strategies to deliver superior returns to shareholders, provide customers with differentiated value-added solutions, and diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding allowing us to extend our leadership position. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative energy-efficient lighting and building management solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and companywide productivity.","We achieved record profitability for the quarter and full-year even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth, as well as opportunity for significant future growth potential including the expansion of our digital lighting and building management solutions portfolio which affords us a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet of Things.","I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more details later in the call but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights, first for the quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were a quarterly record of $926 million, an increase of 22% compared with a year ago period. Our net sales could have been even higher as I will explain later in the call.","Reported operating profit was $135.1 million compared with $111.8 million in the year ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $1.89 quarterly record compared with the $1.37 in the year ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items which Ricky will explain later in the call.","Also our reported financial results included certain items among others such as share based compensation expense, costs associated with acquisitions and certain purchase accounting adjustments including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangible's. Because many shareholders and analyst asked specific questions regarding these items in order to make our results comparable between periods, we will continue to add back these items to our reported results to provide greater transparency and comparability.","And adding back these items one can see adjusted operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 was a quarterly record of the $156.5 million compared with adjusted operating profit of $123.6 million year ago period, an increase of 27%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 16.9%, an increase of 60 basis points. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.21 up 27% from the year ago period again strong quarterly results.","For the full year net sales at Acuity were a record $3.3 billion of 22% from 2015. Reported operating profit was $475 million in 2016 compared to $376 million in the year ago period while diluted earnings per share was $6.63 up 30% for the year ago period.","Adjusted operating profit was $555 million in 2016 up 32% from the year ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was a record 16.9% up 130 basis points compared with the prior-year. Adjusted diluted EPS was a record $7.84 up almost 35% from 2015.","In addition, we generated a record $346 million in net cash provided by operating activities this year up 20% from last year. We closed the year with $413 million of cash on hand even after investing $623 million for acquisitions, as well as $84 million in capital expenditures this year leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies.","Lastly, I\u2019m pleased to report that we once again earned much more than our cost of capital. Our adjusted cash flow return on investment for 2016 was 34%, tying our all-time high even after the significant investments made this year.","We believe this level of return is far in excess of others in the electrical industry. For those who follow EVA we generated over $150 million of positive EVA an astounding achievement.","To put our performance and perspective, I like to remind folks of two points. First the nonresidential construction market and important market for us is still down about 15% on an inflation adjusted basis from its peak in 2008 and yet our net sales were up 65% since then.","Second we sold virtually no LED-based fixtures in 2008 and today these solutions make up almost two-thirds of our net sales. We have invested significantly to make Acuity the leader in digital lighting while at the same time delivering superior financial performance for our shareholders.","While our record results for the quarter and the full year were significant improvements over the year ago period, it could have been even better. We would like to provide you with more color on our results for the quarter in the year. Net sales and profitability for the fourth quarter were all-time quarterly records. However as I said, our results could have been even greater and here's why.","During the quarter we made the decision to accelerate certain actions to streamline our supply chain, enhance our customer service and drive productivity. These actions included among others the closure of a manufacturing location, and the transfer of certain production to alternate locations in order to free up additional capacity for future growth, and to better leverage our overall supply chain.","These actions overlapped with the ramping up of a new production facility and the addition of a new paint line. The combination of these actions created labor shortages in certain locations which negatively impacted production and shipments which resulted in cancelled orders, as well as added costs.","We estimate these short-term labor issues resulted in cancelled orders and lost contribution and more than $25 million of net sales and caused us to incur additional overtime and other costs in excess of $2 million in the quarter. We're not going to attempt to quantify the impact of these labor shortages had on our fourth quarter results beyond what I noted just now.","Please note the actions implemented this quarter will provide significant benefits to our business as we go forward. While the impact of these labor issues is mostly behind us, we may experience some modest carryover effect into our first quarter which we do not expect to have material impact on our results.","Looking more closely at the fourth quarter, net sales grew 22% compared with the year ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew an impressive 13%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points while changes in price mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately two points and one point respectively.","While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on like kind LED luminaires between periods reflecting the decline in certain component cost and to a lesser degree changes in the mix of products sold.","The increase in net sales was broad based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for almost two-thirds of our total net sales, as you know includes the sale of non-fixture related products and solutions as well.","Lastly we believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments. Our profitability measures for the fourth quarter were outstanding even while absorbing the impact of the supply chain and streamlining actions I noted earlier and the continued investments in areas of growth such as our unified lighting and building management platform and our IoT capabilities.","Our adjusted fourth quarter operating profit was $156.5 million, the most in our history and adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 16.9% and just shy of our quarterly record of 17.2% but up 60 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period.","Further our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was 43.5% up 120 basis points compared with the year ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout most of the supply chain and lower input cost partially offset by the addition of Juno which in its recent past has had lower gross profit margin than Acuity, as well as a short-term impact of the supply chain and streamlining actions taken during the quarter.","Next, total selling distribution and administrative expenses excluding the adjustments noted earlier for each quarter were up $48.1 million or 24%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 26.6% in the current quarter, an increase of 60 basis points from the year ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the addition of acquisitions and higher compensation cost. The increase in compensation cost was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy.","This next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our fourth quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin excluding the impact of acquisitions. On a comparable basis our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 26% well within our current target of mid to upper 20s. All-in-all, we had another great quarter.","The story was much same for the full year's record sales results - full year record results in 2016. Net sales grew 22% this year. Excluding acquisitions our net sales grew over 13%, while sales volume grew over 15% more than two times the estimated growth rate of our addressable market. Adjusted gross profit margin was a record 43.7% up 140 basis points compared with the prior year's gross profit margin.","Adjusted operating profit margin of 16.9% improved 130 basis points over 2015. Our adjusted variable contribution margin for the full year excluding acquisitions was almost 30% even while we invested aggressively in areas which represent exciting growth opportunities. Again, we had another great year.","On the strategic front 2016 we continue to make great strides setting a stage for what we believe will be a strong growth and profitability in 2017 and beyond. Internally we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions, as well as our building management platform.","With the addition of Juno, we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from more than three times as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our digital lighting solutions portfolio including controls that also support building management and IoT applications.","Innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy, winning accolades from customers and numerous industry awards this year for introducing solutions never seen before. In fact Forbes Magazine recently recognized Acuity Brands in its top 100 most innovative companies list. No other lighting company or building management company made this exclusive list. This is a remarkable achievement for our extraordinary associates. And remember this is from a company with long time industry leading brands one of which is been in existence for almost 120 years.","Additionally we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated tiered solutions strategy which consists of four tier levels. As we noted before, the purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customer solutions that best meet their needs whether it be a single device which we categorize as Tier 1 or a complete holistic integrated lighting and building management solution which we refer to as Tier 3 for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between.","We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri, DGLogik and Juno 2016 had meaningfully enhanced our industry leading capabilities and solutions portfolio.","While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up almost 40% this year over 2015, and now represent more than 10% of our total sales. Furthermore our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things affording Acuity additional recurring revenue streams which we identify as Tier 4 solutions.","To fully execute our holistic tiered solution strategy, we have continued to hone our organizational structure to be more customer centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers creating the best solutions for our customers applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year including our recent acquisitions, as well as increased salary headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy.","In fact our salaried headcount is up over 30% from one year earlier and includes acquisitions. Few other companies if any have been able to make this kind of investment while delivering upper quartile financial performance like Acuity. Additionally now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they best can control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment while realizing additional benefits including energy and maintenance savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things.","Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application and with the additions of Distech, Juno, DGLogik and Geometri, we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.","At Acuity we're not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. As I noted last quarter, we had converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers including global leading retailers and certain other customers to smart lighting solutions. As part of their smart lighting solution platform, we had more than 200,000 maintenance free Beacon enabled lighting fixtures that are performing superbly collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with the superior lighting and energy performance, as well as useful actionable information.","Importantly, we are on a path to almost quadruple this installed base by the end of calendar 2016. We believe this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. Integration of Distech which operates in its historical markets as more of a standalone company continues to move along very well. We expect the combination of Distech and Acuity with our broad industry leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovated control technologies in integrated digital solutions to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy by offering holistic unified solutions that deliver true end to end optimization of all aspects of the building.","These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions, as well as increase digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners.","As an integral part of this strategy, we just introduced and nLight ECLYPSE, a powerful cost effective capability that enhances our industry leading controls lighting controls by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total smart building solutions that unifies lighting, HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines our building programming, facilitates our smart multi-zone daylight harvesting and color tuning capabilities, and enhanced IoT access.","We believe the capabilities and ease of installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy Acuity is built is driving the evolution to smart buildings in smart cities and we're just getting started.","We expect our recent strategic acquisitions coupled with our aggressive internal investments will allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new nonresidential construction cycle. We've been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our - now almost 12,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving and solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our market expectations for the construction markets later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2017. Ricky?","Richard Reece","Thank you, Vern and good morning everyone. As Vern noted, we had a solid fourth quarter and full-year performance on virtually all metrics including sales and earnings growth, profitability, and cash flow. I will add insight to our financial performance and not repeat the information already provided by Vern.","As Vern mentioned earlier we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2016 and 2015 which we find useful to add back in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Primarily, due to the impact of the four acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation expense since we used restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to align the interests of key leaders of acquired businesses with those of the shareholders.","Special charges as we streamlined and integrated recent acquisitions and an impairment of intangible assets as we rationalized acquired trade names. We believe adjusting for these items in providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you'll find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.","In addition, many of our peer companies especially as we become more of a technology company make these same adjustments. So it will help as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. During the fourth quarter and full year of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pretax special charge of $4.9 million and $15 million respectively for actions initiated to streamline the organization, including the integration of recent acquisitions.","These streamlining activities included the consolidation of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. We realize net savings in excess of $4 million in fiscal year 2016 and expect to achieve annual savings of twice the amount of the special charge our approximately $30 million and we believe will be at this run rate by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2017. We anticipate incurring additional cost associated with further integration activities of recent acquisitions in fiscal year 2017, although the amount and exact timing has not yet been determined.","During the fourth quarter we finalized our allocation of the purchase price for the Distech acquisition and refine the preliminary allocations for Juno, Geometri and DGLogik acquisitions. Consequently, we reduced our fourth quarter acquisition-related amortization expense by $4.4 million from the amount recorded in the third quarter. We expect to finalize the remaining purchase price allocations by the end of our second quarter of fiscal year 2017.","Our current estimate is that acquisition related amortization expense will be approximately $5.8 million per quarter in fiscal year 2017. To provide full transparency of this non-cash cost, we will continue to quantify this amount each quarter as part of our adjusted results.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.8% compared with 35% in the fourth quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to once again be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","We did an excellent job this year managing operating working capital defined as receivables, plus inventories less payables, as our operating working capital was 38 days which we believe is industry leading. In fiscal year 2016, we spent $83.7 million on capital expenditures compared with $56.5 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth including tooling for new products, expansion in our electronics and painting capacity, and build-outs of our innovation and technology center in a new production facility which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017.","At August 31, 2016 we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $413.2 million, a decrease of $343.6 million since August 31, 2015. This decrease was due primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $623.2 million and the capital expenditures of $83.7 million, as well as to pay dividends to shareholders of $22.9 million. Our total debt outstanding was $355.2 million at August 31, 2016 and we had more cash than debt at the year end.","We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at August 31, 2016 under our credit facility which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility and will continue to see the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you and I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Overall the economy in North America and certain markets we serve in Europe continue to move along at a measured but sometimes inconsistent pace. This year's Presidential election in the U.S. and event such as U.K. referendum thought to exit European Union continue to create uncertainty and volatility. This uncertainty and volatility always has the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment which in turn could negatively impact global economic activity.","That notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company's prospects for continued profitable growth. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observations for 2017. First we estimate the broad lighting market in North America which represents 97% of our total net sales will grow in the mid-to-upper single digit range for fiscal 2017 reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation and retrofit activity. Again the favorable trend in our September order rate seems to support this continued level of improvement.","Further we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business leading indicators for the North American market such as the architectural billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces while residential construction continues to grow nicely.","Excluding the price of certain LED components which are expected to continue to decline and steel costs which we continue - which we expect to continue to rise, we do not anticipate significant changes in other material and component cost over the next 12 months. We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions.","Further we expect employee related cost to continue to rise primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising healthcare cost. Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are always unpredictable.","Another observation, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation and price product and sales channel mix, as well as current dilutive - the current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as sales volume grows, as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies including cost savings related to recent actions taken to accelerate the integration of acquisitions made in 2016.","Our record adjusted gross profit margin in fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential it is a very positive picture. Additionally while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly and most importantly, we expect our overall growth rate to continue to meaningfully outperform those of the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building management solutions that for example connect smart devices with smart phones for many different end-users, as well as our growing electronic component and software capabilities.","We are experiencing strong interest from many of our customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base of connected devices by the end of calendar 2016.","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from our acquisitions of Distech, Geometri, and DGLogik, which we believe will meaning expand our addressable market and add significantly greater broad-based holistic solutions align customers to optimize the performance of their facilities.","While we're very early in this game, we're seeing positive results in our growth rates our Tier .3 and Tier 4 categories as well as the implementation of our IOT Solutions. Further the addition of Juno has meaningfully expanded and strengthened our lighting portfolio including both down and track lighting as well as enhancing our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels. We're still in the early stages of fully optimizing the potential of Juno as part of our portfolio.","Our company-wide strategy is straightforward expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns.","This all takes focus and resources, we are investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast changing industry because we see great future opportunity.","Through these investments, we've significantly expanded our addressable market. Our record growth supports this view. As I've said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size to more efficient and effective solutions, we believe this is particularly compelling as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet of Things.","We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building management industries some of which could grow by 50% or more over the next few years will provide us with significant growth potential. As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we're positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. You line is now open.","Rich Kwas","Vernon, I just want to follow up on the installed base for the network fixtures. So on the quadrupling, do we - is it off the 200,000 base or is that imply that it's off a lower base and that by calendar yearend it will be higher than 200,000, but don't use that as the guide or the benchmark.","Vernon Nagel","No. It's off of the 12 million square feet and 200,000 installed white enabled Beacons. The business and what we're experiencing there is just fantastic. There is interest in many different verticals and so we're in various stages of pilot programs to larger - much larger test programs all the way to installation.","So it's happening and it's happening at a very interesting pace. We think that over the longer term, and please I don't mean next quarter to quarter after that, I am talking pick the next 1,000 days, I think you're going to see a meaningful change and a meaningful adoption of these Tier 3 solutions that Acuity is offering and then the opportunity for it to enable Tier 4 revenues for Acuity.","We just introduced nLight ECLYPSE, which is truly in our view a game changing solution set. It doesn't exist in the industry today where it provides a unified system, not an integrated system, but a solution set that ties together HVAC, lighting, access, security and also provides a great capability to collect data and push that to the cloud and then push that back through the IoT type solutions set.","So early, early, early stages of all this, but we're now seeing the growth and it's very exciting for us.","Rich Kwas","Okay. So substantially you've seen some benefit already but then it continues to build, a way to interpret that. So and then a quick question on incremental margin as we think about 2017, so the target always been mid to high 20s and you\u2019ve got some investments going on and you\u2019ve got restructuring.","So, I guess how do we think about the cadence of improvement because the last couple quarters there has been some noise in the numbers as it relates to cost and what not and obviously you had some loss sales this quarter. So do we think about this rebounding to the mid to high 20s in a fairly quick manner or just more of a gradual recovery as the restructuring benefit to play out?","Vernon Nagel","Well, I think there are variable contribution margins off of the - if you were the legacy business and were about the anniversary Juno here December 10, Ricky?","Richard Reece ","Yes.","Vernon Nagel","So, those variable contribution margins should continue to roll, we still have some work to do. We took actions this quarter that obviously impacted this quarter but we did that because we really wanted to accelerate both our growth capacity, our capacity to service the growth that we are seeing and we\u2019ll continue to see we believe.","And number two to drive productivity so that we can continue to have the type of variable contribution margins that we expect and then what we expect as we said before is kind of that mid to upper 20s. It doesn\u2019t mean that we won\u2019t exceed it from time to time but this quarter is a great example in spite of the challenges that we had with some of the streamlining issues we still delivered, 26%, 27% variable contribution margin. For the full year 2016, we were about 30%.","So our expectation is that even as we anniversary the acquisitions, we'll still be in the very high rate while continuing to invest. And just to be clear these numbers of pretty staggering, Acuity in its legacy business in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, we added a 100 people. We added 100 salaried people. We\u2019re investing heavily because we see huge growth coming our way.","Over the last literally year including acquisitions, we\u2019ve added almost 700 salary heads to our capabilities. This is a enormous capability. In the last quarter we added almost 1,500 hourly people, now that number will come down a little bit as we streamline the operations that really was what caused us to experience both labor shortages and just on boarding issues as we ramp up the business because again we see very, very robust growth.","All this means as we think about 2017, our expectation is to continue to deliver a very robust variable contribution margin that is in that mid to upper 20% range while investing in our business.","Rich Kwas","All right, thank you for the color. I\u2019ll pass it on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Jeremie Capron from CLSA. Your line is now open.","Jeremie Capron","Thanks. Good morning. I wanted to ask about what you are seeing in terms of the regulation landscape here. Any particular regulations you are keeping an eye on? And also in terms of incentives in various parts of the country, if you could shed some color on this, it would be appreciated.","Vernon Nagel","Sure. Ricky do you want take that one?","Richard Reece","Yes, we continue to see primarily from utility companies incentives been offered and as you might imagine it\u2019s been more lucrative in the higher cost areas of those coast, east coast as well as west coast. Some of those have diminished a bit from the rights we\u2019ve seen in previous years but continue to see pretty aggressive incentives been offered by the utility companies and then there are some tax accelerated benefits as well.","On the regulatory front, continue to see most of the states implementing building coded that mandates certain levels of efficiencies much of it is around the level of control of lights or you need to put occupancy sensors and take advantage or turning lights off on a room and stay well or in a areas not been occupied but as in the case of Title 24 in California you are seeing many of them go beyond that and start mandating how much you're allowed to consume per square foot and the level of integration of the entire office power grid.","So the regulatory front continues to move forward and we see it as another catalyst for growth.","Jeremie Capron","Great, thanks. And going back to your commentary around incremental margins going forward, can you help us understand the difference in terms of profitability between your higher tiered solutions and the simpler LED solutions because, as you highlighted, the increase in your cost base has been pretty significant yet margins continue to grind up. I'm trying to understand the mix effect here as Tier 3 and over - it starts to move the needle.","Vernon Nagel","Sure. Well you're seeing our margins continue to improve for a number of reasons one, incremental volume, number two the mix as we migrate more to migrate as the percentage of what Tier 3 and Tier 4 is de minimis right now but ultimately we expected to be a nice margin contributor because you have invested the cost, it's almost a software related, so the margins should come off that be very consistent with other companies providing those types of capabilities.","So our expectation is that our gross profit margin will continue to improve over time and we will be able to continue to leverage as we hit sort of a plateauing probably sometime in late 2017, early 2018 of some of these investments and then the revenues that will be returning off those will make those the percentage of SDA become smaller relative to where it is today.","We finished the year on an adjusted basis with SDA about 26.9%, let's call it 27% margins at the gross profit level were about 43.7%. Again our expectation is that our gross profit margins will continue to improve and our SDA we will continue to be able to leverage that.","So the best way to think about our business is still in terms of variable contribution margin. We are still investing so the investing is slowing down it had because we have made significant investments in 2016.","I would also say that when I look at our total cost for salaried associates, as well as our total cost for ROE associates as a percentage of our sales, those things continue to be flattish and so that's why you're again seeing margins improve over the 2015 time period whether it would be at operating profit or at the gross profit level.","So we're getting the leverage, it is coming through the variable contribution margin, and yet we're still investing heavily in our business because again we see really tremendous growth opportunity over the next decade.","Jeremie Capron","Thanks very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Ryan Merkel","Thanks. So first question I had is the sales issue from the supply chain fully behind you in September? And then secondly, could you comment on if the September order growth rate is still outperforming the industry?","Vernon Nagel","I will take the last one first, the September order rate for Acuity is meaningfully outperforming the industry as we pointed out. Number two, your first question, the issue was we knew we were going to have to accelerate the consolidation of some of our manufacturing capabilities. We knew we were going to have to free up some capacity in key manufacturing facilities, so we decided during the quarter to make that investment to accelerate those efforts and so the sheer act of ramping up and attracting talent into the organization, I\u2019m talking about hourly talent was a challenge particularly in a couple of areas because those areas are also experiencing growth from other companies moving into the market.","We knew that was going to happen, we anticipate it but truthfully as we were ramping up the whole notion of the number of - sheer number of folks that we needed and then the training side of it resulted in us not wanting to ship products because we want to make sure that the quality was there and all of those issues. So we believe that we lost roughly $25 million. It's an estimate of lost orders and the lost shipments during the quarter and our guess is just a guess that it probably cost us 70 bps of operating profit margin in total.","So you can understand the magnitude but we had to bite the bullet, we did it, we believe it's behind us, we think there maybe some just carry over lingering effect, there is orders ramp back up. Our order rates suggest that it's behind us. Our productive output is pretty close back to where it was in terms of our efficiencies and our effectiveness. So we're not expecting any of the lingering issues to have a material impact on our first quarter results.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. That's helpful. And then, secondly, you are seeing very strong growth of Tier 3. It was 40% this year, I think you said. And based on some of the commentary, it sounds like this growth rate could accelerate in 2017. Am I reading that correctly?","Richard Reece","Well, I think our mix of business continues to evolve. You know we are very focused on selling all tiers and selling value in all of those tiers. We do well in Tier 1 and 2 both from a sales perspective, as well as of margin perspective but the Tier 3 solutions particularly those that are enabled or capable of enabling the Internet of Things really are very exciting for us and we see more and more people wanting to bring those together.","And truthfully this is why we introduced nLight ECLYPSE, it's a very, very powerful lighting building automation system that come together in a way that is unified. So there's no steps that others have to take, you don't have to worry about whether the mechanical folks or whether the electrical folks are going to work together, that's the beauty of this solution set and it can enable the Internet of Things and so we believe that more and more folks as the specification cycle starts it's normal routine, we believe that by midyear you're going to see orders ramping up for these things.","So again this is what gives us confidence and optimism that we should be able to meaningfully outperform the growth rates of the markets that we generally serve.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. Very good. I will pass it on. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Quealy from Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open.","John Quealy","Good morning, folks. First, I'm sorry if I missed this, but did you give an update on the Target stores deployment relationship? I think last quarter we were talking about 300 or 400 stores at least through that quarterly period, but could you give us an update there?","Vernon Nagel","Sure, we are on track and things are moving along as expected and very excited about not only what Target is doing but what other folks not only other retailers in different sub verticals if you will, but with other verticals are doing we have just a lot of activity going on in lot of different places.","John Quealy","Okay. Thanks. And my follow-up, in terms of the acceleration of some of the footprint issues you did this quarter, the M&A integration at Distech as a standalone, can you talk about your bench strength in terms of being able to integrate more businesses? Does that limit your M&A appetite in 2017? If you could just talk a little bit more there. Thanks, folks.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you for the question. No, our acquisition appetite is quite robust. Whenever you make acquisitions of companies that are add-ons like Juno for example, it just gives a company like Acuity which is has a robust supply chain, the opportunity to leverage its efficiencies and so sometimes you have to move things around to be able to do that, you hope that they always go perfectly, I think we get a good job, we just caught a little bit of a perfect storm. Some of our main facilities are in locations where the growth rate is robust because they're just great locations to be in and so as we are ramping up, the number of people I had mentioned earlier, just the whole notion of bringing people on board, training them and facilitating all that was a challenge but it was a temporary challenge.","I think you companies have the skill and capability to do it as effectively and as efficiently as we've done. This was basically a 60 day, 90 day type issue where we've done some meaningful things that will have a huge impact on the profitability of our business going forward, as well as our ability to serve customers and to expand into new markets.","The Distech acquisition and its integration is moving along exceptionally well because they continue to focus on their core businesses. Engineering departments are working together in a way to introduce solution sets like nLight ECLYPSE. That's never existed in the market before. We are meeting an unmet need. So it will take a while for those sales to ramp up as the specification cycle works its way through as we train people, as people become committed to it.","But no our appetite for acquisitions continues and while I'm disappointed that we lost some revenues this quarter, I just been very pleased that how aggressively we attack these things because we do see robust growth now in lighting side, but the building management side we see growth in Juno product lines that they brought to us and we see growth in the combination of Acuity and Juno. So we're very bullish about what we see on a go-forward basis.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer. Your line is now open.","Christopher Glynn","Good morning. With all the industry changes and the repositioning of the portfolio and the project groups to those dynamics to digital lighting controls, maybe some operational disruption was even a little overdue. Wondering if you could comment on that thought and just around the risk going forward? I know you already touched on it, but is there any kind of backdrop for legacy product obsolescence and challenges in managing that?","Richard Reece","No Chris, that really is not the issue at all. We always go through product lifecycle management I don't see any of this current environment being any different because of how our supply chain works. We don't have legacy fixed assets because we don't make lamps, we don't make many things that require heavy investment. We are a designed and procurer and assembler of product to meet our specifications.","So the investments that we have been making have really to - been to expand if you will our physical capacity in some areas because of the growth our electronics business is just on fire, it's doing exceptional work. But so I don't see any technical obsolescence.","As we think about the moves that we took in the fourth quarter, it was really about training people and bringing people on board and then stabilizing that process. We added an enormous number of folks as I had mentioned earlier in the call. So I think we have managed it exceedingly well, I wish we had managed even better.","Typically we do these things and view the shareholders don't really see a blip, this time it was pretty big. And so the consolidation of what we've done, we believe we will have huge benefits on a go forward basis.","So again I don't really see much in the way of issues, it's training, it's development of our people, we are good at that, it just happened very, very quickly because we made the decision to accelerate, not go slow but go quickly because we believe that the growth particularly on the installed base renovation and retrofit activity is a huge opportunity for Acuity.","We've introduced some new products and solutions sets that really go after that market even more aggressively. So we're ramping up our capacity and we made the decision to do that in a location where it would have its permanent home, not doing places where it would be temporary. So that's caused us to want to accelerate this activity because we see great future growth going forward.","Christopher Glynn","Okay. And then just wanted to touch on the idea of using your eldoLED driver or some industry standard potential. Just wondering how that's rolling out and what the longer-term implications and role of your driver technology are for the portfolio.","Vernon Nagel","Sure, that market like really all markets it's based on features and benefits and capabilities of your solution set and how you have used technology knowhow to create a difference. I believe that. We use other light engines as well from other folks. So the notion of creating industry-standard a little different in that we want to offer features and benefits where our eldoLED driver for many of our partners, our friends and we want to enable more. It really provides a capability that is unmatched in the industry.","So it's a solution set that people would identify with and by virtue of its features and benefits we would hope that they would prefer that over others and then therefore it becomes the driver of choice for many applications.","As we think about the Internet of Things and how we enable more folks to participate, we want people to use our driver so that it can be part of a holistic system and their capabilities, whoever they happen to be can participate in a set that an architect lighting designer or building owner would like to have including their luminaires.","I wish I could tell you we make every luminaire, known to man. We don't and so our branding strategy is to get others that filling gaps and have opportunities to participate on the overall system to be part of that digital backbone and Acuity can then guarantee to the building owner that it's going to work and work the way they want and it will do everything that they want so, that\u2019s really what we\u2019re driving towards.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks. And quick clarification. On the expectation for gross margin to expand over time, I assume that comment applies discreetly to fiscal 2017 as well?","Vernon Nagel","Sure, we always are looking to continue to drive and improve our margins. We have a long history of doing that and our expectations are high for 2017.","Christopher Glynn","Thanks Vern.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brian Lee from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.","Brian Lee","Thanks for taking the questions. Maybe first off, Vern, you mentioned less reliance on non-res new construction during your prepared remarks. Was hoping you can maybe help quantify that to some degree. What's your mix today between the new construction and renovation and then how much do you think it could skew toward renovation in fiscal 2017 and then maybe over the longer term?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. So Brian the way we look at the market as we say there is new construction and we all know well how to do that, there is an architect, lightening designer, engineer, building owner, electrical contractor, electrical distributor.","Next portion of the market is plan renovation that's where someone again will hire architect, engineer, lightening designer and they\u2019ll go after and they\u2019ll say, I'm going to remodel a wing of my hospital, great. That looks like new construction to us.","And then there is this world of what we call unplanned renovation. It\u2019s what exist out there every day and you use your office every day and you don\u2019t think about the lights that are above you, it's that world that we\u2019re looking to attack in a much more aggressive and holistic way bringing to them solutions that will cause them to say, yup, I want to go from having analogue lighting to digital lighting, yup, I want to go from having an analogue, HVAC building management system to a digital building management system.","Our view is that the installed base and I've given these statistics before DOE estimates that there is 100 billion square feet of building space in the U.S. A few years ago our guesstimate was that it was about $3 a square foot to convert, $2.50 a square foot for fixtures and another $0.50 square foot for controls.","We believe today that with our solution sets, the unified nLight ECLYPSE system for example, the ability to enable Internet of Things to collect data off of this to provide many more features and benefits of data and what it can do in the space to help a building owner optimize what they're doing as a unique and compelling value proposition.","So the conversion of that install base and the value of that install base we think is much higher than what we had originally estimated two or three times higher. And then you put in that outdoor which is another third the size of that, it\u2019s a huge marketplace. DOE also estimates that less than 15% of the outdoor market has been converted today, less than 5% of the indoor market has converted today.","We believe that to be true. I mean just look in all office drive down the street and you will see the tremendous amount of opportunity. So what Acuity is doing, what investments that we have made in ramping up not only our headcount but also the acquisitions that we've made very strategic in nature to give us capability to go after that installed base in a very aggressive way.","It's equally applicable to new construction as well as planned renovation. But the unplanned renovation market that is huge, I mean $800 billion or more than that. So that's what we are targeting as a growth opportunity. We continue to do well in new construction and planned renovation, we see opportunities for continued growth there, we think that we are taking share in that space but where we think we can really turbocharge our business is to get after the unplanned renovation. And that's what gives us enthusiasm for outsized growth relative to the growth rates of the markets that we serve, as well as being less dependent upon new construction by itself.","Brian Lee","All right. Thanks. That insight is super helpful. Maybe just a quick follow-up on mix. LEDs, you mentioned, is now approximately two-thirds of sales. I think you have said in the past it's in theory probably not likely that LED becomes the entire business mix. There's always a place for some amount of traditional lighting technologies.","What do you think is the upper limit on LED mix for you because it does seem like you've grown a lot faster in that segment than expected. And so just wondering how close you might be getting to what you might consider an upper limit as you see it? Thank you.","Vernon Nagel","Sure. So LEDs today represent almost two-thirds of our total revenues but I just want to emphasize that Acuity has revenues other than fixture products obviously Distech it's a simple example that we also sell emergency lighting, we will sell poles for outdoor lighting.","So when we think about where our mix actually is for our lighting business, and we sell control systems too. It is a much higher percentage than what it means to the overall sales. So ultimately I see Acuity sales continuing to grow in multiple areas including selling more luminaires but I think LED as a percentage, I don\u2019t know what the exact number will be that will hit a fixed percentage because we\u2019ll have been converted virtually all to LED within our luminaire business. I still think that that is a few years away but I believe that will happen particularly as LEDs just become more efficacious and they are doing that.","So I think that for our business, I don\u2019t know what the exact percentage will be because we sell other things and we want to sell those other things, those other items we will continue to grow. I mean our building management systems which tie now where we have nLight ECLYPSE in a unified way with HVAC and other lighting and so and so forth. We expect that to grow fairly significantly.","So it will continue as a percentage of the total and make LEDs. We will hold their percentage to our total and there will be other technologies that will come out there that won't be directly LED that will also continue to sell and there will be a small portion of our business as well.","Brian Lee","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, everyone. Thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the longer term continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support."],"645":["Acuity Brands, Inc. (NYSE:AYI) Q2 2018 Earnings Conference Call April  4, 2018 10:00 AM ET","Executives","Vern Nagel - Chairman, President, and CEO","Ricky Reece - EVP and CFO","Dan Smith - SVP, Treasurer and Secretary","Analysts","Reuben Garner - Seaport Global Securities","Rick Kwas - Wells Fargo","Ryan Merkel - William Blair","Sophie Karp - Guggenheim Securities","Tim Wojs - Robert W. Baird","Operator","Good morning and welcome to Acuity Brands' Fiscal 2018 Second Quarter Financial Conference Call. After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","And I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Thank you. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2018 second quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We are webcasting today's conference call on our web site at acuitybrands.com. I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now, let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments, and then we will answer your questions. While we made progress on improving our top line growth in the second quarter, particularly against the backdrop of a continued weak non-residential construction market, our profitability performance was below our expectations. I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make few comments on the key highlights for the second quarter of 2018.","Net sales for the second quarter were $832 million, an increase of over 3% compared with the year ago period. Reported operating profit was $88 million compared with $108 million in the year ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was $2.33 compared with $1.53 in the year ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for certain special items, as well as certain other add backs necessary for our results to be comparable between periods, as Ricky will explain later in the call.","In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of 2018 was $103.8 million compared to adjusted operating profit of $123.9 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 16%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 12.5%, a decrease of 290 basis points compared with the margin reported in the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.89, up 7% from the year-ago period.","For the first six months of fiscal 2018, net cash provided by operating activities was $178 million compared with $90 million provided in the year ago period. During the quarter, we spent $194 million to repurchase 1.2 million shares of our stock. Nonetheless, we closed the quarter with $230 million in cash on hand.","Looking at some specific details for the quarter, net sales grew 3.4% over the year ago period, driven by an increase in net sales volume of over 6%, and an approximate 1% favorable impact from foreign exchange rates, partially offset by 3.5% for unfavorable changes in product prices and the mix of products sold.","The increase in sales volume was primarily driven by greater shipments of our Atrius-based luminaires to certain customers in key channels, as well as growth for certain high volume, LED based fixtures with popular form factors, primarily for applications on smaller projects.","Sales of LED luminaires make up more than two-thirds of our total net sales, which as you know, includes the sale of non-fixture related products and solutions as well.","There were two key areas that negatively impacted our net sales volume this quarter. We experienced declines in shipments in the non-residential construction market, primarily for larger projects, where demand remained soft, and lower shipments through the home center showroom channel.","Net sales through the home center showroom channel, which made up more than 10% of our total net sales in the year ago period, declined to approximately 11% this quarter. While changes in price and product mix impacted net sales in this channel, due to the nature of the more basic, lesser featured products sold through these customers. We believe the decline in net sales was primarily due to changes in the in-house branding strategies, being deployed by certain customers for Select products in certain categories. We believe this shift will continue over the next few quarters, potentially impacting our results in a similar manner.","Further, overall net sales were impacted by unfavorable price mix, primarily due to changes in both product mix, which included substitutions to lower priced alternatives, and channel mix, which included declines in shipments to larger commercial projects noted earlier, which generally have a mix of higher-priced solutions. Price mix was also impacted by lower pricing on certain LED luminaires, reflecting a decline in certain LED component costs, as well as increased competition, primarily for more basic lesser featured products.","While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of changes in the price and mix of products sold, we estimate the impact on net sales due to price mix, is due more or less equally to changes in product and channel mix, as well as changes in product prices.","As such, we continue to accelerate the expansion of our product portfolio to more effectively and profitably compete in that portion of the market, where features and performance are less important, we will relaunch our Contractor Select portfolio, which will include many new products, incorporating certain attributes of differentiation, but at competitive price points, that we believe will have great appeal to both the commercial pro and the residential consumers for their new construction and renovation projects.","While this expanded portfolio, we believe, can offer either more choices to customers served in these markets, that would prefer our innovative and affordable Juno and Lithonia Lighting branded solutions, to products offered by others. We will begin shipping these solutions in early summer.","Regarding overall market demand for luminaires in North America, we believe demand declined once again this quarter. While available market data does not line up perfectly with our quarters, initial information from numerous forecasting organizations, while varied, suggest shipments of lighting fixtures in the United States were flat to down low single digits when compared with the year ago period. We believe this is the third quarter in a row, where demand for luminaires in U.S. was down compared with the same quarter one year earlier.","Nonetheless, excluding our specific issues within the home center showroom channel, we were still able to grow our net sales in the U.S. and Canada by more than 4% this quarter, outpacing the negative growth rate of the overall lighting industry. I will comment more on our expectations for the balance of 2018 later in the call.","Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building management solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces, have allowed us to continue to gain overall share in the North American market this quarter. Particularly against the backdrop of a soft market environment. As I noted earlier in the call, this is particularly true of certain key verticals, where demand for our Atrius-enabled luminaires continues to grow rapidly.","Our profitability measures for the second quarter were certainly below our expectations. They were impacted by continued tepid market conditions and the impact from changes in price mix noted earlier. Our adjusted operating profit for the quarter was $103.8 million, down approximately 16% compared with a year ago period, while adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was 12.5%, down 290 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period. The decrease in adjusted operating profit margin was primarily due to no variable contribution margin earned on the higher sales, and the increase in selling, distribution and administrative expenses, both in dollars and as a percentage of net sales.","Gross profit margin for the second quarter was 40.2%, a decrease of 150 basis points compared with adjusted gross profit margin reported in the year ago period. Gross profit and gross profit margin were negatively impacted by unfavorable price mix, foreign currency, and higher input costs for certain commodity related items, particularly steel and certain oil based components. This was partially offset by higher sales volume noted earlier, lower costs for certain components, primarily for LED fixtures, and productivity improvements within our supply chain.","We continue to aggressively take actions to enhance our overall competitiveness and improve our profitability, including accelerating programs to introduce new products with more appropriate cost structures that we believe will lessen the impact of price mix, efforts to reduce costs on existing products, and to drive overall productivity improvements.","Next, adjusted SDA expenses were up $19.2 million compared with the year ago period. Adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales was 27.8% in the second quarter, an increase of 150 basis points from a year ago period. The increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher freight costs to support the increase in net sales, and greater employee related costs, including higher compensation expense, rising healthcare, and an increased number of associates compared with the year ago period.","Greater employee related costs accounted for more than half of the increase in total SDA expense this quarter, when compared with the year ago period. We expect this higher level of employee related costs to continue in the second half of fiscal 2018.","Our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.89 compared to $1.77 recorded in the year ago period. The increase was primarily due to the favorable impact on income tax for the new tax law, as Ricky will explain later in the call, and lower average shares outstanding due to the stock repurchases in the past year, partially offset by a decline in operating profit in the quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on a few important accomplishments this quarter. On the strategic and technology front, we continue to make positive strides, setting stage for what we believe will be strong revenue growth and profitability over the long term.","While sale data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise, we believe sales in our Tier 3 and 4 categories encompassing our holistic integrated solutions, were up well over 20% this quarter and represent almost 15% of our total sales. As a reminder, Tier 3 includes the sale of our network and IoT enabled luminaires, while Tier 4 includes recurring revenues for services, including from our Atrius IoT solution set. The growth in our combined Tier 3 and 4 was driven primarily by greater shipments of Atrius-based luminaires in key verticals, as demand for these lighting based IoT solutions continue to expand.","From a commercial perspective, we have accelerated the number of Atrius enabled deployments, and increased active programs with several of the largest U.S. based retailers, as well as other key vertical applications, including certain types of public buildings.","We believe these commitments and orders from customers accelerated in expansion to their current platforms, as well as customers moving beyond pilot programs to implementation will afford us the opportunity to meaningfully expand our installed base in Atrius-enabled systems in future quarters, and this does not include the potential growth opportunities for new customers and partners, again, from which there is great interest in deploying our lighting platforms, enabling the utilization of our Atrius-based solutions.","Also in the quarter, we completed the acquisition of Lucid, a data analytic software company, to enhance our expanding portfolio on building management services. Lucid, based on Oakland, California, has approximately 40 associates, and would be part of our Atrius team.","Lastly, our Board authorized a repurchase of up to 6 million shares or approximately 15% of the company's outstanding stock, reflecting our long term optimism for the company's prospects. Additionally, our Board believes that the repurchases of the company's stocks supports our objective to maximize long term shareholder value, while continuing to fund investments to better serve our customers, grow our business and improve our operating and financial performance. Ricky will have additional comments on this in a moment.","We have been able to create these capabilities, while providing industry leading results because of the dedication and resolve of our approximately 12,500 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our market expectations for the construction markets later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky, before I make a few closing comments. Thank you.","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning everyone. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2018 and 2017, which we find useful to add back, in order for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures for the second quarter of both fiscal year 2018 and 2017. Adjusted results exclude the impact of amortization expense for acquired intangible assets, share based payments expense, acquisition related items, special charges for streamlining activities, and an income tax net benefit for discrete items associated with the Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017.","We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance.","In addition, many of our peer companies, especially as we become more of a technology company, make similar adjustments, so it will help, as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was a benefit of 23.1%. This benefit included $31.2 million or $0.75 per diluted EPS of net discrete items associated with the U.S. Income Tax Cuts. Primarily, due to an income tax benefit from the remeasurement of the company's net U.S. deferred tax liabilities to a reduced federal rate, partially offset by an unfavorable impact related to the taxation of the company's accumulated unremitted foreign earnings.","Excluding this discrete benefit, the adjusted effective tax rate was 16.9% compared with 32.6% in the second quarter of last year. We currently estimate that our blended effective income tax rate, before discrete items, were approximately 26% to 28% for the remainder of fiscal 2018, and 23% to 25% for fiscal 2019. As these lower rates reflect, the passage of the new U.S. Tax Law will have a meaningfully positive impact on lowering taxes paid by Acuity, thus enhancing our future earnings and cash flow. The impact of the tax legislation may differ from the current estimates, possibly materially, due to among other things, changes in interpretation or assumptions the company has made. Guidance that may be issued and actions of the company may make as a result of the tax legislation.","On February 12, 2018, using cash on hand, we acquired Lucid Design Group headquartered in Oakland, California. Lucid provides a data and analytic platform to make data driven decisions to improve building efficiency and drive energy conservation and savings. Its SaaS based building OS platform enables owners, operators and occupants to find powerful insights in their building operations data to make buildings more efficient and improve the performance of the people and businesses that rely on them. Lucid's operating results and preliminary amounts related to the acquisition accounting, were included in the consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition, and are not material.","We generated $178.3 million of net cash flow, provided by operating activities, during the six months ended February 28, 2018, compared with $90 million for the year ago period, an increase of $88.3 million. This significant increase in cash flow compared with the year ago period, was due primarily to lower operating working capital requirements, and lower variable incentive compensation payments. Operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventory less payables, decreased approximately $26 million during the first six months of fiscal 2018.","At February 2018, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $229.8 million, a decrease of $81.3 million since August 31, 2017. This decrease was due primarily to cash used to repurchase common stock, to fund acquisitions, to invest in plant and equipment, and to pay dividends. We repurchased 1.2 million shares for $194.3 million during the second quarter of fiscal 2018. Our investment and capital expenditures was $20.9 million for the first half of fiscal 2018, a decrease of almost $15 million compared with the prior year. We currently expect to invest approximately 2% of net sales in capital expenditures in fiscal 2018.","As Vern mentioned earlier, our Board just authorized the repurchase of up to 6 million shares of common stock. The extent and timing of actual stock repurchases will be subject to various factors, including stock price, company performance, expected future market conditions and other possible uses of cash, such as acquisitions. We believe the repurchase of all of the shares under the approved authorization, within a 12 month period, would require additional resources beyond our current available cash and borrowing capacity. Therefore, we may incur additional borrowings and increase our leverage, to accommodate such repurchases.","The Board believes the repurchase of the company stock supports our objective to maximize long term shareholder value. We further believe, because of our strong cash flow and availability to additional financing, we should be able to continue to fund investments to better serve our customers, grow our business, both organically and via potential acquisitions and strategic partnerships, and improve our operating and financial performance.","Our total debt outstanding was $356.9 million at February 2018. Our debt-to-capitalization at February 2018 was 17.9% and net debt-to-capital was 7.2%. We had additional borrowing capacity of $244.7 million at February 28, 2018, under our credit facility, which does not expire until August 2019.","Based on our cash on hand, additional committed borrowing capacity and our expected short term cash flow from operations, less cash needed to fund operations as currently planned, make anticipated capital investments, pay quarterly dividends as currently anticipated, pay principal and interest on borrowings as currently scheduled, make required contributions to our employee benefit plans, and fund possible acquisitions, we anticipate over the next few months, having approximately $300 million available for share repurchase. As I mentioned previously, to be able to purchase the full 6 million shares authorized over the next 12 months, we would need to obtain additional financing. The type of debt instruments, amount terms, and timing of additional borrowings would be dependent on the extent and timing of share repurchase activity.","Thank you, and I will turn it back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. The current weakness in the lighting industry has created a challenging environment for management to drive short term financial performance, while continuing to invest in attractive long term opportunities. Nonetheless, we are optimistic regarding our long term future, despite this persistent market softness, which has impacted our short term financial performance.","We are often asked about the vitality and conditions of the key end markets we serve. On one hand, market data suggests that the overall growth rate of the U.S. lighting market over the last three quarters was down low single digits compared with the year ago periods. Many reasons have been cited for this softness, including among others, weak non-residential construction activity, lack of skilled labor, previous concerns over tax regulations, and current uncertainty regarding trade policies, substitutions to lower priced alternative products, and pricing pressures in some end markets for certain less featured products.","On the other hand, while we believe all of this is true to varying degrees, we continue to pull our vast customer base and channel partners, and from the majority, we continue to hear guarded optimism regarding the prospects for future growth. Generally speaking, the trades are busy, the backlogs are favorable.","As for our market expectations for the balance of 2018, we continue to see favorable trends in certain leading indicators, continue to hear from customers that large projects are set to release, and see some encouraging reports from third party forecasting organizations. Nonetheless, we continue to be cautious and believe overall market conditions could continue to be challenging for the near future, suggesting growth in the lighting fixture market may remain sluggish for the balance of fiscal 2018.","However, most importantly, we expect to continue to outperform the overall growth rate of the markets we serve, primarily in North America. While we expect the headwinds noted earlier in the home center\/showroom channel to continue to negatively impact our net sales in the near-term, we believe there is an opportunity for growth later in the calendar year, as we bring additional solutions to keep customers and take actions to expand our access to market in this important channel.","Further, we believe the sales of our Atrius-based luminaires within our Tier 3 and 4 categories will continue to expand. Though this can be lumpy at times, based on our various customers' renovation and new construction cycles.","Next, we believe that product substitutions to lower priced alternatives for certain products and portions of the market will continue, particularly for more basic, lesser featured products sold through certain channels, pressuring top line growth and potentially profitability.","Next, we believe the price of certain LED components will continue to decline, though at a decelerating pace, while certain other costs, including certain components and commodity costs, especially steel prices, as well as certain employee related costs, primarily due to compensation inflation and other related costs, will continue to increase. Our adjusted SDA costs as a percentage of net sales this quarter was 27.8%. We believe this percentage was at the high end of the range, as our second quarter net sales are usually our lowest of the four fiscal quarters.","We expect to mitigate the impact of some of these rising costs through certain pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and the implementation of programs to reduce product and other overhead costs, though the timing of these initiatives might lag the timing of these increased costs.","Additionally, our gross profit margin is influenced by several factors, including sales volume, innovation, components and commodities costs, market level pricing, and changes in the mix of products and sales channels. We are always striving to improve our profitability. However, we believe that for any meaningful margin improvement to occur, we will need to experience an acceleration of market demand, particularly for larger commercial projects. Also, we expect our gross margins to improve, once the introduction of our newest products and solution become a more meaningful portion of our revenues over the next several quarters. Our mix evolves as we execute our tiered solutions strategy, particularly for our Atrius-based solutions, and as we realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","Next, we continue to be leery of the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are always unpredictable.","So to be very clear, our focus is to garner additional top line growth, driven primarily by our ability to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve, continue to improve the mix of products and solutions, as we execute our tiered solutions strategy, and to leverage our fixed cost infrastructure to achieve targeted incremental margins to improve our overall profitability.","Lastly, we are focused on and very excited by the long term potential of the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting building management in our Atrius IoT platform and software solutions.","The world of data optimization targeted by our Atrius platform, is in the early beginnings, and we believe we are uniquely positioned to take full advantage of these high growth opportunities.","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solutions strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world, is an integral part of our overall long term growth strategy, to meaningfully expand our addressable market, by adding significantly greater, broad based holistic solutions that will allow our customers to optimize the performance of their connected intelligent buildings and campuses.","This all takes focus and resources. We are investing today to enhance and expand our core competencies, affording us the opportunity to excel over the long term in our fast changing industry, because we see great future opportunity.","As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry, as well as the building management systems market have the potential to experience significant growth over the next decade, because of continued opportunities for new construction, and more importantly, the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size, to more efficient and effective solutions.","As the market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, along with our Atrius platform, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries. Therefore, we remain bullish regarding the company's long term prospects for continued profitable growth, particularly as we bring more value added solutions to the market for both new construction, and the conversion of the installed base.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Matt McCall with Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open.","Reuben Garner","Thanks. Good morning. It's actually Reuben on for Matt. So a lot of moving parts with the margins right now. Can you kind of update us, I guess, if the current environment continues? I know you have got inflation and freight and steel and employee costs. Can you help us with maybe where you are expecting contribution margins to be over the next year or two with the current environment?","Vern Nagel","Well, as we have pointed out in the prepared remarks, our focus is to really adjust the portfolio through new product introductions, both at the, if you will, lesser featured end of the market, as well as to continue to bring out solution sets that support the higher end of the market. Our Atrius-based solutions are in high demand. We are seeing very significant growth for these types of products. So we are looking to manage, if you will, the business in this, if you will, challenging environment. And so, I think you will see our margins, and as we said again in our prepared remarks, probably not change a great deal, unless we do see a pickup in some of the portions of the market, particularly for larger projects, where we typically enjoy higher margins, because of the differentiated nature of those products. So we are expecting that, by the way, to happen.","From an SDA perspective, I'd like to just make sure everyone understands that. While our costs are up, we have added headcount over the year ago period. The increase in our headcount over the last few quarters has really flattened out as we continue to leverage our structure. So we are seeing a period-over-period improvement. But SDA, as a percentage of sale on an adjusted basis were at 27.8%. Typically, we are in the upper 26s, call it say, 27%, but the second quarter is typically our lowest volume quarter, our lowest sales volume quarter. So as a percentage, the numbers are a bit higher.","As we look out into the third quarter and the fourth quarter, our expectation that SDA as a percentage of sales will come down more into the range that we typically have operated, which is in that, call it 26% to low 27% range. I would also caution folks that our third quarter is typically our highest expense quarter because we have certain events where we have like our national sales conference and we have light fair. These are expensive activities, and they typically occur in our third quarter.","Reuben Garner","Okay. And Vern, just to clarify, when you say you don't expect margins to change much unless you have an acceleration, is that from the Q2 levels or are you talking about on a year-over-year basis?","Vern Nagel","I think we are looking more on a year-over-year basis. Though our Q2 margins, obviously pressured compared to the year ago basis, were driven primarily by -- difficult for us to precisely gauge price versus mix, but we think in this particular quarter, it was about half and half.","If you go back and look at it historically, we have typically experienced price mix in the 1% to 2% range. We have gone above that, but typically, that has been price related, and so this quarter, we saw again compared to the year ago period, a channel mix and a product mix movement that was in addition to, if you will, price. And that channel mix has to do again with the larger project portion of the world, and we hear from lots of people, that backlogs are strong, activity is good, and that these projects will release. It just hasn't released. We have great market share there, we have great value propositions, but we are just not seeing the release. And so, while again, people are encouraged, until we actually get the order and then shipment, that's when we will declare that the markets are moving back in a more favorable way.","Reuben Garner","Okay. Great. Very helpful. And then, on the share repurchase program, can you help us with -- you kind of touched on a little bit in your prepared remarks, how you view share repurchase versus M&A today, and maybe do you have an updated leverage target, given the extent of the potential share repurchase program?","Vern Nagel","Let me take a quick answer, and then Ricky, please chime in. If I look back over the last decade or so, Acuity has really done, I think an excellent job of returning capital to shareholders in very shareholder friendly ways. We have purchased over $1 billion worth of shares, almost 15 million shares over the last decade plus. We have done acquisitions totaling about $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion. We have returned dividends of probably north of $300 million and CapEx of about $700 million.","So Acuity is always looking over the longer term for ways to optimize its return to shareholders. We are very optimistic about our long term growth opportunities. We see the technology side of our business really being in its nascent beginning. But yet, the optimism and the utilization is now starting to ramp up. We are very excited about that. So we are going to continue to invest in that, because we see it as a huge potential for us. So we want to make sure that we are balancing off, how do we invest in our business with the opportunity to take advantage of situations, where the marketplace in our view is misjudging, really the long term opportunities of this company. And so, this is why we are saying that it is -- we will continue to look to do share repurchases, because we see that as a long term valuation creating opportunity for our shareholders.","We are -- Ricky, if you look at our balance sheet, we have historically been underlevered relative to sort of our industry norms, and so this share repurchase really gives us the opportunity to have a capital structure that may be more consistent with industry norms.","Ricky Reece","Yeah, I would add on to that; on the leverage side, we clearly want to maintain our investment grade rating. We have had some preliminary discussions with the rating agencies and so forth around that. So leverage would still be in line with what you would expect for an investment grade company. But as Vern said, higher than the very low leverage we have had in the past.","So probably under two times leverage would be what you would expect versus us being more close to half turn of leverage in the past. So -- or willing to leverage up, I would say on the M&A, the pipeline continues to look good. We do have capability and the desire to continue to be active in M&A. We will be likely accessing additional capital, to make sure that we have the firepower, should we purchase the entire $6 million that we still have the firepower to be active in the M&A area. So I don't think our long term allocation of capital will change dramatically in terms of M&A and buying back shares, but as Vern said right now, the share repurchase looks like an attractive way to enhance shareholder value, and we believe we can do that, while continuing to be in the M&A market and seeking opportunities to increase value through M&A as well.","Vern Nagel","And let me just add one more comment, Ricky's intent would be to be opportunistic in the marketplace, to acquire shares, and do that over time.","Reuben Garner","Great. Thanks guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from Rick Kwas, Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open.","Rick Kwas","Hi. Good morning. Just a question on price mix Vern. So should we think about mix being the sort of headwind going forward, and in combination with price, the down three to four is the way to think about it, or at least over the next few quarters? It just seems to me that, from a mix standpoint, it's going to be a little bit of a struggle to lessen that burden over the next few quarters, given the comps you face, and given the import competition out there? So I think, considering that it's pretty important to gross margin and hence how the stock is going to behave over the next several quarters, how should we think about this to right size our thought process when I am trying to model this?","Vern Nagel","We believe that the pricing environment has for -- that certain portion of the market that, we will call it a lesser featured sort of lower valued market, pricing competition there has remained fairly consistent, it has been aggressive. And so, that is primarily where we are seeing, if you will, price -- we have price in some other areas. There is a little bit of product substitution that's also influencing that. But I would say that it's more the channel mix side of it. We are guessing. I mean, it's really difficult for us to precisely pin down the difference between price changes, as well as channel and product mix.","Now channel and product mix, which we guess to be approximately half of the 3.5%, so you can do the math around that. We think it's really the larger project side of the world, just continuing to be soft. When I look at our projects and our shipments in the projects, on Q2 over Q2, I mean, it represents the primary reason that we were down, if you will, in that area. So I see us competing very effectively, if you will, in the world of those lesser featured, lower value type products. Yeah, we have to tweak our portfolio, but we are pretty good at that.","When I look at our -- when we said that our volume was up about a little over 6%, and we look at our contribution margin off of that, it was consistent with what we see throughout our entire portfolio. So that's not the issue, it's that -- it's in price mix, half of it price, half of it mix, and the mix piece is really more -- we are just not seeing the uptick yet in larger projects. We believe that it will happen, but when will it happen, we are just being cautiously optimistic about it.","We are very excited about the growth rates that we are experiencing for our Atrius-enabled luminaires. But a lot of those products are finding their way into very large, if you will, buildings, whether its commercial retailers or whether it's large public facilities, airports, convention centers. So what happens typically, is that you are focused on shipping a lot of very similar type fixture. So the margin profile, the cost to serve that piece of business by the way, is just less. It's not that it's bad, it's just less. Its less than these larger projects that we see in the commercial world, where they are very complex. They are incorporating a great deal of different luminaires, control platforms, and they are easy to manage, and we are really good at it. And so that's just not happening. So that's the mix piece.","On the price piece, Ricky, we are seeing kind of the same.","Ricky Reece","We are not seeing lots of difference, we are seeing a little bit more substitution going on. But even in that substitution, while the price points may be lower, our gross margin profile, as a percentage, is still attractive, we are selling more of them. And we saw that in our world.","Vern Nagel","So I hope I am giving you some guidance that, for us, the opportunity to leverage our platform, is really built around two things; one, continuing to move our product portfolio to be competitive in that lower, less featured product portion of the market. But being ready to serve large jobs, and these jobs would be $50,000 and above kind of jobs, that are important to us.","Ricky Reece","I would just add to Vern's comment, that it's -- the price portion hasn't changed as much as I think it's the channel and product mix that got it to go up from one to two to the three to four. It's hard to predict, is that channel mix going to continue to be where it was this quarter or are we going to see the improvement which Vern highlighted in these major projects, that would better forecast where that price mix may go.","Rick Kwas","And then, do you feel you are losing share on the larger more specified projects?","Vern Nagel","No, not at all. We do not. Solution set [ph] portfolio is robust. Our access to that market through our agency partners is strong. It's interesting to us, when we specifically look at geographies and markets. I mean, it's a handful of markets also, that are experiencing fairly significant decline, and we know these markets. The Dodge data supports declines so on and so forth, and a lot of our agents in those key markets are -- they are the 900 pound gorillas. And so they are saying, we are busy, but there is just nothing that's releasing right now.","Rick Kwas","Okay. And then just a real quick one on tariffs; I know it's early days, but what are your thoughts around tariffs, the impact, as it relates to competition, as well as on margins in your business? I don't know what percentage of your LED kit you source in China appears to be on the list in terms of being affected by tariffs and then, that would affect import players as well. So just curious on how -- I know it's early, but just any broad thoughts on how you think the impact could shake out over the next few quarters?","Vern Nagel","So Ricky, what is known, right, is the fact of steel and aluminum, and we know that that has not really had an impact on any of us. When it comes to the specific componentry, I think that we are evaluating some of those things. But again, we have the robust supply chain. What we are seeing from the administration are still positive signs. I know there is a lot of rhetoric around the relationship between Canada, the U.S. and Mexico. We produce roughly 80% of what we sell. 20% we import, probably a little more than half of that. So that would be subject potentially to some opportunities of price increases. But we believe that our competition for those types of products, are doing exactly the same. So the marketplace would be impacted almost equally.","I would be encouraged by our supply chain in North America, to fully leverage our capabilities, should there be some differences that occur in how they interpret what components are. Yes, we purchase LED chips, but we purchase them from around the globe, not just, if you will, Chinese based suppliers. So we have other suppliers that we are -- that we consider partners, that are in different parts of the globe, than what is being discussed as potential targets for import duties.","Rick Kwas","Thank you. I am passing on.","Operator","Our next question comes from Ryan Merkel, William Blair. Your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","Thanks. So first question I had was on launching the value lines to win back share and the stock and flow. On average, how much lower are the ASPs relative to the product you are selling before? And then, are the gross margin rates similar or lower than before?","Vern Nagel","Yeah. So the opportunity of relaunching Contractor Select. I mean, the portfolio is roughly in place, and some of those products are being sold today. So we don't see, a meaningful if you will, change in price. But what we do see, is on the products that we are adding, what we are doing is, those products are more appropriately featured. Though there will be some points of differentiation, that will make them more appropriately featured for the market, and our cost structure will be more attractive for us. So really, it has more to do with us, not if you will, gaining share. We are not losing share. Yeah, we could gain share. We expect to continue to grow in those areas. But it's really about attacking some of our profitability around those, and to improve that price mix, if you will, relationship.","Ryan Merkel","So, the gross margin has been similar to before?","Vern Nagel","Gross margin, I am going to talk gross margin percentage. I think, that our gross margin percentages will continue to improve on that, if you will revamp product line. From a pricing perspective, we don't believe we have been losing any share in the marketplace. We think that there is actually opportunity to gain share. Data around that is hard to come by, but the data that we do have, suggests that we are maintaining our share, even in the face of, if you will, some price degradation and substitutions going on that end. We just want to improve our profitability margin percentages on those products that we sell. We are seeing nice volume growth, form factors are changing, and so we expect that. We are actually driving some of that. So while the top line dollars are being impacted in that substitution, we think that we are actually improving our margin percentages. So it'd be interesting to see.","The installed base is massive, and that's where a lot of this stuff is going. So we believe, there could be an incremental opportunity for sales growth, even though units will be up higher than sales dollars. But we want to continue to drive our sales dollars up as well, as well as our margin percentage with these types of more competitive value propositions for that portion of the market.","Ryan Merkel","Got it. That's helpful. Okay, and then secondly, why have you needed to substitute to lower priced products or large commercial jobs?","Vern Nagel","I am sorry, say that again?","Ryan Merkel","You mentioned you needed to substitute to lower priced products for large commercial projects? I am wondering, what was the driver there, what's driving that decision?","Vern Nagel","Yeah, if I said that, I didn't mean that. So I apologize. I think that on the larger projects, the opportunity there is to sell value propositions that, where price -- price is always important. It's a competitive bid business. But it's not the same as, if you will, stock and flow, where there is not really a specifier involved. Our pricing and our opportunities in that, on those larger projects, is really brought to bear by [ph] -- we are having a much better mix of products typically, we are adding much more controls into it. And we are having the product or a project manage those capabilities with our channel partners, to bring value to that entire project. So I don't consider that to be a -- it's very different than what's happening, if you will, in that lesser featured individual single product flowing to non-specified jobs. So if I said that, somehow we are having to substitute product on larger projects, that's not what I meant. Ricky?","Ryan Merkel","Got it, I think I -- got it Ricky.","Ricky Reece","I was just going to say, the substitution, we are seeing that as in moving from troughers to panels or some downlights to wafers, not in the major projects as mentioned.","Ryan Merkel","Got it. I just misunderstood I think the press release, I read it wrong. Lastly, the price pressure you are seeing, is it still just impacting the 20% of sales that you have defined as less for future products?","Vern Nagel","Yeah again, as we have said, project business by its very nature, has always been a bid business. But typically, folks, when they are bidding, they are looking at the full value of their solution set. It's not just products, it's how well can they project manage it. How well can they tie in their more sophisticated control solutions, things of that nature. So again, while it's a competitive bid business, it's not someone coming in and saying, I sent something over the internet, and here is my price, do you want to buy it? It's very different than that.","And on the 80-20, I would say, the 20% is more people who are interested in first cost. Price and availability more important than features and functionality, for people who are interested in the total cost of ownership, they do have an ear towards, how will this help me make my building smarter and more intelligent. How will it make my building do more things for me. So you have the opportunity to differentiate your value proposition. Sure, there is still substitution going on, as Ricky points out, for some of these products, just because, some of these new form factors are really cool and really interesting. Some of them are at lower price points and the brethren that they are potentially displacing, but then there are other products that are coming to the marketplace, that are higher priced than the products that they are displacing, because they do there, and they are better luminaires.","Ryan Merkel","Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sophie Karp with Guggenheim Securities. Your line is open.","Sophie Karp","Hi. Good morning guys. Thank you for taking my question. I wanted to drill down a little more on the lack of large big jobs that you have been referencing. This is actually quite kind of interesting, because we don't see the same dynamic in other dynamics that are levered to the same construction cycles, and for example, we cover some HVAC names, and they have seen an increase in large jobs in the last quarter or two. So I am curious, if maybe -- are you seeing that, maybe the agents are being disintermediated somehow, because I am assuming if the building is being built, that means HVACs also needs light anyway. So why is that, that there is such discrepancy in this trend, around similarly the same markets? Maybe can you comment on that.","Vern Nagel","That's a nice question. Yes I can. It is very encouraging to us that the HVAC and other folks like that are seeing pickups in their business, because the last people into larger projects are the lighting people, the furniture people, the carpet people. So we are the last 20% of any project. So this is why I said in my prepared remarks, and why we feel that, there is going to be this uptick, because we are seeing improvement in the steel people, in the HVAC people, in some of these things.","But I would tell you that, we are not forecasters, so I want to be really clear about that. We use data that you all see. If I look at the census bureau, private non-residential spend, which is a key market for us, it has been down low single digits or flat for nine months in a row. That's not our data, that's census data. Private resi, has been -- it went from being kind of low double digit, now it's kind of flat -- excuse me, down middle single digit. And then when we look at lighting equipment, also from a U.S. census bureau, it has been down five of the last six quarters, and in the most quarter, it was down 3.5%.","So I don't think that the channel is being disintermediated, particularly for larger projects, the channel may be under or channels, I should say, may be under pressure for different ways of conducting business over the internet, things of that nature, on those low end lesser feature type products. But I think on the larger project side, I think we're positioned incredibly well for that uptick. So I would submit to you that the positiveness that you are seeing in some other folks who are earlier in the construction cycle, should bode well for the overall lighting industry for larger projects.","Sophie Karp","Got it. Thank you. I will jump back in the queue.","Operator","Our next question comes from Tim Wojs with Baird. Your line is open.","Tim Wojs","Hey, good morning everybody. Maybe just -- I just had a couple of cost questions; so I guess on the SD&A line, I think absolute SG&A might have been up about $20 million year-on-year in the second quarter, and I know it's a weaker quarter from a percentage basis. But on an absolute basis in the back half of the year, would you expect SD&A to continue to be up in dollar values? And I guess, what's the flexibility that you have internally to take cost actions to maybe reduce that SD&A line if you have to?","Vern Nagel","We would expect dollars to be higher in the back half, and understand why. So a portion of our SDA is truly variable, freight and commissions. It's roughly between 11.5%, 12% of sales, and so as sales in the back half of those, everyone knows, we are more of the back half oriented company. Third quarter, fourth quarter sales are typically higher than first and second quarter, with second quarter typically being our lowest sales quarter. So that variable dollar is going to take it up.","Number two, the headcount; while it has been fairly stable for the last few quarters, on a period-over-period basis, it's still going to increase.","Wage inflation is alive and well. We provided the merit increases effective November 1st Ricky, I think it was? And so, the range there. So we have added wage increases headcount to a degree, we are enhancing the incentive compensation based on full year opportunity. Cash flow has been very robust, which is one of our elements, and we have been incurring some additional costs, because we are expanding access into a couple of different channels, that are requiring incremental investment. The third quarter is typically always higher, because we have light fair, and we have our national sales meeting, which are millions of dollars to pull these things off, those are period expenses. But yet, we expect our revenues to increase even in this, if you will, somewhat tepid environment. So as a percentage of sales, we would expect our adjusted SDA to come back down.","It's interesting, when I look back over the last handful of years, we have had SDA in the second quarter of 27.8% before. I mean, I am not saying that it's a good or bad thing, but these are investments.","Now in answer to your question around taking costs out, we are always looking for ways to improve our structure, our cost structure. I am very pleased with what our supply chain people are doing. We have seen real productivity gains. If you all go back to the fourth quarter of 2016, where we had some issues related to the stability of the workforce in a couple of places, because of dynamics that were happening beyond our control. We have now really found stability there.","So we are looking at areas where can we stop doing some things, so that we can continue to invest in areas that have long term promise. This has been one of the most challenging environments, that I this management team has had to deal with, because the markets in theory, if you look at the stock market, if you look at the overall economy, you see things that are positive. But yet, when you look at the real underlying factors relative to non-residential construction in our world, it's almost as if we are in a bit of a recession. And yet, we see tremendous attractive long term opportunities to takeaway, as we think about, what Atrius can mean.","So we are managing the heck out of it, making tough decisions about what we are not going to do, so we can invest in things that we are going to do. The things that we are going to do take a little bit longer to come to fruition. But if I look at Atrius, and our Atrius enabled luminaires and our building management platform, these businesses continue to add to our top line growth. So we are excited about the prospects of the previous question. If HVAC is now picking up, that should have a positive contagion to Acuity on a go forward basis.","Tim Wojs","Okay. Great. That's very helpful. I appreciate all the color. And then, I guess relative to pricing and maybe managing some of the commodity increases that you might be seeing in raw materials and freight, would you -- are you comfortable getting like-for-like pricing increases, just given maybe some of the competitiveness in the market? Or do you -- would that come through new product introductions, that might have a higher ASP or a despec product? Thanks.","Vern Nagel","Yeah, we are looking to -- we have increased prices on certain fixtures and solution sets that are directly impacted by some of these increases in raw material costs. But we are also looking to continue to drive costs out through new product designs, that allow us to maintain the margin percentages, and even grow the margin percentages, off of those products, as new form factors come into the marketplace. So I think it's a combination of both. And Ricky, we are also looking at just our overall, if you will, total business structure. Can we do things in our business and be more efficient, and that's part of what our ABS process is, how do we continue to use Kaizen events to take costs out of our business, so that we can reinvest it in other areas. Ricky?","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Everyone, thanks for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies, and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas, to have the potential over the longer term to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. We believe strongly our future is bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","That concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating.

After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Hello, good morning. With me today to discuss our third quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer.","We are webcasting today's conference call at acuitybrands.com. I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will be happy to answer your questions.","First off, our results for the third quarter of 2016 were outstanding. Our net sales grew 25% while our adjusted diluted earnings per share grew 40%. We achieved record quarterly results for a number of key financial metrics including net sales and gross profit margin and on an adjusted basis operating profit and diluted earnings per share. In fact this was our 13th quarter in a row where we achieved double digit volume growth, a remarkable achievement.","We believe these results are yet again strong evidence of our strategies to provide our customers with differentiated value-added solutions and to diversify the end-markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position. These strategies include accretive acquisitions, the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting and building automation solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity gains.","Our results for the third quarter set records for Acuity even as we continue to invest in our strong sales growth in the areas with significant growth potential including the expansion of our solid state luminaire and lighting controls portfolio, as well as our building automation and Internet-of-Things solution. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more details later in the call but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.","Net sales for the third quarter were $852 million, an increase of 25% compared with a year ago period, and the highest quarterly sales in our history. Reported operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 was $121 million compared with reported operating profit of $99.2 million in the year ago period. There were adjustments in both quarters for a certain special charges which Ricky will describe later in the call.","Also our reported operating profit included items such as share based compensation expense, costs associated with the acquisition, and certain purchase accounting adjustments including profit in inventory and amortization expense for acquired intangible.","In order to make our quarter results comparable between periods we find it helpful to add back these items to our reported results. In doing so one can see adjusted operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 with a quarterly record of $146.1 million compared with an adjusted operating profit of $108.1 million in the year ago period, an increase of 35%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 17.2% up 140 basis points from the adjusted margins in the year ago period.","Adjusted diluted earnings per share was a quarterly record of $2.06 compared with adjusted diluted EPS of $1.47 in the year ago period up 40%. This is compelling performance. We closed the quarter with $337 million of cash on hand after investing $614 million for acquisitions this year leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies. Further we generated a record of $244 million from net cash provided by operations in the first three quarters of 2016 up $86 million or 54% from the year ago period.","Our record results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year ago period. We believe you will find our results for the quarter even more impressive upon further analysis. Net sales for the third quarter grew 25% compared with the year ago period. We estimate our sales volume grew by an impressive 16%. The additions of Distech and Juno increased net sales another 12 points while changes in price mix and foreign currency reduced net sales by approximately 2 points and 1 point respectively.","While it is not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on like kind LED luminaires between periods reflecting the decline in certain component cost and to a lesser degree changes in the mix of products sold.","The increase in net sales was broad based along most product lines and sales channels. Sales of LED products at Acuity now account for approximately 60% of our total net sales, which as you know, includes the sale of non-fixture related products and solutions as well.","Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative and holistic lighting and building automation solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments for the quarter. As we noted earlier, our adjusted third quarter operating profit was $146.1 million, the most in our history and adjusted operating profit margin for the quarter was a quarterly record of 17.2% up 140 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year ago period.","Further, our adjusted gross profit margin for the quarter was a record 44.5% up 130 basis points compared with the year ago period. The expansion of our adjusted gross profit margin was primarily due to the benefits of higher net sales volume, productivity improvements throughout the supply chain and lower input costs, partially offset by the addition of Juno which in its recent past has had a lower gross profit margin than Acuity.","Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses excluding the adjustments \u2013 the adjustment items noted earlier for each quarter were up $45.2 million or 24%. Adjusted SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.3% in the current quarter, a decrease of 10 basis points from the year-ago period. The increase in adjusted SD&A expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the impact of acquisitions and to a lesser degree higher compensation costs. The increase in compensation costs was primarily due to additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solutions strategy.","Next point is very important. Another way to view just how robust our third quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin excluding the impact of acquisition. On a comparable basis our variable contribution margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately 30%, well above our current target of mid to upper 20s. All-in-all, we had another great quarter.","On the strategic front, we continue to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting-controls as well as our building automation platform.","With the addition of Juno we now offer customers more than 1.8 million lighting SKUs to choose from, more than three times as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our Digital Lighting Solutions portfolio, including controls and now building automation systems and IoT applications.","The innovation continues to be at the forefront of our strategy. For example our Innovative LED Solutions earned multiple awards from the industry\u2019s most prestigious programs during LIGHTFAIR International including the 2016 LFI Innovation Awards and the Next Generation Luminaires Solid-State Lighting Design Indoor Competition. Additionally we continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated, tiered solutions strategy which consists of four tiers.","The purpose of this strategy is to lever our incredibly diverse and growing portfolio by offering customers solutions that best meet their needs, whether it would be a single device which we categorize as Tier 1 or a complete holistic integrated lighting and building automation solutions, which we refer to as Tier 3 for the indoor and outdoor needs, and everything in between.","We deliver this comprehensive portfolio all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple, both to install and to use. These are compelling and powerful value propositions for our customers and a competitive advantage for Acuity. And the additions of Distech, Geometri and Juno has meaningfully enhanced our industry leading capabilities and solutions portfolio. ","While sales stated for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe sales of our Tier 3 category, encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up approximately 40% through the first three quarters of this year over the year-ago period and now represent almost 10% of our total sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support our connectivity to the Internet of Things, affording Acuity additional revenue streams which we identify as Tier 4 solution.","To fully execute our holistic tiered solution strategy, we have continued to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers\u2019 applications. We have added enormous capabilities over the last year including our recent acquisitions as well as increased salary headcount to support the growth as part of this overall tiered solutions strategy. ","Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment, while realizing additional benefits including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet of Things. Because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize the unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application, and with the addition of Distech Controls we believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.","At Acuity, we are not just talking Internet of Things, we are doing it. Over the last 12 months we have converted over 12 million square feet of space for customers, including Target and two other global leading retailers to Smart Lighting Solution. As part of the Smart Lighting Solution, we currently have almost 200,000 maintenance free Beacon enabled LED lighting fixtures that are performing superbly collecting data and enabling applications to provide users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful actionable information.","We believe this level of capability and deployment is unmatched in our industry. Importantly, we expect this installed base to quadruple by the end of 2016. Further target selected Acuity as its exclusive Smart Lighting Solutions provider. The integration of Distech which operates into its historical markets as more of a standalone company is moving along very well.","We expect the combination of Acuity with its broad industry leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solution and Distech to contribute to our tiered solutions strategy are offering holistic unified solutions that deliver true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building. ","These solutions are designed to enhance the occupant experience, improve the quality of the visual environment and provide seamless operational energy efficiency and cost reductions as well as increase digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data that can better enable the Internet of Things for building owners. ","In fact we just introduced [nLight Eclipse] [ph] a powerful cost effective capability that enhances our industry leading lighting controls by making them far simpler to deploy and more impactful at delivering total Smart Building Solution that unifies lighting HVAC, power metering and security. This solution set streamlines building programming, facilitates our smart multi-zone daylight harvesting and color turning capabilities and enhances IoT access.","We believe the capabilities and ease of installation of this Tier 3 solution set is unmatched in the industry today. Through the deployment of solutions like these as part of our tiered solutions strategy Acuity Brands is driving the evolution to smart buildings in smart cities. We expect these recent strategic acquisitions coupled with our aggressive internal investments will allow us to continue diversify and strengthen our foundation as we further serve as a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new non-residential construction cycle. ","We have been able to produce these results because we - of the dedication and resolve of our now 10,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2016. Ricky?","Richard Reece","Thank you, Vern and good morning everyone. As Vern noted we had a strong third quarter performance on virtually all metrics including sales and earnings growth, profitability and cash flow. I will provide a bit more color on our record third quarter results and our financial position. As Vern mentioned earlier we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the third quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2015 which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be comparable. ","In the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 we added back $1 million or $0.02 per diluted share for various acquisition related items. $7.5 million or $0.11 per diluted share for the amortization of acquired intangible assets. $6.9 million or $0.10 per diluted share for share based compensation expense and $9.7 million or $0.14 per diluted share for special charges related to streamlining activities including integration of recent acquisitions and consolidation of certain production activities. ","We adjusted prior year results for amortizations for acquired intangible assets of $2.8 million of $0.04 per diluted share, share based compensation expense of $4.4 million or $0.06 per diluted share acquisition related items of $1.3 million or $0.03 per diluted share and special charge of $0.4 million or $0.01 per diluted share. ","In addition we adjusted prior year\u2019s results for the gain on financial instruments used to hedged the deistic Canadian dollar purchase price of $10.5 million or $0.15 per diluted share. These adjustments to our GAAP earnings resulted in an adjusted diluted EPS of $2.06 for the third quarter of fiscal year 2016 which is a 40% increase compared with the $1.47 adjusted diluted EPS in the year ago period. ","We believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhanced visibility into our results of operations. We thank you for find this transparency very helpful in your analysis for our performance. In addition many of our \u2013companies make the same adjustments that would help you as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry. ","In our earnings release and Form-10Q we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. During the third quarter of fiscal 2016, the company recorded a pre-tax special charge of $9.7 million were actions initiated to streamline the organization including the integration of recent acquisitions.","These streamlining activities include the consolidations of selected production activities and realignment of certain responsibilities primarily within various selling, distribution and administrative departments. We expect to achieve net annual savings of at least twice the amount of the special charge commencing at the end of the first quarter of fiscal year 2017. ","We anticipate incurring additional cost associated with these and potential future integration and streamlining activities in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016. The effective tax rate for the third quarter was 34.3% compared with 36% in the third quarter of last year. We expect the effective tax rate for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5%. ","Before any discreet items and in if the rates in our tax and jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year. Cash flow generators from operations for the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 were an impressive $243.9 million and increase of $85.7 million or 54% compared with the prior year. ","We did an excellent job this quarter of managing operating working capital defines as receivables plus inventories less payables. As our operating working capital net of the effect of acquisitions decreased by one day compared with last year as 41 days which we believe is industry leading. ","In the first nine months of fiscal year 2016 we spent $61.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $42.3 million in the prior year. This uptake in capital expenditures is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth including tooling for new products, expansion and our electronic capacity and building out of our innovation and technology center in Metro, Atlanta which we moved into earlier this fiscal year. ","We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016. At May 31, 2016 we had cash and cash equivalent balance of $337 million. A decrease of $419.8 million since August 31, 2015, this decrease was primarily to cash used to fund acquisitions of $613.7 million in capital expenditures to $61.8 million as well as to pay dividends to shareholders of $17.1 million. ","Our total debt outstanding was $354.4 million at May 31, 2016. The ratio of debt net of cash to total capitalization net of cash was 1.1% at May 31, 2016. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at May 31, 2016 under our credit facility which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy significant financial strength and flexibility and will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you. And I will now turn the call back to Vern.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Last week\u2019s UK referendum with European Union has created a great deal of uncertainty and generated significant volatility in the global financial markets over concerns regarding the potential impact if any on the global economy.","This uncertainty and volatility have the potential to affect consumer and business sentiment which could negatively impact global economic activity. This notwithstanding we remain bullish regarding the company\u2019s prospects for continued profitable growth.","So while we don\u2019t give earnings guidance, I would like to provide a few observations. First the consensus estimate from independent third-party forecasters calls for the broad lighting market in North America which represents 97% of our total net sales to grow to mid to upper single digit range through fiscal 2016 reflecting the benefits of both new construction and renovation activity. Again the favorable trend in our June order rate seems to support this continued levels of improvement, further we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. ","Leading indicators for the North American markets such as architecture billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces, while residential construction continues to grow nicely.","Excluding the price of certain LED components which are expected to continue to decline and steel costs, which have risen recently, we do not anticipate significant changes in most input costs over the next 12 months. We expect to offset the impact of rising steel prices through certain pricing initiatives and product cost reductions further we expect employee related cost to continue to rise primarily due to increases in associate headcount, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising healthcare cost.","Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations particularly during this period of uncertainty caused by the U.K. announcement last week. Another observation, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, innovation, price product and sales channel mix as well as current dilutive impact of Juno, we expect our annual gross profit margin to continue to improve over time as volumes grow and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies including cost savings related to the integration of recent acquisition.","Our record adjusted gross profit margin for the first nine months of fiscal 2016 is a good example of our potential, it is a positive picture. Additionally, while we always experience some isolated pricing pressures in various markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors, should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly and most importantly, we expect our growth rates to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we\u2019re very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting and building automation solutions that for example connect smart lighting with smart phones for retailers, as well as our growing electronic component software capabilities.","We are experiencing strong interest from many of our key customers for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more. And as I noted earlier, we expect to quadruple our installed base by the end of 2016.","As we have noted in last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tier solution strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is really a continuation in the advancement of our overall growth strategy, which has been in place for some time. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market and add much greater opportunities to offer our customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities.","While we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in our growth rates for Tier 3, and the implementation of our IoT solutions. Further, we expect the addition of Juno to meaningfully expand and strengthen our lighting solutions portfolio, including both down and track lighting as well as enhance our presence in the residential and corporate account sales channels.","As we noted in our last earnings call, while we are extremely bullish on the long-term growth potential of the Juno Lighting Group, we experienced some modest short-term impact on their net sales, as we integrated certain overlapping sales forces. We are pleased to report the integration of those sales forces has been substantially completed and early indicators such as quote rates for Juno products are up significantly over the year ago period. This gives us optimism that much of the negative impact of the sales force integration is behind us.","Lastly, the addition of Geometri, a small yet fast growing business intelligence company, will enhance our expanding business analytics capabilities as part of our software solutions portfolio to support retailers and other building users need for actionable data. The addition of Geometri will meaningfully enhance our Tier 4 solutions offering and is already paying dividends through greater customer connectivity.","Our company-wide strategy is straight forward, expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns.","This all takes focus and resources. We're investing to enhance and expand our core competencies to excel in our fast changing industry because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market; our record growth supports this view.","As I\u2019ve said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building automation systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of continued opportunities for new construction and more importantly the conversion of the installed base which is enormous in size to more efficient solutions particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet-of-Things.","We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building automation industries, some of which could grow by 50% over the next few years will provide us with significant growth potential. As a North American market leader in lighting solutions and a technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] The first question is from John Walsh with Vertical Research.","John Walsh","Hi, good morning. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the acquisition pipeline and then kind of wondering also about some of the volatility we are seeing in Europe, if that kind of opens an opportunity to do something there or if you feel you need to wait for the market to normalize a bit before you would do anything in that market?","Vernon Nagel","So Ricky why don't I take the second part first and then you comment on acquisition. Our strategy in broad Europe is really two-fold. We have a very strong brand in both industrial and Roadway, as well as other types of indoor capabilities.","So we will continue to drive our productivity, our focus in those markets with those products. We focus on U.K., we focus on Germany, Northern Europe. We have our capability in Spain and my senses is that, while there is great deal of uncertainty going on right on, which could have some impact on our order rate, we still think it\u2019s a bullish opportunity because of what certain markets and certain countries are doing in terms of their industrial output.","So while Europe represents or sales outside of North America represent really only 3% of our total we continue to like the strategy that we have in Europe and that is to focus on key customer sets, key channels with key products that we have and maintain our capability there.","If there are opportunities that come up we\u2019ll look at them but they have to be very consistent with our strategy. In terms of acquisitions overall, we continue to see a very interesting pipeline and Ricky why don't I ask you to comment on that.","Richard Reece","Yes, we continue as Vern said to see a very robust opportunity for acquisitions. Our focus is in two primary areas technology and there we continue to see opportunities not only to acquire but to make investments in minority or larger investments in or to partner or lastly to just have a commercial relationship to share technology on a licensing type arrangements. So we do see a lot of opportunities there and continue to be very active in pursuing opportunities to expand our capability and technology.","The other areas in bolt-on tuck-in type acquisitions both for our luminaire business as well as our Control Building Management business. There too we\u2019re seeing a robust pipeline obviously Juno is a great example of bolt-on, tuck-in type acquisition that fills gaps that we have. There we are more likely obviously look to acquire as opposed to invest in but we do see a robust pipeline and I think it\u2019s likely in both of those areas to continue to see SP active where it supports our strategic focus and creates a value at a reasonable price.","Vernon Nagel","And as everyone knows, we are very disciplined in terms of the acquisitions that we make. Transactions have to be both desirable as well as doable from a financial perspective. So it\u2019s difficult to precisely determine the exact timing of acquisitions. But suffice it to say that it\u2019s part of our strategy for growth. We will continue to look for these types of opportunities as Ricky described.","John Walsh","Okay. And then just on the second question, are there any metric that you can share about driving the Tier 3, Tier 4 solutions growth either the amount of headcount that has been added to sales and engineering this year and kind of expectations in the next year, how you\u2019re going to drive that initiative?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. In my prepared remarks I said that Tier 3 solutions through the first three months and again it\u2019s coming off of a smaller base and our measuring capabilities in the prior periods weren\u2019t as robust as they are today but we guesstimate that Tier 3 portion of our business which now represents almost 10% of our business grew at approximately 40% growth rate.","When we think about how we have invested in our tiered solutions strategy in our headcount including acquisitions this year is probably up and their salaried headcount area close to 30%. And while we don\u2019t specifically allocate all capabilities by tiers because of the way products can work and migrate through the tiers and support the tiers it\u2019s not really an effective use to allocate.","But what I can say is that when we look at things specific to our tiered solutions strategy like our ability to develop software whether it\u2019d be firmware that makes our entire Tier 3 solutions work well between various control components Distech of course and in our lighting business that group has expanded by a factor of four.","We probably had 18 months ago less than 20 folks in this group today we have over while we are approaching 80 folks. And by the end of the year we will probably have close to 100 on our way probably to 150 people. And it\u2019s really because of the opportunities that we see in supporting the Tier 3, Tier 4 solution set.","We are very pleased to announce that Target selected us as their exclusive Smart Lighting Solutions provider. The opportunity to provide them not only with lighting solutions that enhance energy efficiency but provide them with other opportunities to do things is really \u2013 I think it\u2019s the ample of how we\u2019re moving but investing in and growing our Tier 3 solution strategy.","So more to come there into very early innings of this game and we are very excited about the potential of what this tiered solutions strategy will afford for U.S. shareholders and for our customers as solutions.","John Walsh","Great, thank you for the color. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Tim Weiss with Baird.","Tim Weiss","Hi guys, good morning, nice job. I guess just going back to Target, is there any way to maybe kind of put some numbers around just the revenue opportunity? I think you said that the number of beacon enabled light fixtures is going to quadruple by the end of the year and just maybe some rough math, that could add a couple of points to revenue growth. So just want to make sure that maybe I'm in the ballpark in terms of how we should think about the Target win financially?","Vernon Nagel","Well, I mean as you might imagine the opportunity of Target, the initial opportunity is somewhat I mean interesting in that they will build out, I think the number is probably north of 300 stores over the next three or four months.","I think what's more interesting in trying to put a numerical number around it, and it's not just target, it's the whole notion of how the installed base not just in retail, but when you think about other very large building owners whether it's campuses or universities or research centers, these large installed base is the opportunity to convert them from traditional lighting to smart lighting solutions really is not only for energy savings, but daylight harvesting, the ability to make the visual space better more effective, the opportunity to participate in the Internet of Things as data collection points that's what we find really fascinating.","So, our relationship with Target is a decades or long relationship. There are great customer and we dedicate significant resources to making sure that we are meeting their needs at every step. So it's an example of our access to market and then bringing these solutions that to the market that are allowing us to drive two or three.","So when I think about the total market, DOE says that there's 100 billion square feet of building space that is in U.S. 70% of which was put in place before 1990. Few years ago, we estimated that to convert that installed base might have been about $3 a square foot for lighting and controls.","Today we believe that number is much higher, because of the true value add that can be brought through the smart life and the target situation is just an example. And there are many, many, many more.","So without focusing too much on target but focusing more on what target represents as a leader in the retail space and taking a leadership position to make the conversion to smart lighting. I think that's what's really interesting. And then how that expands and extends to other folks that are different subsets of the retail market, which as you know is huge, so that they can take advantage of smart lighting. That's the potential. I think that the market that\u2019s out there that installed base is enormous in size and represents an enormous opportunity for Acuity as we go forward. ","Tim Weiss","That is great. Would you say that over the last maybe even year to date that the number of conversations that you are having with retailers is starting to accelerate?","Vernon Nagel","Absolutely, and it's not just retailers, it's users of space that are looking to optimize how they use based, not just from an energy saving standpoint, but how can quality of life enhance what they're doing. How can these luminaries that can be enabled in a much more effective way.","Today and you still have technologies that are out there that are using battery powered beacons and somehow they're trying to say that that is the equivalent. It's really a shame because those that that old technology those old solutions that people are saying well I have that too. It's really not the same. And as people become more comfortable and I understand the solutions that what Acuity offers is really huge, the introduction of nLight Eclipse for example. ","But just another example of a Tier 3 solutions that allows us to get after building owners not just retailers but all building owners in a way that allows us to optimize their lighting while driving great unification between the HVAC systems, sub-metering, security and lighting and allowing us to do this in a very, very clever and simple way. It doesn\u2019t exist in the marketplace so we\u2019re excited about that whole approach to the installed base because of its size and scale.","Tim Weiss","Okay. And then just my second question, just on the restructuring and the streamlining expenses that you called out, should we think of that as incremental to the mid to high 20% incremental margin target that you have out there or is it kind of included in that target over the next year?","Vernon Nagel","The opportunities that we have to continue to direct investment in our business we're looking for ways to continue to own how we approach the market. The investments that we make and some of those are difficult decisions of what we are not going to because they are still some market but we see so much potential and again Tier 3 and Tier 4 it what can mean for that install base.","We will continue to direct investment and continue to drive productivity in our business and I\u2019ll consider this productivity opportunity where we can continue to invest. This quarter we delivered on the legacy business about 30% variable contribution. So its higher than what we kind of have been targeting into that mid to upper 20s, so, we\u2019re always looking to optimize in the short term what we are doing in terms of variable contribution margin so, we can drive our results but we are doing that against the back drop of long term investment opportunities.","And for us mostly that's human capital. We\u2019re spending right now on CapEx about 2.5% of sales little bit higher than what we normally do but we're still investing at a very rapid pace in our human talent as I mentioned earlier in putting acquisitions or salary headcounts up about 30% but interestingly our SD&A as a percentage of total sales we picked up about 10 bips. So we\u2019re looking to leverage our base while investing, so to say precisely that all of those savings are going to enhance variable contribution we're looking at balancing of investing for the short term as well as driving - investing for the longer term while investing our delivery shorter term as well","Tim Weiss","Great, keep up the good work and good luck.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Sven Eenmaa with Stifel.","Sven Eenmaa","Thanks for taking my questions. First I wanted to ask in terms of your sales in today new construction and renovation market. What kind of growth rates are you seeing in new construction versus renovation side and are there any verticals in the market which you see accelerating or decelerating currently?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. Overall we believe that our mix of business is tilted - we have estimated 50% renovation, 50% new construction, it\u2019s probably tilting a little bit more towards renovation and I would see that over time, it may even tilt more because the installed base is so enormous and the opportunity there is to provide value solution sets and customers where there is no alternative, they\u2019re not building something they\u2019re not renovating, we call that unplanned renovation but it\u2019s because the payback and the opportunity of the new solution set is so compelling that they want to make that unplanned renovation.","I would say new construction continues to move along at a solid but yet somewhat of almost schizophrenic pace. We see spurts and then we see declines, we see spurts and declines and that has to do with the entire geography because we served so many different markets, it\u2019s difficult to discern an absolute trend. There is no doubt that when we went through here over the last 18 months changes in oil prices that's some of the activities and those oil patch areas slowed down a little bit but yet in other areas of technology, we see those markets continuing to expand.","So I feel generally speaking that as employment continues to improve, we\u2019re seeing broad based improvement in commercial office buildings, we're seeing improvements in healthcare as budgets of states continue to improve, we are seeing spending on education both K through 12 as well as higher education, the industrial segment continues to move along nicely, roadway seems to be moving along quite nicely.","So I think all in all, we are continuing to see improvement on a gradual basis but it\u2019s the - it\u2019s the renovation market that allows us to continue to drive our growth in a solid way.","Europe, we will wait and see what happens there. Obviously that uncertainty is out there but I don\u2019t feel like that contagion of anything that may go on there will spill over here. And just to reiterate, 97% of our revenues are generated here. We have a great business in the U.K. and in Spain. Obviously U.K.'s products just got a heck of a lot cheaper for people to now acquire them and mainly in Europe. So we continue to be bullish on the overall opportunities for Acuity.","Sven Eenmaa","Great to hear. The second question I wanted to ask was regarding your integrated solution which now you can provide both the Distech acquisition including lighting controls and HVAC and obviously you mentioned security as well. There are obviously already established competitors in those markets but curious to understand like which verticals or which market segments do you see for US, kind of the lowest hanging fruit or where do you expect to make the fastest headway there?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. So if you look at Distech, and Distech is a technology control company and so it\u2019s not really selling hardware components. So when you move or remove that and you look at people who are selling software control solutions Distech has while it\u2019s a smaller business it has a very strong reputation for being innovative using technology and it has a reasonable market share.","And so the opportunity for us to work with and have two channels, there are traditional channel system integrators and our traditional channel of local agents work together to sell these solution set that really provide a great deal of value for really buildings of all types. And really explain why using our now Unified system which we\u2019re very excited about. It\u2019s software it took a lot of time to develop a lot of hard work but the nLight Eclipse System will be the backbone in terms of creating a very, very simple piece of glass for building users to now manage the affairs of their building in a much more simple and effective way.","So we\u2019re very excited about the possibilities and the opportunities of that because it\u2019s applicability again think of education campuses of any type, commercial office buildings, healthcare facilities and you can just keep going on buildings of any type are really the opportunity here.","And given the connectivity that we have through contractors, engineers, lighting designers and they through system integrators and then their own form of contractors this will allow us to sell those value proposition. And the ease of installation, the ease of programming is really going to be a point of key differentiation and then the end user has again very, very simple tools or simple to use but massive tools that are available to help drive the effectiveness of their building.","Sven Eenmaa","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. And the next question is from Jeff Osborne with Cowen & Company.","Jeff Osborne","Hi, good morning and congratulations on the results. I just had two quick questions. One, on the 2% price mix; that is a little higher than recent quarters. You had alluded to on the call that the driver of that was the LED component and other component price declines, but I just wanted to get a sense of was there a pickup there or was your reductions in price somewhat of a catch-up or where there competitive aspects at play? Any color would be helpful.","Richard Reece","Yes, I would say it\u2019s a slight pick-up we\u2019ve been saying 1% so it\u2019s a slight pick-up with around \u2013 we have seen kind of a trough in not just LED components which is the primary driver of that but still in other areas that kind of hit a trough and there\u2019s a little bit of lag and when that gets in pricing that I think impacted that. It\u2019s those kinds of cost reductions in commodity such as steel, aluminum. Copper do get past on pretty quickly in our industry.","Now as many of you know steel has taken a quick V turn not even a U turn, the V turn based on the tariffs that have been imposed on steel to where we\u2019ve seen steel rise 35 something percent here in the last few months.","So I - it will be interesting to see how quick the market reacts to passing that on. Historically they have been -- the industry has passed that on. But I would say it\u2019s still predominantly due to passing on reduction in our input cost predominantly LED but we have seen some reduction in others that it cause that number to round to 2% instead of the 1%.","Jeff Osborne","Got it. Thanks for that, Ricky. Then, Vern, for you. You mentioned target over the next three to four months roughly 300 stores. I think you also in your prepared remarks alluded to two other retailers, which I imagine you are limited in what you can -- at least naming them, but can you just give us a sense of scope? Is the timeframe for rollout a similar timeframe, as well as scope and size of the number of stores?","Vernon Nagel","Again we are working with multiple end customers and multiple different verticals and we don\u2019t have specific date. But my too sense is that based on the question that we had earlier the activity in the interest level is increasing at a very high rate. And our ability to position ourselves and to have dialogue with these various end customers is robust. And you know, retailers are very, very focused on the quality of lighting their store. They are very focused on energy savings. They are very focused on these types of things.","So the transition from conventional for us in lighting into LED while it\u2019s very interesting they are doing it because they see multiple opportunities around it. I mentioned target only by way of example and when you think about the installed base and I want to keep bringing this back to that. It is so be enormous in terms of the potential for conversion that this was where our excitement is. It\u2019s not - for the investing public you guys the several give us some evidence that the Tier 3 solutions that their strategy can work.","Our growth there is being quite significant as a percentage of our sales. It\u2019s now becoming significant. This was a customer that made a move. It\u2019s just a \u2013 it\u2019s a continuation of the margin towards the huge opportunities that\u2019s out there. So you are right. I\u2019m not going to mention other names but I want to make sure investors understand is that the opportunity through all of these verticals is quite enormous.","And so we are looking at all those verticals and we\u2019re attacking them as we have with bigger and we are selling the solutions as we believe that we have great sales forces that know how to sell these types of solution set.","So it gives us a leg up in making sure that we\u2019re first. And I would expect us to continue to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve because of these types of opportunities. Again, the installed base is enormous and it\u2019s much larger could be a substantially larger than what new construction represents for a long time to come because of its size and its scale.","So that\u2019s why I\u2019d like to direct your attention and your focus. If you look at what our growth rates have been over the last 13 quarters double digit growth rates have outperformed the growth rates of the markets we serve. We are doing a good job bringing the margin to bear people they\u2019ve asked us about margins you have in Tier 3.","You know just a quick comment, if I look back over the last three years where we\u2019ve been implementing this tiered strategy approach, you know, we\u2019ve picked up close to 400 basis points on a gross profit margin and almost 500 basis points on our operating profit margin during that time period.","So while lots of things are happening to improve our business as we migrate and as we expand it\u2019s probably a better word in our Tier 3 solution strategy. You\u2019re seeing how it\u2019s influencing in a favorable way our margin impact. And while we\u2019re investing I mean this has been a continuous comment that we\u2019ve made. We are investing today because we see the opportunity of tomorrow. We started that a while back and you\u2019re seeing the return and the benefit off of that.","Our cash flow return on investments still is in the low 30 percentile which is you know puts us in the 95 percentile in terms of performance capabilities there. But I think we\u2019re doing all this right.","Jeff Osborne","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Brian Lee with Goldman Sachs.","Brian Lee","Hi, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. First one was on pricing, it does seem like ASP declines have been more moderate than a lot of people have been expecting particularly on the LED side given the component declines we have seen.","So just wondering does this have to do with your product mix simply getting better as part of the tiered strategy and masking the blended ASP declines or are there some other drivers behind this? And can you also comment on what the sustainability of the trend is medium and longer-term in your view?","Vernon Nagel","I think Acuity has done a very good job for a long time of really focusing on continuous improvement driving productivity gains throughout the business. We just simply because pricing of componentry comes down as Ricky pointed out earlier, it can find its way back into the market.","We deal on a bid world but we\u2019re all trying to or at least Acuity is trying to differentiate its features and benefits relative to the price and I think we have been successful in convincing our customers of the true value of the solution set that we bring.","Again when we are up against competitors that are bringing battery powered beacons to the marketplace that's old news, people who are installing that type of technology are making a huge mistake, it's almost irresponsible for them to do that. The fact of the matter is that Acuity continues to drive that productivity, drive the change in its value proposition so that it can continue to extract the value of our gross profit margin if you will for that value.","I expect that the trend to continue. We tend to look at gross profit over a annual period, not quarterly period, I know that you all have to look at everything on a quarterly basis but I think if you look at that type of thing over an annual basis, you\u2019ll see that continuous improvement in our business is allowing us to improve margins volume as that increases we\u2019re able to extract that variable contribution mix as we continue to grow Tier 3.","But let\u2019s be clear Tier 1 and Tier 2 are critically important and we do well there as well in terms of margin profile but there is no doubt that Tier 3 and Tier 4 have gross profit margin dynamics that are accretive to what we\u2019re doing today.","So we would expect to see that trend continue. Even the pricing as Ricky pointed out earlier on component cost, that's ebbing and flowing, it's something that we\u2019ve always had to manage. What\u2019s more important about it is you can continue to have improvements even incremental improvements in technology and that goes back into the florescent world. Just imagine when it went from T12 to T08 to T05 same scenario.","So simply because it\u2019s an LED light source, it hasn\u2019t really changed how we think about the internal workings of our business and how we compete in the marketplace, we are always trying to sell value, the new technology, LED is an enabler for us to selling more value, i.e. Internet of Things, combined solutions stats for energy savings, that's how we are driving the value and I expect the trend to continue.","Brian Lee","Great, that is super helpful. Second question was just on the market itself. Recently the DOE released some LED penetration statistics for the U.S. lighting market for 2015. If you look at the data it looks like resi has been slower than expected, both commercial and industrial has been tracking better and then outdoor was most penetrated at I think a bit over 20%.","So wondering how do those trends compare to what you are seeing in your business? And then on outdoor specifically, I know there has been a lot of talk about the retail channel and building automation but can you give us some sense of whether the higher penetration in that particular vertical is expected to lead to more moderate growth and then what your exposure is there specifically versus some of the other end market categories? Thank you.","Vernon Nagel","Sure. I can only comment on our outdoor business and that continues to grow at a very nice pace. So we are actually gaining share nicely there, our growth rates are exceeding the overall growth rates of the market. The reason for the penetration in outdoor it's a total cost of ownership type thing, the whole notion of whether it\u2019s an industrial outdoor or whether it\u2019s a street or roadway, these luminaires are very expensive to have to change light bulbs and maintain. So LED is a perfect opportunity to bring value there. ","So the penetration rate of outdoor makes complete sense to me and I expect that to continue but let me remind everyone, it\u2019s still only 20%, there is another 80% that is out there and that 80% market continues to by itself just an outdoor to be an enormous market by itself.","In other areas of the business, we are very excited about the introduction of nLight Eclipse and other components off of that, the ability to we will have some more comments on this later for the ability to separate meter. We believe it's going to allow Acuity with this lighting solutions, building automation solutions that get after that commercial office market, the installed base which is converted very, very slowly.","Primarily because most commercial buildings are socialized utilities, so it's hard to actually get down to what are you consuming in terms of energy, you just pay it based on square footage. So we're very excited about the potential of converting to that type of market as we go forward.","Ricky, other end markets I would say, we see again continued opportunities for further penetration, I think that the notion of what retail is doing, retail is looking at not just energy savings, but what more can occur there that's a big space.","Richard Reece","And I would just acknowledge the obvious that it's wherever it was more an incandescent light source in the commercial world that it's converting much more quickly than the fluorescent when you get in and as you mention indoors converting slower offices that have fluorescent, if you've upgraded to high upper T8 or T5 that's still a very energy efficient light source, so their conversion is slower, but you are now seeing LED pulling away from the lumens per watt and the capability of fluorescent.","So I do think it will accelerate there, we're very well penetrated in that indoor space, and would expect fully participate is that conversion accelerates about where it's been the fastest today is more where you've had energy sources that were less energy efficient incandescent and high pressure sodium HID that had issues not just energy, but slow to come on hard to control, those type of things that are driving this conversion.","Vernon Nagel","And lastly in the retail side I believe that folks early on found replacements to be expensive. I think that their level of satisfaction with them was not as robust, I think more and more folks are finding that replacement kits are a more effective way to do things within their home, they work better, they meet the specifications of long life that they're supposed to. If you put a bulb in a can that wasn't made to handle that kind of bulb, chances are you're going to get significantly less life then what the manufacturer may advertise. So we don't sell bulbs, but we obviously create kits that are very cost effective, and very, very efficient, that portion of our business continues to grow very nicely.","So, I believe this conversion whether it happens 5 years, 10 years, 15 years or 20 years, is just a huge, huge market and an opportunity for significant growth overtime.","Brian Lee","Great, thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objective deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the longer term continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright and we thank you for your support. Thank you.","Operator","And that concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

After today's presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you. Good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and full year results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. Such statements involve risk and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially.","Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. First, let me say we are extremely pleased with our performance in 2015. We achieved record results for virtually all financial metrics, including net sales, adjusted operating profit margin, adjusted diluted earnings per share, and cash flow generation for both the fourth quarter and full year.","For the full year and the fourth quarter, net sales grew more than 13%, which were both meaningfully higher than the estimated mid-single-digit growth rates of the key markets we served. In fact, this was the tenth quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit volume growth, a meaningful accomplishment in this environment. We believe these results are yet again a strong evidence of our strategies to provide shareholders with superior returns, customers with differentiated value-added solutions, and diversify the end-markets we serve are succeeding allowing us to extend our leadership position in North America.","These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative , energy-efficient lighting solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, and improvements in customer service and companywide productivity. Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter and full year were records for Acuity even as we continue to invest in areas to support our strong sales growth as well as opportunities with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our Digital Lighting solutions portfolio which affords us a huge opportunity to be a critical part of the backbone for enabling the Internet-of-Things.","I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights, first for the quarter. Net sales for the fourth quarter were a quarterly record of $760 million, an increase of almost 14% compared with the year ago period. Adjusted operating profit was $115.6 million compared with $90.7 million in the year ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin was a quarterly record of 15.2%, up 160 basis points from the year ago period. Adjusted diluted earnings per share were a quarterly record of $1.63, up almost 30% from the year ago period, strong quarterly results indeed.","For the full year, net sales at Acuity were a record $2.7 billion, up a little more than 13% from 2014. Our adjusted operating profit was $392 million, up almost 34%. Adjusted operating profit margin for the full year was a record 14.5%, up 230 basis points compared with the prior year. Our adjusted EPS was a record $5.39, up 36% from 2014.","In addition, we generated a record $289 million in net cash provided by operating activities this year. As Ricky will discuss later, we meaningfully enhanced our already strong financial position in 2015 ending the year with more than $750 million of cash and cash equivalents, far exceeding our debt of slightly more than $350 million. As you know, we deployed about 250 million of cash to acquire Distech Controls on September 1. We're very excited to have the Distech team now as part of the Acuity\u2019s family.","Lastly, I'm pleased to report that we once again are much more than our cost of capital. Our cash flow return on investment for 2015 was a company record of 34%, which we believe is far in excess of most others in the electrical industry. For those who follow EVA, we generated over $146 million of positive EVA this year, an outstanding achievement.","To put this performance in perspective, I would like to remind folks of two points. First, the non-residential construction market, a key market for us, is still off about 20% on an inflation-adjusted basis from its peak in 2008 and yet our net sales are up 34% since then. Second, we saw virtually no LED-based fixtures in 2008, and today those solutions make up more than 50% of our net sales. We have invested significantly to make Acuity the leader in digital lighting world over in that period of time, while at the same time delivering industry-leading financial performance for our shareholders.","These results for the quarter and the full year were significant improvements over our results in the year ago periods. We would like to provide you with more color on our results for the quarter and the year. While net sales for the fourth quarter grew almost 14% compared with the year ago period. We estimate our sales volume was up 17%. The increase in sales volume was broad-based along most product lines, channels, geographies, and verticals. We estimate the change in price mix contributed approximately two points of the difference between our sales volume and the net sales growth, while the impact of foreign currency primarily the Canadian dollar contributed one point of the difference.","While, it's not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes, we believe the price mix difference was primarily due to a shift in the mix of products sold between channels, particularly in the Home Improvement channel where we continue to experience strong growth and lower pricing unlike high in LED luminaires between periods reflecting the decline in certain LED component costs. Sales of LED products grew by almost 50% this quarter compared with the year ago period, an extraordinary achievement when one considers that sales of LED-based luminaires at Acuity now account for more than half of our total net sales, which as you know also includes non-fixture related lighting products as well.","We believe our rate of growth for LED luminaires continues to far outpace the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products and solutions demonstrating our market-leading prowess. Excluding LED luminaires, we believe the puts and takes for product pricing, as well as material and component costs were again fairly benign this quarter. Lastly, we believe our channel, product, and vertical diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new more innovative lighting solutions and the strength of our many salesforces have allowed us to again achieve meaningful sales growth this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments. As we noted earlier, our fourth quarter operating profit was $115.6 million and operating profit margin was 15.2%, both quarterly records. Our gross profit margin for the quarter was 42.3%, exactly the same as for the full year and essentially the same as the year ago period. Gross profit margin was consistent with the prior year's benefits from higher net sales, and productivity improvements were offset by changes in sales channel mix, primarily due to the accelerated growth in the Home Improvement channel and unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates.","Next, adjusted total selling, distribution, and administrative expenses were up only $12.9 million or a 7% increase on a net sales increase of almost 14%. SD&A expenses as a percentage of net sales were 27.1% in the quarter, a decrease of 170 basis points from the year ago period. The increase in our SD&A expenses was primarily due to higher variable cost for freight and selling commissions to support the record growth in net sales as well as higher employee-related cost, principally salaries as we attract new associates to expand our capabilities in order to drive our tiered solution strategy. These higher costs were partially offset by streamlining efforts and productivity gains.","Another way to view just how robust our fourth quarter results were is to examine our variable contribution margin for adjusted operating profit on the increase in net sales. In doing so, one can see our adjusted variable contribution margin was almost 28%, again strong results.","The story is much the same for the full year's record results in 2015. Net sales grew more than 13% this year, over two times the estimated growth rate of our addressable market. Gross profit margin was 42.3%, up 140 basis points compared with the prior year\u2019s gross profit margin. Adjusted operating profit margin of 14.5% grew to 230 basis points over 2014. Our adjusted variable contribution margin for the full year was almost 32%, even while we invested aggressively in areas which represent exciting growth opportunities. All-in-all we had another great year.","On a strategic front, we again accomplished a great deal in 2015, setting the stage what we believe will be a strong growth and profitability in 2016 and beyond, just a few of our key highlights. Internally, we continue to accelerate the deployment of our lean business processes, driving greater productivity and enhanced customer service. From a product and lighting solutions development perspective, we continued our rapid pace of new introductions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative energy-efficient luminaires and lighting-control solutions by introducing almost 100 new product solution sets.","We have noted in the past, we offer customers more than 1.7 million SKUs to choose from, more than three times as many as we had in 2008. To our knowledge, no other lighting company provides customers with more choices and solutions than Acuity Brands. Much of this growth in our portfolio has been driven by the expansion of our Digital Lighting Solutions portfolio, including controls.","We continue to invest in and expand our capabilities to drive our integrated, tiered solution strategy which consists of four tier levels. The purpose of this strategy is to leverage our incredibly diverse portfolio by offering customer solutions that best meet their needs, whether it would be a single device which we identify as Tier 1 or a complete holistic integrated lighting solution, which we identify as Tier 3 for their indoor and outdoor needs and everything in between, all with the promise and security from Acuity that these solutions are smart and simple, both to install and to use. This is a compelling and powerful value proposition for our customers.","While sales information for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and expanding off a small base, we believe our sales in our Tier 3 category, encompassing our holistic integrated solutions offering were up more than 40% over the year ago period. Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to provide data collection and to support connectivity to the Internet-of-Things, affording Acuity additional revenue streams which we identify as Tier 4. To fully execute this strategy of continuing to hone our organization structure to be more customer-centric, leveraging our industry-leading access to market and to better allocate resources among each of our tiers, creating the best solutions for our customers' applications.","Additionally, now that LED is widely accepted, the attention of customers is focused on how they can best control and utilize this light source to optimize their visual environment, while realizing additional benefits including energy savings and the opportunity to have a smart connected platform to enable the Internet-of-Things, because Acuity truly understands how best to fully utilize these unique capabilities of digital lighting through our smart and simple solutions for virtually any application. We believe we are uniquely positioned to grow much faster than the markets we serve.","As I have noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during areas of technology disruption and that is even more true today. As part of our tiered solution strategy, Acuity Brands is a leader in the evolution to smart buildings and smart cities. We are leveraging our deep customer knowledge, our unmatched access to market in our broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor of solid-state and traditional energy-efficiency luminaires and lighting controls, to bring truly differentiated value to customers, and we're delivering profitable growth and strong financial returns for our shareholders, while making important investments including acquisitions and strategic alliances to broaden our capabilities to serve customers.","We are very pleased that Distech Controls officially joined the Acuity family on September 1st. Distech Controls as well as our other strategic partnerships will help drive our tiered solution strategy, particularly as it relates to our holistic approach towards the advancement of smart buildings and smart cities. We expect the combination of Acuity with our broad industry-leading solid-state lighting portfolio, innovative control technologies and integrated digital solutions and Distech to contribute to our tiered solution strategy, by offering true end-to-end optimization of all aspects of the building, including enhanced occupant experience, quality visual environment, seamless operational energy efficiencies and cost reductions, as well as increased digital functionality due to a unique capability to collect vast amounts of data to better enable the Internet-of-Things for building owners.","We expect strategic opportunities such as these, coupled with our internal efforts to allow us to continue to diversify and strengthen our foundation and to further serve as a robust platform for future growth that is less reliant on the new commercial construction cycle. We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication to resolve of over almost 8,000 associates who are maniacally focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers.","I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call. I would like now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for 2016. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern and good morning everyone. Vern covered the primary drivers for our fourth quarter sales, growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items. I will provide a bit more color on our quarter's results and financial position, as well as our acquisition of Distech Controls.","I\u2019ll begin my prepared comments by providing a brief update on our streamlining activities. We recorded a 2.6 million pre-tax special charge associated with our streamlining activities related to certain headcount reductions and production transfer costs. This results in a total pre-tax special charge for fiscal year 2015 of $12.4 million. We are reinvesting a portion of the streamlining savings in additional growth initiatives, including adding new talent with different skill sets and expanding and renovating some of our facilities. However, during fiscal 2015, we have realized savings over and above the expense of these reinvestments that are approximately equal to the amount of this year\u2019s total streamlining cost.","As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, which we find useful to add back in order for the quarterly results to be more comparable. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015, we added back pre-tax $2.6 million or $0.04 per diluted EPS for special charges related to our streamlining efforts, which I just discussed previously. Pre-tax $1.2 million or $0.03 per diluted EPS for acquisition-related professional fees associated with the Distech Controls acquisition, which is a non-tax deductible expense, and a $13.1 million or $0.18 per diluted EPS net loss associated with financial instruments to hedge the foreign currency exposure related to the acquisition of Distech Controls. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures.","The effective tax rate for the fourth quarter was 34.9% compared with 33.2% in the fourth quarter of last year. The prior year effective tax rate benefited from favorable adjustments to certain income tax discrete items, which did not recur in the current year. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 to be 35.5% before any discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","Cash flow generated from operations for fiscal year 2015 was an impressive $288.9 million, which is a 55.8 million or 24% increase over the prior year. We did a good job of managing our operating working capital, defined as receivables plus inventories less payables this fiscal year as our operating working capital days decreased by one day to 32 days, which we believe is industry-leading.","For the fiscal year August 31, 2015, we spent $56.5 million for capital expenditures, compared with $35.3 million in the prior year. This uptick in capital expenditures compared with recent prior years is primarily due to investments necessary to support our growth, including tooling for new products, the expansion in our electronics capacity and the build out of our innovation and technology center in metro Atlanta, as well as expenditures related to certain projects that were delayed from the prior fiscal year. We currently expect to spend approximately 2.5% of revenues in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2016.","At August 31, 2015, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $756.8 million, an increase of 204.3 million since August 31, 2014. Our total debt was 352 million net of discounts and deferred amortization cost, consequently our cash exceeded debt at the end of the fiscal year. At August 31, 2015, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million under our credit facility. We clearly have significant financial strength and flexibility and we\u2019ll continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","I will conclude with some additional comments on the Distech Controls acquisition. On September 1, 2015, just after our fiscal year-end we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of Distech Controls for approximately CAD318 million net of cash acquired, or approximately $244 million which we use cash on-hand. Because of significant volatility in the U.S. and Canadian dollar exchange rate over the last year or so, we thought it prudent to enter into foreign currency contracts in an effort to mitigate nearly all of the foreign currency exposure associated with the Canadian dollar purchase price.","Because U.S. GAAP does not allow a hedge of a commitment to acquire a business to receive hedge accounting treatment a net pre-tax loss on these contracts totaling $2.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share was recognized in net miscellaneous income for fiscal year 2015. The hedges achieved their stated purpose of protecting us against currency fluctuation in the Canadian dollar purchase price, resulting in the actual purchase price after hedging transactions in U.S. dollars being slightly less than the U.S. dollar purchase price we assumed in our evaluation of Distech Controls.","Distech Controls generated net sales in excess of CAD80 million during the fiscal year ended August 31, 2015 and enjoyed a five year annual growth rate of over 25%. Almost half of Distech Controls sales were in the U.S., about a third in Europe, less than 10% in Canada and the remainder spread broadly around the rest of the world. The operating profit margin of Distech Controls is similar to Acuity. We expect Distech Controls will be modestly accretive through our fiscal 26 consolidated financial results.","Thank you and I'll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving, particularly for Acuity. Our expectations for growth of the lighting industry primarily in North America has not changed much over the last few quarters, in spite of some noise to the contrary. We remain very positive. So while we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to provide you with some observations we have for fiscal 2016. First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest, but increasing pace. While forecast for industry growth rates vary by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate for the broad lighting market in North America is still expected to grow in the mid to upper single-digit range for our fiscal 2016. The continued favorable trend in our September order rate again seems to support this continuing level of improvement.","Further, we continue to see signs that give us optimism regarding the longer term future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators for the North American market such as architectural billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption and lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve, though never in an absolute straight line, while residential construction continues to grow nicely. Excluding the price of certain LED components which are expected to continue to decline, we do not anticipate significant changes in input costs for our fiscal 2016 as we expect some commodity cost away while other could rise. Further, we expect employee-related cost to continue to increase as we invest in people skills necessary to execute our tiered solutions strategy, wage inflation and the negative impact of rising healthcare cost. To help offset these potential higher costs, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture, as well as furthering our efforts to drive productivity improvements to help deliver continued favorable contribution margin and incrementally higher sales.","Next, we continue to be lairy of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations which are impossible to predict. Another observation, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors including sales volume, price, product and sales channel mix, as well as innovation, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve overtime as volumes grow, particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix especially as we execute our tiered solution sales strategy and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies.","Our gross profit margin improvement in 2015 was a good example of our potential as we prefer to look at our margin improvement over 12 month periods to discern proper trends by removing quarterly anomalies. You should do the same. As you saw in 2015, it is a positive picture. Additionally, while we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and sales channels, we will continue to be vigilant on pricing. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly and most importantly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform, including the introduction of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting solutions that for example connects smart lighting to smartphones for retailers, as well as our growing electronic component capabilities. As we have noted in our last several conference calls, while our strategy is to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnect of world is really the next logical step in the evolution of our overall growth strategy. This includes expected benefits from the acquisition of Distech, which we believe will meaningfully expand our addressable market, as well as add much greater opportunities to offer customers even more broad-based holistic solutions to optimize the performance of their facilities.","Our company-wide strategy is straightforward, expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We are funding these activities today because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. Our record growth supports this view.","As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront along with emerging opportunities for digital lighting to play a key role in the Internet-of-Things. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of our broader lighting industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential. As the North American market leader, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Mr. Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray. Sir, you may proceed.","Mike Ritzenthaler","Just wanted to kick it off here by asking about the 17% volume growth, I realized it's kind of difficult to parse into different end-markets, but I am wondering if there is any way to tell what the contribution was from new construction versus retrofitting activities in terms of how you view the end-markets?","Vern Nagel","Again, a very difficult question for us to answer, we still believe that the mix of our business is roughly 50% new construction, 50% renovation, which contrasted. I've seen some data around Dodge trying to collect information around what's the difference between new versus renovation, and that number is probably more like an 80\/20 or 75\/25. So, Acuity continues to do an excellent job of diversifying its access to market in the types of projects that it works on, and looking at our overall sales volume growth of 17%, it was very diversified in many-many channels. We continue to experience again solid growth in our Home Improvement business, our International business, our Utility business. The C&I project business was excellent. Again renovation, we continue to see good successes there, so overall I feel that our topline was really quite exceptional in terms of the overall volume growth. Our gas, we don't know because we're a little bit off, we lag a little bit if you will the data that comes out, but my guess is that our fourth quarter the overall growth rate of the lighting market will probably be in that mid to upper single-digit range. So, showing us at 17% again more than two times the overall growth rate of the market is pretty significant.","Mike Ritzenthaler","On the recent collaborations with Sensity, and then I guess just the other day with Silver Spring, will there be anything in the results or any commentary that you will be able to provide in the upcoming kind of 12-month period to be able to tell those partnerships are bearing fruit. I know today you gave a little bit more color on the Tier 3 solutions, is that something that we should be looking for, a little bit more granularity around whether those collaborations are bearing fruit?","Vern Nagel","Good question. We will be providing more and more information around our tiered solutions approach, and again it's coming off of small base, we know that in the past we've sold individual discrete components, and so that\u2019s easy to measure. But as we continue to offer more and more solutions that are holistic and integrated, particularly when we now bring Distech into the fold, these will be broad-based Acuity solutions and the partnerships that we have or the relationships that we have with others such as Sensity and Silver Spring, those types of things will help to drive both a Tier 3 and Tier 4 revenue solution, and we'll try to provide more cover, but we really have to get our definitions right, we have to get the data collection process right, we need to get people quoting things right so that we're able to provide more precise information there, and we'll do that, but it will take a bit of time before we can really provide you with I think great clarity around that. And it's important that we do that, because we believe very strongly that this tiered solutions approach which we think Acuity is uniquely positioned to provide will add greater margin capability and greater sales growth capability particularly as we drive these technologies and these capabilities to our end-vertical customers.","Operator","Our next question is from Mr. Ryan Merkel of William Blair. Sir, your line is open.","Ryan Merkel","So the first question was, one of your larger peers mentioned that lighting trends have slowed a bit in July and that non-res construction might be softening a bit, did you see any of this as you went through the quarter and is there any large project delay to speak of?","Vern Nagel","We suspected that it would take one or two questions before we got this question. So it's interesting to us, we are a pure play lighting company, but we're broadening very aggressively our capabilities to provide more content, more capability for building owners, smart cities, as well as smart buildings. The Distech acquisition will be very accretive to us offering more solution set. So when we look at the broad industry and we look at that non-residential world, we see both new construction, we see renovation, we see pockets in various channels, various geographies. And I have to tell you that over the last decade and I think I\u2019ve been doing this that long and maybe even a little longer, we\u2019re always experiencing pockets that seem to ebb and flow, but overall the direction that we see and the context that we get back from our channel partners, our customers is still a very favorable picture, and that picture is primarily -- and is driven by both the opportunity for new construction activities, and it depends on the vertical. So if you\u2019re a person that\u2019s in a geography that is robustly connected to schools for example, and you\u2019re probably seeing outsized growth relative to some of maybe in a manufacturing environment where things could potentially have to be a little slower in that geography, due to dollar strength, due to other things.","So, we look at the whole picture. In our view, it is still very favorable around the opportunities that are before us in the marketplace. So, I can\u2019t really comment on what others have seen or are seeing, but from our perspective I think our fourth quarter is a good example of the opportunity to grow, outsize the growth rates of the markets we serve, because of the channel diversification and also because of the opportunities that digital lighting energy efficiency brings to the marketplace. You actually can sell paybacks to businesses and to communities that are looking to improve the quality of their life, improve the quality of their energy efficiency, and now with Distech the opportunity really to enhance their physical environment as well. We just see solid growth there.","Ryan Merkel","And then the second question on gross margin. Is it fair to conclude that the reason the gross margin was a little bit lower this quarter versus the prior quarter is because price mix was neutral last quarter that it was down two points this quarter? Is that the conclusion?","Vern Nagel","For us the gross profit margin was strong this quarter, it was very strong if you will in the third quarter. We continue to do excellent work in expanding in markets that for example the Home Improvement channel and I\u2019ll just use that as an example, that channel which is a fantastic channel for Acuity has showed continued growth. Well, that\u2019s a situation where we\u2019re selling limited SKUs generally high volume, that\u2019s the nature of that business. So, the cost to serve that business is different than the cost to say serve a large project that is a huge building for example.","And so, the margin dynamics at gross profit and our SG&A expenses are just different in serving these various channels. And that\u2019s true of all of our channels. Our International business this quarter continued to show a revival that\u2019s vitality, well the margin dynamics are a little bit different. So, I think what you saw in this fourth quarter was very-very outstanding sales volume growth and the mix of that business was a little bit different than say the third quarter, which resulted in just a little bit different what I\u2019ll call the gross profit profile, but I want to bring you all back down to our operating profit. Our operating profit in the quarter was 15.2% which was a record and our variable contribution off of this fourth quarter was almost 28% and that\u2019s well within the range of what we like to talk about.","The overall year our variable contribution was 32% and again that\u2019s fantastic, but we continue to invest in our business, our fourth quarter saw a ramp-up in some of our people cost, because we\u2019ve added people to help us drive our tiered solution strategy. So, I think all of that came into play, but very proud with how the organization drove its 15.2% operating profit margin.","Operator","The next question is from Mr. Christopher Glynn of Oppenheimer. Sir, your line is open.","Christopher Glynn","So on some of the variation Vern maybe this is just an extension of what you\u2019ve been answering. But the price mix going to minus two from flat and then minus a point in the first half, is this headed anywhere on a normalized trend or still just for the foreseeable couple of years any given quarter could come in anywhere within a range really?","Vern Nagel","Chris this is again why in our comments we like to look at the full year not any one quarter, we\u2019re always susceptible to sort of quarterly fluctuations. But I think that when we look at not only the fourth quarter but the full year, the trend is very favorable. I mean we improved our gross profit margins for the full year on a robust basis. And if you look at where we\u2019re going with our tiered solution strategy, the ability to now bring Distech, we have optimism that overtime we will continue to improve our gross profit, we\u2019ll continue to leverage our SDA and as a result you\u2019ll continue to see improvement in our overall operating profit margins.","Christopher Glynn","And then Vern you referenced due to symbolically or literally the Home Retail channel can be strong at times. Was there any shelf space still in the quarter, or was the top-line trend kind of a peace with what\u2019s ongoing?","Vern Nagel","Well, the Home Improvement channel and as you know we are strategic aligned with one particular customer that we have a great partnership and we\u2019re driving growth both for them and for us, and so we see them taking share, we see them continuing to invest aggressively in the lighting solution side of their business, they're putting in products that continue to have both higher average selling prices, as well as ones that continue to be very competitively priced and with the Acuity in this case Lithonia brand behind it, it really provides the opportunity for them to differentiate in both their light construction, as well as remodel and residential side. So, we're seeing good growth. We're also seeing the opportunity to gain share as we provide to them new solution sets where they prefer ours versus others. And so, we're experiencing that growth as well. But the Home Improvement channel, we think represents a great opportunity on a go-forward basis because of the customer base that they touch and the way they touch them. And that model is just a little different than say the C&I model. It\u2019s a little different than utility model, so that's the beauty of what Acuity has done over the last decade or so, we've really worked hard to diversify the sales channels that we sell through, the verticals that we touch and geographies that we're doing, so that we\u2019re less tied to the new construction cycle. And I think that's why you're continuing to see Acuity or a reason why you're continuing to see Acuity outperform the growth rates of the market, the lighting market overall.","Christopher Glynn","And then I\u2019ve been getting asked more about international strategy, what you guys may or may not contemplate. So I was just wondering if you could update kind of when, if, how, why overseas opportunity might be compelling for you?","Vern Nagel","Sure, we have -- we've touched the globe. We've touched the globe through exports, we have a nice little base in Europe, both in Spain as well in the UK that touches the industrial and the outdoor market. Our approach internationally has been and I believe it will continue to be a vertical approach. And when we say international, I just would like to be clear we say outside of North America, we are extremely excited by the success that our folks are having in Mexico, we have a great team there. We see great growth there. The Canadian folks are doing very well. So, that we call North America and when we say international it's outside of that.","We continue to push our vertical approach there, and we continue to follow customers around the globe, take for example large retailers, when you look at Acuity's capabilities from an LED perspective, I'll call it a more holistic digital lighting experience and then you couple that with our ability to have in-store positioning, retailers that are around the globe continue to be prime customers and opportunities for Acuity, that's just an example. And outdoor roadways, smart cities around the globe continue to be an opportunity for Acuity and then we are strong in the industrial space around the globe with our Holophane brand. So, we'll continue to push those on a vertical and geographical and customer strategy.","Ricky Reece","And I would add, with the Distech acquisition, they have a presence in Lyon, France that we can also leverage along with the other businesses we have in Europe and provide that broad holistic solution outside North America, as well as within North America.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Matt McCall of BB&T Capital Markets. Sir, your line is open.","Matt McCall","So, Vern you talked a lot about the investment in people and I'm curious, you did a good job on SG&A really this quarter, but the whole year. Has there been, when you are talking about the tiering approach and the tiering strategy, has there been a big salesforce training element to it that maybe the SG&A line could have been even better this year if it weren\u2019t for the investments that you had to make upfront introducing this strategy?","Vern Nagel","Certainly, training is a critical element in enhancing the selling forces that we have, Acuity is blessed, that it sells through many-many different channels, and in virtually every one of those channels we\u2019re associated with the number selling force, whether it's our rep agency or whether it's the utility side, you pick it, the Holophane sales team they are the best in the business. So, our ability to leverage our access to market is critical. What is going to be important is that we continue to bring solution sets, whether again talking about the tiered solution strategy but these solution sets particularly in Tier 3 and 4 for holistic capabilities. So, that would include Distech, that also includes the Internet-of-Things. So, making sure that those things work are important, but our Tier 1 and Tier 2 strategies are critically important as a foundational element, because that's where a lot of projects will continue to evolve and whether it's new construction or renovation that will want those types of solutions. So, we're investing in people to be able to again it\u2019s software, it\u2019s controls, it\u2019s additional lighting capacity, it's the guts of how fixtures, digital fixtures work. It's app writers, it's all sorts of things that bring value that are different than in the analogue days of say 2008, where it was a fluorescent fixture and it was fairly simple to make and there wasn't a lot of technology change. So, we're investing in people to really get after a number of these solution sets that are just so interesting because of how we're evolving in this digital world.","Matt McCall","Maybe if I take a step further, the contribution margin this year really saw a 40% to 30%, a couple of the quarters on a year-over-year basis looks like it was driven by gross margin, the other couple of quarters it was driven by SG&A leverage, when you look at to next year I am trying to kind of put all these factor product mix, project mix, growth of Tiers 3 and 4, more people cost, productivity when you think about the fact that you are facing a 30% incremental margin comp, how do you want us to think about incremental margin for the full year of \u201916?","Vern Nagel","And so Matt what we had suggested in past calls is that we're comfortable targeting a variable contribution rate of mid to upper 20s. Obviously our objective is to take that variable contribution number as high as we possibly can, but we see investment opportunities right now that are just so important to make today because in making these investments we believe we'll be able to drive even higher variable contribution margins in the future particularly as we leverage our capabilities in Tier 3 and Tier 4 particularly as we create holistic solutions with Distech that are going to be real value-add capabilities to customers that don't exist today.","So these investments I believe that the Acuity team feels that our variable contribution margin over a 12 month period is probably in that mid to upper 20% range. But you're going to see quarters where we are north of that number. The full year 2015 was excellent at 32% and our goal is to outperform what we comment on and our hope and our expectation is to execute our strategies and deliver on a favorable number to what we're suggesting here, but we're confident on that kind of mid to upper 20% variable contribution range. And as we see out over the more mid-term future, we see that variable contribution number improving nicely and it will come in both levering or excuse me both in our gross profit margin as we discussed earlier, as well as leveraging our SDA area.","I\u2019d like to point out that at 34% cash flow return on investment that's a pretty robust number, so we've done a pretty good job of managing our business, it's kind of interesting. And if you go back 12 months, our salaried headcount relative to where we are today is essentially flat, but yet as you know we took a number of streamlining actions earlier in the year so we've added capability and capacity back into the business but in a very different way. I mean we're truly restructuring the business as we go forward.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is from Mr. Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo Securities. Sir, your line is open.","Rich Kwas","On just a question, first question on variable SD&A, any changes to the run rate here versus the 105 million or so that has been realized over the last couple of quarters?","Vern Nagel","Well, I believe we prefer to look at our variable contribution rate because our expectation is, is that we will meaningfully outperform the markets, the growth rates of the markets we serve. So we will continue to add capability to help support that, but I think we've done a very good job of driving productivity in our business. We know how to do these kinds of things, so you will continue to see leveraging of our SDA cost but I think you should expect and take it to an illogical strength when we double our business we\u2019re going to be doubling that fixed SDA. The question is at what rate? And Ricky and I and other folks here at Acuity are comfortable with the variable contribution rate kind of in that mid to upper 20s and so then therefore you can see how that is not really fixed and how that portion of the SDA would grow in your business model.","Rich Kwas","So it's tracked with the fixed piece of tracking a bit more than 115 and 120 is a reasonable way to think about it for a quarter?","Vern Nagel","Well again, I am not trying to be difficult but I think it depends on what your timeframe is. We will continue to add capability to our organization, human capability where those salaries will come into that bucket that you're talking about. So I would expect that those numbers will continue to improve, but it's improving off of a very large sales growth rate because of the opportunities that we see. Acuity I think has done a good job of making sure that it's driving sales growth so that it can reinvest in its business, as opposed to trying to invest in its business under the hope of having sales. And that's a delicate balance and not one that easily done, but yet we've been able to accomplish that feat. Ricky do you have anything?","Ricky Reece","The only other comment which is to make sure obviously now Distech will start consolidating them here in the first quarter of \u201916 and they have some SG&A cost as well that will come in to that base number in addition to the investments that we will be growing, so you'll need to factor that in, into your thinking as well.","Rich Kwas","And then just on Distech, do we think of this over the next year or so as from a go-to-market strategy a separate or are you going to be able to integrate where the channels are going to be able to provide a offer, holistic offering and there is synergies on that front, how long Vern do you think it takes for the growth to be accelerated if you will?","Vern Nagel","Excellent question. We see these two channels and opportunities to effect channels selling through system integrators primarily us having 14 different channels that the opportunity for these folks to continue to drive their business. But where we see the ability to be collectively accretive is bringing together a holistic combination of a solution set that not only involves lighting but involves security, involves HVAC and access all of this information energy to provide it back to a building owner in a very simple and holistic way, we think that\u2019s a real value proposition. And so what we\u2019ll look to do is to work in those local markets with those local customers and those local reps to bring even more capability.","We still have some work to do to figure out exactly how that\u2019s going to work in a local market, but the customer will dictate it for us how they want to be served. And we\u2019re very excited about what that means in terms of how building owners will be able to drive their business and their capabilities. So I think that over this next 12 months or so we\u2019ll figure those types of things out very specifically. We have working hypothesis around these, the teams are working together exceedingly well. We\u2019re getting different types of folks to come together to talk about how not only do we have if you will these two channels or this new channel, but the opportunity to actually creating more capability for the customer. And how we get to that customer with that solution set we\u2019re still working that and there are many other folks out there that are in the channel that Acuity didn\u2019t have access to before and now with Distech as part of the family we have access to those folks to really pitch them on the benefit of the combined Acuity\/Distech.","Rich Kwas","Just as a quick one before I give it off. Commodity benefit, I know you talked about the fiscal \u201916 kind of neutral. But I would think that you get some benefit as you look at diesel costs and other metals cost, resin cost et cetera that go into your product. So are you just assuming that there is other overhead costs that offset that or what\u2019s the rationale behind 2016?","Vern Nagel","So our expectation is, is that those cost I mean they have the potential to continue to decline but they also have the potential to go up so our feeling was is that we sort of see a net neutral to the extent that it turns out to be more favorable fantastic. Most of our business is a bp business sometimes that finds its way sometimes we\u2019re able to bring a portion of that through the bottom-line. But the other thing that I would say is our expectations are that there are other costs that are not directly related to commodity cost such as healthcare cost just to pick one, wage inflation. Forget about just adding new people wage inflation we think is alive and well and so how do you manage those types of things. So, to the extent that we\u2019re able to drive productivity, to the extent that we\u2019re able to take cost out of our business, to the extent that we\u2019re able to get benefits from lower commodity cost our own too sense is that it probably has the potential just to be kind of the net neutral at this point in time, we\u2019ll know more as we get into the year. Ricky do you have any other?","Ricky Reece","No, I think that\u2019s right I mean the combination of other cost as Vern highlighted that will offset some of that particularly related around compensation and benefit cost given the dynamics there. And then that defines its way in the market, it\u2019s pretty public what steel, aluminum and all is selling at and it does find its way into the market both directions. We try to keep as much we as an industry and we as a company as we can, but the reality is a lot of that does find its way back into the market.","Vern Nagel","And all of you know this, I mean the regulatory environment continues to grow unabated and so we can see different parts of our business where we enhance, we had to change, alter, invest in compliance to meet some of these new requirements and things. So those are at a cost that come into our business for which no one will face to a price increase on. So that\u2019s why our view is, is that at this point in time the puts and takes are probably pretty even right now.","Operator","The next question is from Ms. Kathryn Thompson of Thompson Research Group. Ma\u2019am the line is open.","Kathryn Thompson","First question is more focused on the top-line, trends we\u2019re seeing in the later cycle building product categories, including the office future industries increasing orders from small and medium sized businesses, which is largely been absent in the cycle. And this is interesting because generally these small and medium sized businesses typically lead a cycle which hasn\u2019t been the case in current cycle. Are you seeing changes in orders from different size to that small and medium sized businesses in recent months? And is there a margin profile difference for these types of projects? Thank you.","Vern Nagel","Kathy it\u2019s interesting for us we're not economist, we look at the right data, it's interesting to hear some of the pundits who are smart in the space, Barry Sternlicht was on our show the other day. He was talking about hotels how lodging rates are improving and apartment buildings, monthly rental rates are improving. In office buildings you're seeing rising rents around the country, and you're seeing the whole notion of vacancy rates declining, office demand improving. All of these things I believe are driving not just later stage, but the opportunity for Acuity in our industry to continue show growth. The employment figure, which employment is modestly improving, and that unemployment is down. All of those bode really well for our business. Nothing goes up in a straight line, you all know that. And so overall, we think the trends are favorable and yes I would say that our business has been built more around at least in the trailing 12 months, around more small medium kinds of things, renovation as well than big large massive project, we've done those as well and they are out there.","But what is interesting to us as we travel around and visit with customers and visit with our own associates, this trend is everywhere and it's impressive to see and that is a normal part of the cycle when -- this isn't like you're going to decide to go buy a pair of tennis shoes one day because you got a race, when you're building these huge buildings and you're doing different things and you're making these long-term investments, they take time. So, we believe that we're still in the early part of this uptick in the cycle. And then you add on top of that the whole notion of I mean to use the word renovation, but it's more than that, selling value propositions to that in the past all was that all my life fixtures are perfectly fine. Now you're selling energy, now you're selling the connected world, now you're selling Distech environmental if you will energy control solutions, you're selling Internet-of-Things. So, your value proposition has changed dramatically and a lot of the big players that would move on that, they're evaluating these types of things.","So, we believe we're in the really early stages of this rather large move. And from a profit profile, it really depends, every job is different, depends on who and why and what value add you've had in there. I don't think that it's precise to say that because it's a large project, you make more money, because it's a small project you make less money from the margin perspective. It just really depends and fortunately for Acuity we're good at all sized projects and that's been our strength for a long time.","Kathryn Thompson","Vern having just moved into a new office and having the new lighting solutions including some of your own again a great bet and as we look at our window we have about five cranes, so they are certainly seeing that at Acuity headquarters. A follow-up question on margins and this is really just a little bit longer term focus as you focus on more technology focused acquisitions and partnerships as you grow your tiered solutions, how does this change your margin profile over the next two to four years? Theoretically it should see at least on the gross margin side a bump up , but may be help us think about more mid to long-term, what tiered solutions do to your margin profile? Thank you.","Vern Nagel","It\u2019s a great question. Our expectation is, is that as we are able to bring again more holistic integrated solutions and this includes Distech into a building. And think about how someone who is managing your building, their opportunity to make their lives smart in technology that's simple to use. We believe there is a unique capability that Acuity and Distech will have. And so as a consequence of change in that type of we\u2019ll call it Tier 3 integrated holistic solution, where it's more elegant, it's more efficient, it's more simple even though it's very-very sophisticated. We think that will resonate with folks and so therefore we would expect a higher margin profile.","When we think about Tier 4, what's Tier 4 for us, our alternate revenue streams, the notion of how providing users whoever it doesn't matter who that user is, but users with the ability to have data because between Distech and its capabilities and where digital lighting is in Acuity and our capabilities, we think we\u2019ll have the ability to cash up probably 85% of the data that is being generated in a building. And you can also take this to smart cities and outdoors as well. Well, the opportunity to do that we think is a unique revenue stream and we can take all the verticals we can see that there are value propositions there are -- and so Acuity 12 months ago if someone said do you have app writers on-board, we would have said no, today we have 12.","The opportunity to create these solution sets because of what our transformation has done and where we are in our Tier 3 solution, these app writers are creating solution sets that will allow us to generate revenues that should have very nice margins in that section. So, we over a longer term period we would expect to see our gross profit margin profile improve, we would expect us to leverage our SDA and we would expect that our offering profit margins would reflect that as well. At some point in time here we're going to come back and say, no we don't think that our variable contribution margin of the high 20s is the right number anymore. We think it should be in the high 30s, but we're not there today. That's the kind of the transformation that we expect to see over the next handful of years.","Operator","And now I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vern Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe we're focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies in driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the longer term continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support."],"481":["Acuity Brands Inc.

Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions.","First off, our results for the second quarter of 2014 were very strong despite some noise in the quarter, as I will explain in a moment. Our net sales increased over 12% this quarter while our EPS grew 21% compared with adjusted EPS last year. In fact, this was the fourth quarter in a row where we achieved double-digit sales volume growth. The level of growth this quarter is even more remarkable given the negative impact of unusually severe weather conditions in many parts of the U.S. this winter as well as tough comparisons to the year-ago quarter, as I will explain later as well. Also noteworthy, sales of LED-based luminaires now make up 30% of our net sales. ","We believe this level of growth is yet again positive evidence our strategies to provide our customers with differentiated value propositions and to diversify the end markets we serve are succeeding, allowing us to extend our leadership position in North America. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting solutions, expansion in key channels and geographies, and improvements in customer service and company-wide productivity.","Our profitability and cash flow for the quarter were again strong, even as we continued to fund our robust sales growth in areas with significant future growth potential, including the expansion of our lighting solutions portfolio. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter; however, before doing so I would like to address the issues that gave rise to the noise, if you will, in our second quarter numbers. It is important you understand these unusual items.","First, we discovered a design issue with an older incandescent emergency lighting product. As a result, we accrued a liability of $2.4 million for this matter in the quarter. Second, the impact of foreign currency primarily due to a weakening Canadian dollar reduced our gross profit approximately $3 million. As Ricky will explain later, it is unusual for us to experience this level of foreign currency impact. Third, we experienced much higher than normal inbound freight costs to expedite certain components for certain fixtures from vendors in order to service greater than forecasted customer demand. We believe these three items reduced our gross profit margin in the quarter by approximately 100 basis points. The total impact of these items reduced diluted EPS this quarter by approximately $0.09. We have taken appropriate actions in the second quarter to address the design and freight issues. We of course remain somewhat exposed to currency fluctuations as they are very difficult to anticipate.","Lastly as I noted earlier, our sales grew double digits again this quarter even though the unusually severe weather conditions in many parts of the country impacted both customer demand as well as efficiencies in our operations. While it is impossible to quantify the exact impact the severe weather conditions had on our results, we believe sales were reduced by as much as 3% in the second quarter. We have made no estimate on the inefficiencies to our operations caused by the various winter storms, though it is clear we lost a variable contribution from the sales shortfall and we incurred higher costs to serve our customers, yet we still delivered upper quartile results. While we consider all of these items unusual and infrequent, we are not adjusting our reported GAAP numbers to reflect their impact even though by not doing so, it does underestimate the very positive comparison to the prior year. ","Now let us review our reported results for the quarter. Net sales for the quarter were $546 million, an increase of 12% compared with the year-ago period. Reported operating profit for the quarter was $58.4 million compared with $45.1 million reported in the year-ago period, an increase of almost 30%. In the year-ago period, we took a special charge and incurred temporary manufacturing inefficiencies associated with a plant closure, which in total reduced operating profit by $3.1 million. I do find it helpful to add back these items to the year-ago period\u2019s results to make them comparable. Doing so, one can see that operating profit for the current quarter compared with adjusted operating profit in the year-ago period increased 21% while operating profit margin increased 80 basis points. Again, remember we are not adjusting the current quarter\u2019s results for the unusual noise items, which lowered gross profit margin by approximately 100 basis points.","Diluted earnings per share for the second quarter were $0.75 while adjusted diluted EPS for the year-ago period was $0.62, an increase of 21%. Again, our results this quarter were impacted by approximately $0.09 for those unusual items \u2013 still very strong results indeed. ","The results for the quarter were significant improvements over the year-ago period. We believe you will find them even more impressive upon further analysis. While net sales grew 12% compared with a year ago, we estimate sales volume grew approximately 13% this quarter. This level of growth is particularly noteworthy on a number of fronts. First, as we explained last quarter, we believe the second quarter a year ago benefited from sales volume that was pushed into the second quarter from the first quarter as customers were taking a wait-and-see approach caused by election budget issues in the U.S. at that time. In fact, sales are usually down sequentially in the second quarter from the first quarter due to the seasonal nature of the construction cycle, and yet last year net sales were actually up 1% in the second quarter over the first quarter, making our top line growth this quarter all the more impressive when compared with the strong second quarter a year ago. ","Second as I noted earlier, foreign currency primarily due to a weakening Canadian dollar reduced net sales by approximately 1%. Additionally, the impact on net sales of price changes and the mix of products sold, as well as acquisitions, were not significant this quarter compared to the year-ago period. Lastly as I noted earlier, unusually severe weather conditions during the quarter negatively impacted sales volume, and yet we still grew over 12%.","Overall, our growth in net sales was broad-based along virtually all major product lines, though certain specialty fixtures more closely associated with new construction continued to lag the overall average due to the still tepid environment for new, larger non-residential construction projects. Interestingly, orders for these types of products were much improved, suggesting the beginning of a rebound for commercial projects in the U.S. ","From a sales channel perspective, we continued to experience strong growth in the commercial, industrial and infrastructure channels for both indoor and outdoor applications, as well as continued growth for renovation projects. Sales growth in our largest channel \u2013 commercial industrial \u2013 contributed to this quarter\u2019s overall percentage increase primarily due to smaller and medium sized indoor and outdoor projects for both new construction and renovation, as well as a continued emphasis on selling higher value-added lighting solutions, especially LED luminaires, which again more than doubled compared with the year-ago period. The sale of LED-based fixtures at Acuity now accounts for 30% of our total revenues. In fact, each quarter for the last three and a half years in a row, sales of LED products at Acuity have more than doubled compared with the year-ago periods. We believe this level of growth is far outpacing the growth rates of our largest competitors for these types of products, further demonstrating our formidable capabilities in product development and our leadership in market access.","Let me put this in perspective for you. If the sales of our LED-based luminaires were measured as a separate business, we believe today it would be the fourth largest lighting company in North America; and remember, it\u2019s 30% of our total business. These are powerful results indeed.","Additionally, we enjoyed growth in our residential products as demand for new housing and renovation of existing homes continued to rebound. Overall, we continued to experience growth in most geographies and sales channels in North America, all of which is very encouraging. Excluding LED luminaires, we believe the puts and takes for product pricing as well as material and component costs were, again, fairly benign this quarter. ","Looking at overall market conditions for the second quarter, we believe spending in the U.S. non-residential construction market in which we participate was up low to mid-single digits compared with a year ago, while residential construction was up almost 20%. We believe the growth rate in these markets was hampered by the severe weather conditions mentioned earlier; therefore while complete market data for the quarter is not yet available, we believe the overall lighting market grew in the mid-single digit range during the quarter supported by growth in renovation as well as the residential market. This is in stark contrast compared with our net sales growth, which was up more than 12% in spite of the weather issues noted earlier.","Lastly, we believe our sales channel product diversification, as well as our strategy to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to achieve meaningful sales growth again this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments in the quarter. Operating profit margin for the second quarter was a solid 10.7%, up 80 basis points compared with adjusted margin in the year-ago period. This is particularly noteworthy given that the sales of LED luminaires are now 30% of our total net sales. Further, as Ricky will discuss later in the call, while gross profit margin declined by 20 basis points to 39.4% from the prior year\u2019s adjusted gross profit margin, the margin decline was primarily due to the unusual items I noted earlier, which reduced gross profit margin by 100 basis points. This was partially offset by benefits from higher sales volume, productivity gains, and previous restructuring actions, as well as lower cost for certain LED components. As I noted earlier, the impact of price and the mix of products sold was benign this quarter compared with the year-ago period. ","Next, total selling, distribution and administrative expenses were up almost 9% on a sales increase of more than 12%. The increase in total SDA expense was due primarily to higher variable cost for commissions and freight to support the growth in net sales, as well as higher employee-related costs, including incentive compensation partially offset by benefits from previously implemented restructuring programs. Incentive compensation expense was higher compared with the year-ago period due to the significant improvement in year-over-year performance this year. SDA expenses as a percentage of net sales were 28.7% in the current quarter compared with adjusted SDA expense of 29.7% in the year-ago period, an improvement of 100 basis points \u2013 all in all, a very strong second quarter for Acuity.","On the strategic front, we\u2019ve continued our rapid pace of introductions of new products, significantly expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions. As I mentioned earlier, our solid state lighting portfolio continues to expand rapidly, as are the sales of these luminaires, and we continue to fund the development of more holistic lighting and energy saving solutions for specific applications such as schools, healthcare facilities, commercial office buildings, and various outdoor applications to fully leverage our award-winning portfolio of lighting fixtures, controls and components. ","As we have noted before, Acuity is a clear leader in digital lighting solutions. Our expertise lies in the true understanding of the proper use and control of light in end vertical applications while minimizing the use of energy. We are without equal in the design and development of fixtures and integrated lighting systems for virtually any indoor and outdoor application without a bias of the light source. This expertise, coupled with a fully integrated lean supply chain allows us to cost effectively produce an extremely wide range of energy efficient lighting solutions for our customers, and we are aggressively adding additional capabilities through strategic acquisitions, such as eldoLAB, and making capital investments to more vertically integrate fixtures and controls to provide smart and simple solutions for key end market applications. These capabilities and our structure allow us to provide customers with superior value while delivering upper quartile results for our shareholders. ","We have been able to produce these robust results because of the dedication and resolve of our more than 6,500 associates to deliver superior value to our customers as well as driving improvements and efficiencies throughout the company to provide superior returns for our shareholders. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and expectations for the construction market later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2014. Ricky?","Richard Reece","Thank you Vern, and good morning everyone. I\u2019ll highlight a few items regarding our income statement. I then will discuss our cash flow and financial condition before turning the call back to Vern. Vern covered the primary drivers for our sales growth and our profitability, so I\u2019ll not repeat these items; but I will provide a bit more color on certain aspects of our first quarter results. ","Our gross profit margin for our second fiscal quarter of 39.4% decreased 20 basis points compared with the adjusted year-ago period. As Vern mentioned earlier, the benefits of the 12% increase in net sales, lower material and component costs primarily related to LED fixtures, and benefits from greater manufacturing utilization and improved productivity were offset by the noise of 100 basis point reduction in gross margin due to the product design issue, unfavorable currency impact, and increase in expedited inbound freight.","The unfavorable currency impact was primarily due to the over 8% weakening of the Canadian dollar year-over-year relative to the U.S. dollar. This somewhat unusual occurrence is primarily due to two factors: one, the speed of this decline; and two, the fact that we did not see a corresponding decline in the Mexican peso. Historically, there has been a fairly close correlation with the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso since both of these countries\u2019 economies are highly levered to energy and commodities, so as goes energy and commodity prices, so too goes the relative strength of their currencies. Acuity is long Canadian dollars and short Mexican pesos, so we tend to have a natural hedge. Since this large Canadian dollar movement was much more than that of the Mexican peso this quarter, the natural hedge was not as effective and we experienced approximately $3 million negative impact on our gross profit.","Despite this reduction in gross profit margin, our operating profit margin increased 80 basis points to 10.7% compared with the adjusted operating margin in the year-ago period. Adjusted operating profit margin increased by $10 million or an impressive 20.7% compared with last year\u2019s adjusted operating profit due to greater leverage of our operating cost because of higher sales volume and benefits from our previously announced streamlining actions, partially offset by higher employee-related costs including incentive compensation.","During the first quarter, we completed the closure of the two small production facilities which were part of the streamlining action initiated in the prior year. We did not incur any significant incremental expense during the second quarter associated with the closing of the facilities, and we estimate that we realized approximately $3.5 million of pre-tax savings associated with the streamlining activities this quarter. We still expect to realize total annualized savings of $15 million and believe we are currently at this full run rate. These savings should help offset important investments we are continuing to make to expand our product and solution portfolio and enhance our production, distribution and customer service and support capabilities.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 35% compared with 33.6% in the second quarter of last year. We estimate the effective tax rate for the fiscal year 2014 will be approximately 35.5% before any discrete items, and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year. ","Cash flow generated from operations for the first six months of fiscal year 2014 was $57.4 million compared with net cash used for operations of $0.3 million in the prior year period. This significant year-over-year improvement reflects higher net income, less cash used for working capital, and lower variable incentive compensation payments. ","Total operating working capital of 47 days at February 28, 2014 was essentially flat with the prior year. In the first half of fiscal year 2014, we spent $16.5 million on capital expenditures compared with $21.9 million in the prior year period. We currently expect to spend approximately $50 million in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2014. ","At February 28, 2014, we had a cash balance of $408.2 million, an increase of $49.1 million since the beginning of the fiscal year. Our total debt was $354 million; consequently, our cash exceeded debt at the end of the second quarter. At February 28, 2014, we had additional borrowing capacity of $243.8 million under our credit facility that does not mature until January 2017, so we continue to maintain a significant amount of financial flexibility. ","Thank you, and I\u2019ll turn the call back to Vern.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities well beyond just the current year. With regard to our expectation for the balance of 2014, our view has not changed over the last few quarters. We remain very positive. So while we don\u2019t give earnings guidance, I would like to reiterate what we\u2019ve mentioned over the last two quarters regarding our expectations for 2014.","First, most economists expect the economy in North America will continue to improve at a modest pace. While forecasts for industry growth rates by independent organizations continue to vary widely, the consensus estimate is that the broad lighting market in North America is expected to grow in the mid to upper single digit range for 2014. Further, we continue to see other signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve in our business. Leading indicators in the North American market such as the Architectural Building Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability, and the rebound in residential construction are all improving. As has become the norm over the last handful of years, we are always leery of the next round of uncertainty that might come out of Washington regarding fiscal issues as well as foreign policy. As you know, the manner and how these key issues are handled can meaningfully influence business and consumer confidence.","Nonetheless, we continue to expect that the overall demand in our end markets for 2014 will continue to improve and be more broad-based and consistent than experienced in 2013, though still with some volatility in demand among certain sales channels and geographies. The continued favorable trend in our order rate again seems to support this level of improvement.","Second, we do not anticipate significant changes in input costs for the balance of our 2014 as some commodity costs have waned while others continue to rise. Further, we expect employee-related costs to continue to rise due to wage inflation, the negative impact of rising healthcare costs, and higher incentive compensation due to our positive performance. Of course, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture as well as furthering our efforts to drive productivity improvements to help offset rising costs, as evidenced by the benefits realized in fiscal 2014 from streamlining actions we took in the second half of fiscal 2013. ","Next, while our gross profit margin is influenced by a number of factors, including sales volume as well as product and sales channel mix, we expect our gross profit margin to improve over time as volume grows, particularly for larger new construction projects, which should also benefit our mix, and as we continue to realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies. Also, we expect margins over the longer term to benefit from the sale of higher value-added integrated lighting solutions with differentiated features and benefits.","Additionally, we continue to experience some isolated pricing pressures in certain markets and sales channels such as home improvement and larger renovation projects. As we have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly, we expect to continue to meaningfully outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are very excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform. As we have noted in our last several conference calls, our strategies to drive profitable growth remain essentially the same. We continue to see opportunities in this environment, including benefits from growing portions of the market, further expansion in under-penetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the introduction of new lighting solutions. Our strong results reflect the solid execution of these strategies by our associates.","Our company-wide strategy is straightforward \u2013 expand and leverage our industry-leading product and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength, to capitalize on market growth opportunities that will provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns.","This all takes focus and resources. We are funding these activities today because we see great future opportunity. Through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market. As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade, particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential. As the North American market leader, we are uniquely positioned to full participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you, and with that we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question and Answer Session","","Operator","Thank you. [Operator instructions]","Our first question comes from Kathryn Thompson with Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions today. First is really more of a top line look. Obviously weather has been an impact in the quarter. In terms of looking at\u2014you said you feel like sales have been pushed out. What gives you conviction for that, and are you seeing any change in order trends today that supports your conviction that these sales are not lost but just pushed out?","Vernon Nagel","So Kathryn, if we look at our sales by geography, we see very robust growth in many of the geographies except for those that appear to have been impacted by the weather. Earlier in the quarter when the first storm rolled through, we didn\u2019t really expect much of an impact, but as the storms persisted, it became pretty evident from a channel perspective and a geography perspective that weather was having a pretty meaningful impact. As we look at our order rates now, we see in those geographies a return to what our view is a more normal rate.","To say that all of those sales will be made up in the third quarter, I think that would probably be inappropriate. I do believe that projects took delays, some of those with hard deadlines. People probably will work overtime to achieve those deadlines, but for the most part it should be made up over the next couple of quarters, would be my guess.","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Great. Along that line, a question that we get\u2014we\u2019ve been focusing on and have received frequently is just that of pricing conviction. To have one storm, as you said, you can shake it off; but when you have several weeks in a couple of months of just bad weather, sometimes there is a concern that pricing conviction can be tested. So could you comment in those weather-affected areas what pricing trends you got, and what type of pushback, if any, you received, most particularly in the weather affected areas in the quarter.","Vernon Nagel","So Ricky, I don\u2019t believe that we\u2019ve heard really any, if you will, issues or comments around the pricing side of things. For the most part, these would be particularly in the C&I channel, for example, where there are specific projects that were very project-oriented. Those would be orders that were already placed; they\u2019re just looking for the ability to have workers get to the jobsite and install those luminaires. If you look at the home improvement channel, you look at some of the stock and flow business \u2013 again, pricing is usually pretty consistent there, so it\u2019s really just how do you get the material there and are the people who are building projects and doing these things available to install. So I don\u2019t believe that the weather had any impact on pricing.","Pricing overall, as we said, was fairly benign this quarter. You know that most of our business is a bid business, so every day you\u2019re out there fighting for an order, and I don\u2019t believe that anything has materially changed in the pricing environment, weather related or non-weather related. ","Kathryn Thompson \u2013 Thompson Research Group","Okay, great. Thank you for taking my questions today.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is Jed Dorsheimer of Canaccord.","Josh Baribeau \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Hi, this is Josh Baribeau for Jed. Vern, can you talk about the channel a bit and how that\u2019s evolving with new technology? Some of your competitors, let\u2019s call them large and small, are attempting to bypass the traditional agent model. Are you seeing any loss in their leverage or how that channel works?","Vernon Nagel","I believe that the channels that we serve and the way we serve them, whether it be the C&I channel going through agents, or whether it\u2019s stock-and-flow with key distributor partners, I believe that our growth is reflective of the building strength of that channel; and sure, you\u2019re going to have folks who will attempt to go around channels because they just don\u2019t have strength there, and they\u2019ll get orders \u2013 there\u2019s no issue around that. But at the end of the day, I believe that the way the market wants to be served \u2013 so if you\u2019re a lighting designer, an architect, an engineer, a building owner, a contractor \u2013 you want to deal with those folks who can reliably bring you the breadth and depth of the kind of portfolio that Acuity as. ","As we get more and more into smart and simple lighting solutions, people want to deal with the folks who truly understand that, so lighting professionals that exist within our rep network are robust and add great value. I actually think as we get\u2014as we migrate more and more to technologically enhanced lighting solutions, you\u2019re going to see the agency model get even stronger and for those folks like Acuity become even stronger because of the breadth and depth of our knowledge and capability.","Josh Baribeau \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Great. And then how do we think about, or how are you thinking about international expansion and maybe how that compares to the growth of your\u2014the comments you\u2019ve made about the growth of your served markets growing by 50%? Is international included in any of that?","Vernon Nagel","Yes, we have over the last 18 months \u2013 Ricky? \u2013 24 months really kind of restructured our international organization to really become more narrow and deep. In fact, I\u2019m pleased to see that we saw some nice success this quarter in some of our international markets, but that narrow and deep opportunity for us to leverage our existing capabilities, both in Europe, South America and to a lesser degree in the Middle East and Asia, we think are good opportunities. We\u2019re looking at different ways to access that market more effectively, or those markets than we do today, and I think that the international space for us over the next handful of years will provide opportunities for growth.","Josh Baribeau \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","And just maybe a quick follow-up \u2013 any way you can quantify for us the percentage of business outside of North America at this point?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. Ricky, what\u2019s that number? It\u2019s between 2 and 3%?","Richard Reece","Yeah, it\u2019s less than 3% but it is growing, as Vern commented, particularly Europe is coming off of a very deep trough that it\u2019s been in. We\u2019ve seen some nice sequential as well as year-over-year growth there, but it\u2019s still a pretty minor percentage of our total sales.","Vernon Nagel","And to be clear, when we look at our leadership position in Canada, U.S. and Mexico, we believe that we\u2019re tied for that number one spot in Canada, clear number one player in the U.S., and clear number one player in Mexico, and we believe that these are growing markets and opportunities for us. So we\u2019ll leverage our knowledge of lighting solutions and leverage our portfolio into some of these international markets more aggressively, again over the next handful of years.","Josh Baribeau \u2013 Canaccord Genuity","Great, thanks. I\u2019ll pass it on. ","Operator","Thank you. The next question is Rich Kwas of Wells Fargo.","Rich Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo","Hi, good morning. Just a couple questions. Just back on that weather comment, so Vern, we should think of this as three points of lost revenues, and if we put a 20 or 25% incremental on that, we should think of it as kind of $0.04 or $0.05 of incremental headwind on top of the $0.09? Is that the right way to think about it?","Vernon Nagel","Yeah, we didn\u2019t really attempt to quantify the exact sales number because I think it would be, frankly, impossible to do that. We believe it was as much as 3%, to Kathryn\u2019s question earlier. That\u2019s not a bad number.","If you look at what our variable contribution has been, particularly this year given our outsized performance, so we have incentive comp going through there, 20% is not an unreasonable number. If you look at our variable contribution even with the unusual items, it was about 17%. Our bonus this year or in this quarter, there was virtually no bonus accrued in the year-ago quarter, so our variable contribution margin, if you take into account those three unusual items \u2013 not weather \u2013 that variable contribution margin was 27% even with the higher bonus. If you do it apples-to-apples, our variable contribution this quarter, taking into account those three unusual items and then removing bonus so you can truly see what the actual variable contribution off an incremental dollar sale, it was north of 35%, so very, very robust.","Obviously weather impacted our business both from a top line perspective and some inefficiencies, just expediting more over time, so on and so forth, we had a robust quarter, so we\u2019re just\u2014we\u2019re not really looking at weather as a huge issue. But your math makes sense to me.","Rich Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay. And then Ricky, on the warranty costs and the expedited freight, should we assume that these costs all hit this quarter? There\u2019s going to be nothing incremental moving forward in FQ3 and beyond?","Richard Reece","First on the warranty-related cost, that is an ongoing process, as we mentioned in the Q. You\u2019ll see a little a more disclosure in the Q, so we\u2019re not certain what the ultimate cost is. We are in discussions now with the government around this\u2014with the CPSC on this, so there could be some additional costs there, and they could be significant. We don\u2019t expect them to be, but they could be significant depending on how that plays out.","As far as the expedited freight, there we do believe we\u2019ve got countermeasures in place where that will not continue in any meaningful way going forward, not to say that we won\u2019t every now and then still have to expedite some components and all in, so there could be some but not to the degree we had this quarter, based on the countermeasures we put in place.","Vernon Nagel","This is Vern. Just a couple of quick points as well. On the accrual, we\u2019ve accrued our best estimate for what we believe\u2014what we know now vis-\u00e0-vis the design issue around that emergency product; and then with regard to the expediting cost, it\u2019s interesting. There were two real factors that influenced it. One, one supplier, their factory burned down, which is not a good thing, so we had to move quickly as part of our emergency response plan to a different vendor, so we incurred some expedited cost as a result of that. And then additionally, we had some products that just are extremely well received in the marketplace, so while we always put forth what our estimates are on future demand, we missed those expectations by meaningful amounts. So it\u2019s a good news story and a bad news story, as Ricky points out, but we believe that we have gotten our arms around the expediting issue as it relates to these couple of issues.","Rich Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, and then just one quick one \u2013 C&I, Vern, did you say C&I grew at the same rate as the corporate volume, or was it higher? I wasn\u2019t sure.","Vernon Nagel","It was essentially the same rate; and again, understand that in the C&I world, we had geographies that again we believe were impacted \u2013 we can see that in the numbers \u2013 by the severe weather conditions. Again, the Midwest and northeast are two examples of where weather did have an influence. So C&I was essentially, if you will, the overall growth average of 12.2%.","Rich Kwas \u2013 Wells Fargo","Okay, great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is Winnie Clark of UBS.","Winnie Clark \u2013 UBS","Good morning. You talked about the variable contribution margins and on an apples-to-apples basis being north of 35%. As we return to kind of a more normalized mix and as you\u2019re seeing new non-res construction orders come back, is that the type of contribution margin that we should be thinking about longer term?","Vernon Nagel","Well again, to be clear, we\u2019re trying to give folks a very good picture around what is influencing the variable contribution. Because of how we do our incentive comp, and it is strictly based on period-over-period improvement and if you hit the 50th percentile, we accrue at a rate, if you hit 75th percentile, it\u2019s obviously more, and then 95th percentile. We right now, based on our performance on a year-over-year basis on the three measures that we generally drive to, which is earnings, operating profit percentage, and cash flow, we\u2019re at well north of two times what our targets would be, so meaningful difference.","Assume next year in 2015 we have the same level of performance that we\u2019re having this year. You therefore would not see any period-over-period difference in the accrual for incentive comp, therefore what you would see is whatever that true variable contribution off the incremental sales dollar for the product is. Thirty-five percent is robust, and just to be clear about that, we\u2019ve worked very hard to drive productivity throughout our facilities. We\u2019ve taken streamlining actions that, as Ricky pointed out earlier, are benefiting our numbers, but I would say that 35% is probably on the high range or the high end of the range. We would want to be putting some of that incremental margin back into our business and in terms of additional headcount, additional capability, and we\u2019re doing that. So I think the number at 35% was at the upper end of what it would be normally.","Winnie Clark \u2013 UBS","Okay, thank you. That helps. And then just on the currency impact, can you talk a little bit about what your expectations are for that going forward? Should we expect there to be a continued headwind, potentially at least in the coming quarter?","Richard Reece","Yeah, it\u2019s obviously very, very difficult to predict currency movements, but we have seen the Canadian dollar stabilize a bit; in fact, come back a little bit, and again it seems to move pretty directly with energy, natural resource, commodity-type costs, so let\u2019s hope the Canadian dollar, given our portfolio or our profile, continues there. It\u2019s almost at parity now with the dollar. The Mexican peso also has not been too volatile over the last year, so those are the two primary currencies. As I say, we\u2019re long Canadian dollar, short peso, and have not chosen to really artificially hedge those since they typically naturally hedge. The European currencies have a little bit of impact on us, but not significant because we do manufacture in Europe, both in the U.K. and in the euro zone, and therefore have a more balanced cost-revenue profile in those regions. ","So it depends primarily on the Canadian dollar and the Mexican. Historically, those two have been a natural hedge for us. Our expectation going forward is that they will as well for the most part, and based on current movements in the last month since the end of our second quarter, they seem to be pretty benign right now.","Winnie Clark \u2013 UBS","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is Peter Lisnic of Robert W. Baird. ","Peter Lisnic \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Good morning gentlemen. Vern, on your comments on new construction coming back, can you give us a little feel for what that mix of business looks like nowadays, and what I mean by that is just are you seeing more higher value-add type of content today versus previous cycles? Just a view on as that business improves, what type of mix, if you will, we should be expecting to see.","Vernon Nagel","Peter, if you look at\u2014when you do all of the statistics around non-residential construction, particularly as it relates to new construction contrasting that with renovation, we are still way in the early, early stages of a rebound. I mean, when I look at the inflation adjusted numbers, we\u2019re still off 25% from what our peak was in 2008, and yet you have population in North America growing at roughly 2% per annum. So our view is that we\u2019re in these very stages.","Our expectation is that as new construction rebounds, you are going to see people procuring more and more of holistic lighting solutions, things that embed controls into luminaires, LED-based luminaires that then can be controlled as part of an energy\/building management capability. So people will be focusing on quality of light and the ability to take advantage of systems like our nLight system, systems controls to really drive better energy efficiency. So our expectation is that as new construction comes back, you will see people procuring, again, more holistic integrated solutions. We\u2019re just really in the early innings of that. ","We were encouraged by the order rate in a couple of our product lines that are really more generally tied to new construction, but what we also look at is the value of orders coming in, and we still really have not seen big jobs roll through like if you were to imagine in the 2007 \u2013 2008 time frame when there was a lot of new construction going on at that point in time. So it\u2019s still really too early to tell you precisely that we\u2019re seeing this and this is how the mix is. We can only tell you what we believe will happen.","Peter Lisnic \u2013 Robert W. Baird","But is it fair to say the uptake on some of those holistic lighting solutions is kind of in line with what you\u2019re thinking to give you the confidence to say going forward, we expect this to happen?","Vernon Nagel","Yes. ","Peter Lisnic \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay.","Vernon Nagel","You know, what\u2019s fascinating is in the old days when someone wanted to have dimming capability, it was very expensive, and so you saw it only in the very high-end type of applications. So K \u2013 12 schools, for example, couldn\u2019t afford really dimming capability. Today with products in our portfolio that Acuity has, and others, we\u2019re able to provide dimming capability which allows for energy savings while you\u2019re using the space. It\u2019s no longer that if you\u2019re in the space, turn the light on; if you\u2019re not, turn them off and that\u2019s how you get energy savings Today, we\u2019re able to offer a wide range of applications, energy savings, taking advantage of dimming, taking advantage of day lighting, to a much broader range of clients or customers, if you will, and application, and doing it in a way that it\u2019s a little bit more, if you will, expensive but the paybacks are quite significant and quite quick.","Peter Lisnic \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay, perfect. And then just a last follow-up \u2013 as you look at that uptake of the more holistic lighting solutions, is there any headway being made by what I\u2019d call non-traditional competitors \u2013 you know, competitors that you didn\u2019t necessarily deal with, call it previous cycle that now have a more broader product portfolio and are able to compete a little bit more effectively with you, or is it still confined to kind of the four majors and some other more niche players?","Vernon Nagel","Yeah. I would say that there are folks that are out there that were not participants in the market \u2013 and I\u2019d just pick 2008 \u2013 that are here today that have capability to offer certain types of solutions into certain types of applications, and we\u2019ll compete with them again on a feature and benefit basis. We believe that it\u2019s no longer just the system or the fixture\u2014systems are new, but the ability to really provide service and support, and for our end customers to have the confidence in a company like Acuity with its size and scale and its ability to serve really anywhere in North America very effectively. It\u2019s a huge advantage for us.","So you\u2019re going to see non-traditional players have sales and get a piece of the market, but when you think about the market as we define it today being roughly a $13 billion market having the potential over the next, you know, handful of years to go to $19 billion, and a lot of it is going to be because you\u2019re selling more value per square foot, I think that the leverage is with those folks who have the kind of market connectivity that is deep and very, very consistent. Others who are new entrants, some have big names, I think that they\u2019ll find it a challenge after they get past a few jobs that they may take.","Peter Lisnic \u2013 Robert W. Baird","Okay. All right, perfect. Thank you for the time and the insights.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. The next question is Mike Ritzenthaler of Piper Jaffray.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Yes, good morning everyone. Just one other follow-up, I guess, on the C&I channel. We have also (indiscernible) about that have seen an uptick in interest in that particular vertical, but one of the areas of pushback is which types of buildings are seeing that type of growth. I guess given your size and your view into multiple bids and projects, I know we\u2019re early but is there any wisdom that you can impart on where we should be looking for the pockets of strength within C&I, at least in this initial phase?","Vernon Nagel","Sure. You know, I think a good indicator for all of you would be to look at absorption of real estate space and look at, again, the end vertical applications \u2013 schools, office buildings, industrial spaces, roadway opportunities. Schools are still having a bit of a tough go because a lot of that is funding from local and state governments, but we\u2019re starting to see an uptick there. Commercial office buildings, the absorption both in urban centers and non-urban centers has really started to improve nicely, so we would expect that as vacancy rates continue to decline, you\u2019ll see people putting investment in there. Commercial office buildings has always been a traditional strength of Acuity, and that portion of the market has been soft over the last four years, so we have additional enthusiasm as that market comes back that our product portfolio, our solutions capability and our access to market will allow us to really capitalize on that. Industrial spaces, particularly on the renovation side, have been a good opportunity for us, so those would be some of the ones that I would mention as strengths going forward.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then just as a follow-up, with the LED growth continuing to be very impressive, a lot of us are trying to reconcile all the different moving parts this quarter with some of the different unusual items that you had backed out. As we\u2019re trying to reconcile LED growth with those items, one of the questions that comes up from time to time is on cannibalization. I wonder if you can just comment maybe qualitatively about as LED growth ramps, talking about slower growth in some of your more traditional lighting businesses and what that might look like in terms of results and margins over the next, I don\u2019t know, six or nine months.","Vernon Nagel","Excellent question. We actually don\u2019t look at our business that way. We look at our business as what are the end markets, the end vertical applications, and what\u2019s available to us; so in other words, if someone says I\u2019m going to build something, we go into that opportunity by saying, what is it that you are trying to do? What would you like to accomplish? Are you first cost, total cost of ownership, sustainability \u2013 I mean, the whole gamut of questions. So what we then do is make sure that we\u2019re providing a good-better-best option for that person who is trying to build that particular building. ","If it\u2019s a renovation project, similarly \u2013 what are you attempting to do? Because we sell from a full wagon. We\u2019re not selling from just one light source versus another. I mean, our OLED business is starting to show great growth, so again we\u2019re agnostic, if you will, to the light source, but very focused on the application.","So when we look at our growth or LED-based luminaires, it\u2019s really you that are most interested in that. We\u2019re excited about it because we think that it\u2019s allowing us to sell more holistic solutions that can offer more capability, but if you walk through our facilities, you\u2019re going to see one cell that\u2019s manufacturing a traditional fluorescent luminaire, and right next to it is an LED luminaire, and that afternoon they could switch. So we are focused on that end application.","I do believe that as we continue to migrate into the digital world, Acuity is uniquely positioned with its controls position, with its light engine component business to really bring together solutions into these end vertical applications like schools, industrial spaces that are truly smart and simple to use. So we think that gives us the opportunity to really over time improve our margins as we sell these types of value-add capabilities to those end customers.","Richard Reece","I would just reinforce we don\u2019t make lamps, we don\u2019t for the most part make ballast, we don\u2019t make LED chips, so it\u2019s not as if we\u2019re going to be sitting with stranded assets as the technology moves from lamp and ballast to LED, or even as the LED chips continue to evolve and you go to different types of manufacturing and all of that. We\u2019re an integrator, assembler, a designer and so forth, so as Vern commented we, unlike some of the more vertically integrated companies, don\u2019t have the stranded asset issue as this technology continues to evolve.","Mike Ritzenthaler \u2013 Piper Jaffray","Excellent. Thanks for all your help.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Glen Wortman of Sidoti.","Glen Wortman \u2013 Sidoti","Yeah, good morning everyone. Looking at SG&A, just based on some of your previous commentary around the fixed component and then variable costs, it does look like your SG&A came in lower than I would have expected. Should I read anything into that, and how should we be thinking about SG&A going forward?","Vernon Nagel","So again, as we have stated in the past, if you go back over the last six quarters, our freight and commission as a percentage of sales has been in a pretty tight range \u2013 around 11.5 to 11.6%. If I look at our fixed SDA, more interestingly if I back out bonus \u2013 and I\u2019m not suggesting you do that \u2013 but if I back out bonus, this quarter was pretty consistent, by the way, with where we have been, kind of roughly in that $90 million range. This quarter was a little less \u2013 it was 88, but bonus obviously was the difference in that fixed piece, so you get a sense there.","But my two cents on it is I would look at fixed excluding bonus to be probably in the $90 million range, and then bonus, it depends on how well we do. We\u2019re hoping to accrue a huge bonus this year, so. If you add back the bonus and you look at this quarter, we were at about $93.5 million on the fixed. Previous first quarter we were at about 94.5, so again all pretty tight in that range of around 95 in total. I think that\u2019s probably a decent number.","And understand that in what we are calling fixed, they are still variable pieces in there. I mean, when we have trade shows that we go to, it\u2019s that period where we accrue that cost, so Light Fair is coming up, so in the third quarter typically\u2014Light Fair is always in the third quarter, so typically we\u2019ll have a little higher cost associated with that. But I think for modeling purposes, we\u2019re not uncomfortable with kind of that mid-90 million number.","Glen Wortman \u2013 Sidoti","Okay, and then just walk us through the balance sheet. You\u2019re in a net cash position. Can you just update us on your cash priorities?","Richard Reece","Sure. Our first priority is obviously to invest in the business, and we\u2019re doing that. We\u2019ve got $50 million of capital expenditure estimate for this year as we continue to invest in new products, in new capabilities and IT, as well as productivity opportunities, cost reduction opportunities, and so forth. M&A would probably then come next as a priority. We\u2019ve been fairly acquisitive throughout the last six, seven years, and would continue to do that. And when you look over the last six years or so, five, six years, you\u2019ll see about half of our free cash flow we spend on M&A and organic growth through CAPEX, which is not dissimilar actually from peer companies as well as other manufacturing companies. ","The other 50% of cash flow, we\u2019ve returned to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, and would expect to continue somewhere in that range. We do have a consistent dividend we\u2019ve been paying. We look at that as a\u2014the board looks at that periodically and evaluates that, and then we do have authorization for another $2 million share repurchase that we will opportunistically use, based on potential other uses of the cash flow; and as I said, over the last five years, dividends and share repurchases have resulted in about half of our free cash flow being returned to the shareholders.","Vernon Nagel","And Ricky, I would also point out we are very focused on acquisitions, but the problem is that\u2014I call it the two D\u2019s. A deal has to be both doable as well as desirable, so we continue to look for opportunities. eldoLAB and Adura are great examples of what we\u2019re attempting to do.","The other point I would make \u2013 you know, our cash flow return on investment on the trailing 12 months is now in the kind of upper 20\u2019s in terms of percentage, so we continue to deliver very strong cash flow return on investment and we\u2019re generating good cash.","Glen Wortman \u2013 Sidoti","Okay, thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from Matt McCall of BB&T Capital Markets.","Matt McCall \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Thank you. Good morning everybody. Vern, you mentioned in\u2014I think it was you, might have been Ricky, investments to vertically integrate your fixtures and controls. Are those manufacturing investments, are those front-end investments in SG&A? I\u2019m just wondering if they are showing up fully in OPEX or CAPEX, or we\u2019re going to see incremental spending from here.","Vernon Nagel","So our CAPEX\u2014well, the simple answer to your question is it\u2019s human capital primarily, but we are investing capital at capital investments at about 1.5% to 2%. So as Ricky pointed out earlier, we are upgrading or upticking some of our CAPEX to really expand our eldoLED driver capability because they have unique features and capabilities that we want to make available to the entire marketplace, so we\u2019re upticking investing to handle that capacity.","The second issue or opportunity is headcount. You have seen our fixed SDA, or that portion that we call fixed increase over the last three years, four years, because we have been investing in people. Our productivity, our sales per person continues to improve very, very nicely, so SDA\u2014we will get leverage off of that, and you saw it this quarter. We picked up 100 BPs even though our bonus this quarter was significant compared to the de minimis amount that was in the year-ago period. So we are adding people, but we\u2019re doing that in a way that is consistent with leveraging our SDA to the top line. ","The kind of growth that we\u2019re getting on the top line requires service and support, but let\u2019s be clear \u2013 our variable contribution margin is improving and the fact is that we\u2019re growing very aggressively because of how we\u2019ve proliferated our lighting solutions portfolio, which includes luminaires, controls and components. That\u2019s due to the acquisitions and the investments that we\u2019ve made over the last x-years. ","I actually believe that for folks that are doing modeling purposes, one of the longer term things that they have to do is look at what our sales per headcount is, and if you go back to 2005 it was $200,000 of revenues per head. Last year it was $325,000 revenue per head, so we\u2019re continuing to drive productivity throughout our business and getting leverage both at the gross profit side as well as the SDA side.","Matt McCall \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, thank you Vern. The last question \u2013 this is kind of a follow-up to an earlier one, but when you look at how your business is trending this cycle from a kind of all-in spend per square foot when you bring in controls and components and the items that you were talking about, as you\u2019ve looked at that on kind of a per-project basis, be it a new building or a remodel or retrofit, what can it tell you about this success? You talked a lot about the bigger market opportunity, but what is your actual data telling you about the all-in spend per square foot, and what does it tell you it could look like as we move through the cycle versus the last cycle?","Vernon Nagel","So again, for new construction we\u2019re very early in this game; but if you look at renovation, on average \u2013 and again, it varies so widely in terms of what type of end market application. If you\u2019re in the industrial space, you\u2019re going to have a number. If you\u2019re\u2014you know, an office like yours is going to be a much higher number. We kind of guesstimate that the install base \u2013 100 billion square feet \u2013 to renovate that for luminaires is probably $3 a square foot, and then you add another $0.50 or so a square foot for controls. That\u2019s a $300 billion to $350 billion market install base that will renovate. But it varies so widely, it\u2019s very difficult for us to precisely say, and truthfully we really don\u2019t track it that way. What we\u2019re looking at is how do you win a job, and then what are our margins on that job.","Matt McCall \u2013 BB&T Capital Markets","Okay, that\u2019s fair. Thank you, Vern.","Operator","Thank you. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vernon Nagel","Thank you for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies, and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will over the longer term deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright. Thank you for your support. ","Operator","Thank you for your participation. That does conclude today\u2019s conference.

[Operator Instructions] Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time. Now I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","C. Dan Smith","Thank you, and good morning. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2013 first quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today's conference call at www.acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the company. Such statements involve risk and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings and today's press release, which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now let me turn the call over to Vern.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments, and then we'd be happy to answer your questions.","Overall, our results for the first quarter of fiscal 2013 were influenced by what we believe was a lull in demand in the nonresidential construction market and higher spending primarily related to temporary inefficiencies associated with the closing of our Cochran, Georgia manufacturing facility.","Overall, we are pleased with our results for the first quarter, particularly given the challenging market conditions and the complexities associated with the Cochran closure. With that said, we feel we delivered solid results while achieving success on numerous strategic priorities.","As independent market data is becoming available, it is confirming that the potential economic slowdown we discussed in our previous filings and calls became a reality during the quarter. The result this quarter was inconsistent demand.","In spite of the slowdown, this was the 11th quarter in a row where we achieved volume growth. I believe this is, yet again, positive evidence our strategy to diversify the end markets we serve and extend our leadership position in North America is succeeding. These strategies include the continued aggressive introduction of innovative, energy-efficient lighting solutions; expansion in key channels and geographies; and improvements in customer service and productivity.","We would like to be very clear about our continued expectations for our performance in 2013. For us, nothing has really changed. We expect to continue to outperform the markets we serve and to deliver full year results more consistent with our long-term financial goals as noted in our 10-K. Remember, these goals represent upper quartile performance.","As we discussed on our fourth quarter call, we anticipated inconsistency in demand this quarter, and we expect that to continue through our second quarter and potentially longer. Nonetheless, we remain positive about our long-term opportunities to extend our market leadership position, while delivering superior value for our customers and returns for our shareholders.","I know many of you have already seen our results, and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the quarter.","Net sales for the quarter were $481 million, an increase of 1.4% compared with the year-ago period. This level of growth is meaningful given general economic and industry conditions, as I noted above.","Reported operating profit was $48.2 million. We took a special charge in the current quarter for previously announced streamlining actions and incurred temporary inefficiencies associated with these actions, which, in total, reduced operating profit by $5.5 million.","The year-ago period also had streamlining charges for other activities. Ricky will talk more about these special charges and these temporary inefficiencies associated with the Cochran closure later in the call.","We find it helpful to add back these items to both quarters' results to make them comparable. Doing so, one can see adjusted operating profit was $53.7 million, consistent with the year-ago period, while adjusted operating profit margin was 11.2%, also consistent with the year-ago period.","Diluted earnings per share were $0.61. Again, adding back the impact of the items noted above in both quarters, adjusted diluted EPS for the current quarter was $0.69 compared with $0.74 in the year-ago period.","As Ricky will explain later, fluctuations in foreign currency had no material impact on our diluted EPS this quarter, while it benefited EPS in the year-ago period by $0.04. You can do your own math to get a true apples-to-apples comparison between quarters from an EPS perspective when eliminating the impact of these currency fluctuations. As you would expect, similar with the operating profit, we were essentially flat with the year-ago period.","There are number of key items to note regarding the results in the first quarter. Net sales grew 1.4% compared with the year ago. However, unit volume grew almost 2% this quarter. This growth was partially offset by a slight shift in the mix of products sold. The impact of acquisitions and foreign currency on net sales was not significant.","The increase in net sales was impacted by tepid demand in the nonresidential construction market, reflecting what we believe was a wait-and-see approach by customers to the resolution of the fiscal cliff situation and government funding availability. From a product perspective, the increase was reasonably broad-based along many product lines, partially offset by declines in certain channels. These declines were caused by delays of projects in certain channels, including retail renovation and municipal expansion due to the factors I just mentioned.","Growth in our largest channel, commercial and industrial, was above this quarter's average due to the continued emphasis on selling higher value-added lighting solutions, especially LED-based luminaires, which again grew by more than 2.5x compared with the year-ago period, as well as the continued focus on smaller and medium-sized projects of various types. Additionally, we enjoyed growth in our residential products, as demand for new housing and renovation of existing homes continued to rebound, helping to offset some of the softness in the nonresidential market. We continue to experience growth in certain geographies and channels in North America, as well as key markets internationally, all of which is encouraging.","As we have noted before, it is impossible to precisely determine the separate impact that price and product mix changes have in our net sales. Having said that, we estimate the negative impact on sales from price mix was primarily due to a slight shift in the mix of products sold principally among certain channels.","While there were puts and takes on both the product pricing and material and component cost fronts, we believe that both were fairly benign this quarter.","Looking at all this a bit more closely, there are some interesting points to note. We believe spending in key segments of the U.S. nonresidential construction market was relatively flat in the quarter compared with a year ago. Further, we believe the overall lighting market was up slightly during the same period, supported by modest growth in the residential market. This is consistent with our unit volume growth in North America, which was up more than 2%.","We believe our channel and product diversification, as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative lighting solutions, and the strength of our many sales force has allowed us to achieve volume growth this quarter in spite of these challenging market conditions.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on our profitability and strategic accomplishments in the quarter.","Excluding the impact of the special charge and the temporary inefficiencies associated with the plant consolidation, adjusted operating profit margin for the fourth -- for the first quarter was a solid 11.2%, consistent with the year-ago period. This is particularly notable given that sales of LED-based luminaires now make up more than 13% of our net sales.","Further, as Ricky will discuss later in the call, adjusted gross profit margin was 40.4%, down about 40 basis points from the prior year. We believe the decline was due primarily to the slight shifts in the mix of products sold, along with continued spending for new products, partially offset by lower material and component cost, as well as modest productivity improvements associated with our ongoing streamlining activities.","In our view, much of the increased spending is primarily due to the acceleration of new product launches, which include startup costs and inefficiencies we normally experience in the early phases of new product introductions.","While our gross profit margin is highly dependent on unit volume and the mix of products sold, we expect our gross profit margins to improve, as volume grows and as we realize typical gains in manufacturing efficiencies, as well as more cost-effective launches for new products.","The 40 basis point decline in gross profit margin was offset by a similar improvement in selling, distribution, administrative expenses, which were 29.2% of net sales in the quarter.","Total SD&A expenses were essentially flat this quarter compared with the year-ago period. Lower incentive compensation expense and productivity improvements helped to offset other increases in SD&A expenses, which were primarily related to activities focused on longer-term growth opportunities, including market diversification and investing in innovation and technology, primarily for solid-state luminaires and integrated intelligent lighting systems.","Investments in these key areas are starting to pay off, as our new products and solutions gain traction in the marketplace driving revenue growth. As a point of reference, we have noted in previous earnings calls, we expect SD&A expenses, excluding freight and commissions, based on our current structure to fluctuate a few million dollars or so around the mid-point of $88 million.","On a strategic front, we continued our rapid pace of introductions of new products, significantly expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions.","As I mentioned earlier, our solid-state lighting portfolio is expanding rapidly, as are the sales of these luminaires. Today, LED-based products are now more than 13% of our sales, and we continue to fund the development of other light source technologies, such as organic LEDs, where we continue to expand our award-winning portfolio of these innovative products.","More impressively, as I noted earlier, our adjusted operating profit margin continued to remain solid, while sales of LED-based solutions have become a larger portion of our overall business.","Acuity is a clear leader in digital lighting solutions. It is because we understand lighting and the sophisticated needs of our expansive customer base and are able to offer each tailored solutions from our industry-leading portfolio.","Customers understand it takes more than just an LED chip, which is quickly becoming a commodity, or a fluorescent lamp to be a true lighting company like Acuity Brands.","At Acuity, we offer customers superior quality lighting and energy-efficient solutions for virtually every indoor and outdoor application regardless of the light source. This is again why we are extending our leadership position.","As I have noted before, our organization has a long and distinguished history of leading and innovating during eras of technology disruption. Today is clearly no different.","Acuity Brands is leading the evolution to intelligent lighting solutions with its broad and deep portfolio of indoor and outdoor solid-state and traditional energy-efficient luminaires and lighting controls, and we are delivering profitable growth and strong financial returns for our shareholders while making these investments. Our customers continue to recognize the fulsomeness of our capabilities as we won a number of awards for Vendor of the Year.","Our success with customers is driven by excellent service, breadth of product portfolio and the ability to incorporate the best technology to provide superior lighting solutions that best meet the needs for virtually any indoor or outdoor application. These accomplishments have diversified and strengthened our foundation and we believe will further service a robust platform for our future growth that is less reliant on the new commercial construction cycle.","We have been able to produce these results because of the dedication and resolve of our 6,000 associates. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2013. Ricky?","Richard K. Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning, everyone. I will highlight a few items regarding our income statement, including the special charge and production inefficiencies related to our streamlining activities. I then will discuss our cash flow and financial condition before turning the call back to Vern.","Vern covered the primary drivers for our sales growth and our profitability, so I will not repeat these items, but I would like to provide a bit more color on certain aspects of our first quarter results.","Let's first look at our streamlining activities. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we recognized a pretax special charge and temporary expenses related to the previously announced streamlining actions totaling $5.5 million or $0.08 per diluted share. The pretax special charge was $0.7 million or $0.01 per diluted share, and related primarily to the costs associated with the transfer of production due to the closure of the Cochran, Georgia facility.","In addition to this special charge, we incurred $4.8 million of higher pretax cost or $0.07 per diluted share related to temporary manufacturing inefficiencies associated with the closing of this facility, consisting primarily of nonproductive operating cost at the Cochran facility, which should cease when the plant is closed during our second quarter, expenses associated with the initial setup of production at various facilities that have accepted the production of products previously manufactured at the Cochran facility, and incremental costs associated with production-related activities temporarily performed by third parties that are now largely executed internally as our manufacturing capacity has recently been increased to accommodate the transfer of production.","As Vern said earlier, we find it useful to adjust our results for these items to make them more comparable, and we have included in our earnings release a full reconciliation of our GAAP amounts to these adjusted results.","The closure of the Cochran facility began in the third quarter of fiscal 2012. And as we mentioned previously in our 10-K and prior earnings conference calls, the timing of completing the transfer and closing the facility was dependent on how quickly we could receive the necessary government permits and approvals. Due primarily to delays in receiving the necessary government permits and approval, it has taken longer to complete and has cost more than we originally expected. We now expect to be principally completed with the closure by the end of the second quarter of fiscal year 2013. We expect to record an additional pretax special charge and temporary production inefficiencies of approximately $4 million associated with this closure, which will be recognized primarily during the second quarter of fiscal 2013.","If we have no further delays in receiving government permits and approvals or in ramping up production in the receiving facilities, we currently expect, after the second quarter, the Cochran facility will totally cease production and we will not incur any more special charges or manufacturing inefficiencies related to this streamlining effort.","Annualized pretax savings associated with this closure are still estimated to be approximately $8 million. But due to the delays in completing the transfer of production and closure of the facility, the full realization of the savings has been pushed out and are now expected to be fully realized by the beginning of our third fiscal quarter.","You may recall, in addition to the streamlining activities for the Cochran closing, we also had other streamlining efforts in fiscal year 2012, which are expected to yield annualized savings of roughly $6 million. Therefore, we estimate that these streamlining actions, in total, will generate annualized pretax savings of approximately $14 million or $3.5 million per quarter, of which approximately $1 million was realized in each of our second and third quarters of fiscal 2012 and approximately $2 million in each of our fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 and first quarter of fiscal 2013. We hope to be at the full quarterly savings rate of $3.5 million for all of these actions at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2013.","As Vern mentioned earlier, our adjusted gross margin decreased 40 basis points to 40.4% due largely to a slight shift in the mix of products sold and increased expenses associated with the large number of new product introductions and higher manufacturing costs related to other product mix changes.","These higher costs were partially offset by the favorable impact of increased net sales, lower material and component cost and realized benefits from the previously mentioned streamlining actions.","Let's next turn our attention to some of our results below the operating earnings line. Miscellaneous expense is due primarily to the impact of exchange rates on foreign currency, primarily Mexico peso-denominated items. In the first quarter of fiscal 2013, we had miscellaneous expense of $0.1 million compared with miscellaneous income of $2.9 million or $0.04 per diluted share in the prior year period. As Vern mentioned earlier, if you exclude this unfavorable comparison, our diluted EPS this quarter was essentially flat with the prior year period.","The effective tax rate this quarter was 35.4%. This is 70 basis points higher than the prior year quarter. This higher effective tax rate negatively impacted diluted EPS by $0.01 compared with the prior year period. The effective tax rate for the prior year period was favorably impacted by various discrete items, including the research and development tax credit, which did not occur in the first quarter of fiscal 2013.","Subsequent to our first quarter, the U.S. government has reinstated the R&D tax credit effective back to January 1, 2012. We will reflect the catch-up impact of this tax benefit in our second quarter of fiscal 2013, and we estimate the favorable impact to be approximately $0.6 million or $0.01 per diluted share, and it will lower our estimated effective tax rate for fiscal 2013 to slightly below 35%.","Now let's look at the cash flow for the quarter ended November 30, 2012. Cash flow used for operations for the first quarter of fiscal year 2012 was $14.5 million. Our first quarter is usually our weakest cash flow quarter due to seasonality and payment of prior fiscal year's incentive compensation. This year, we had higher payment of accounts payable related to inventory purchases made late in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2012 in order to maintain service levels during the production moves associated with our closure of the Cochran plant and certain strategic purchases of commodities and components.","We had expected to bring down these inventories during the first quarter of fiscal 2013. But primarily due to the previously mentioned delays in the Cochran production transfer, we did not reduce the inventories as quickly as originally planned.","In the first quarter of fiscal year 2013, we spent $11.2 million on capital expenditures compared with only $4.2 million in the prior year period. This increase in expenditures is largely related to the capital associated with adding capacity in the plants, receiving the production transfer from Cochran and tooling associated with the large number of new products recently developed.","Including our first quarter CapEx spend, we currently expect to spend approximately $40 million in capital expenditures for fiscal year 2013.","At November 30, 2012, we had a cash balance of $267.5 million and total debt of $353.5 million. At the end of the first quarter of fiscal 2013, net debt to total capitalization was a mere 9%. At November 30, 2012, we had additional borrowing capacity of $244.3 million under our credit facility that does not mature until January 2017. So we continue to maintain a significant amount of financial flexibility.","Thank you. And I'll now turn the call back to Vern.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. As we look forward, we see significant long-term growth opportunities, while short-term economic challenges are still the norm. While we don't give earnings guidance, I would like to add a few more observations to what I mentioned earlier regarding our expectations for the balance of 2013.","First, we expect the economic environment to continue to be challenging, as businesses and consumers in the U.S. begin to adjust their spending patterns based on the new tax laws just passed, as well as continuing to hone their plans to manage through the lingering uncertainties over U.S. policy reforms to address the nation's budget deficits, as well as other global economic concerns.","The consequence of these uncertainties, in our view, will continue to be volatility in demand. Forecasts by independent organizations for industry growth continue to vary widely. The consensus is that unit volume growth for key segments of the nonresidential construction market in the U.S. will still be in the lower mid-single digits in 2013, while sales for lighting fixtures are expected to be modestly higher supported by a growing residential market. This suggests that expected growth in the broad lighting market in North America will still be in the low- to mid-single-digit range for our fiscal 2013. This is reasonably consistent with the outlook in our previous filings.","Additionally, there are other signs that give us optimism regarding the future growth of our business. Leading indicators such as Architecture Billings Index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and the rebound in the residential construction market are all favorable. Therefore, our expectations for fiscal 2013 is that over demand -- overall demand will be favorable. However, while we are seeing favorable trends in our order rate so far in the second quarter, we still expect to see inconsistent conditions this quarter. Additionally, we expect European economies to remain weak, particularly Spain, for the foreseeable future.","While we still see wide variability in demand amongst channels, reflecting the tepid economic recovery in the U.S., we expect this inconsistency in demand to yield to more consistent and positive growth in the latter half of our fiscal year.","Second, the industry continues to experience volatility with respect to input costs. While some commodity costs have waned recently, others continue to rise. As of now, we expect material input cost to be relatively flat except for certain LED components, which should continue to decline.","Further, we expect employee-related cost will rise due to wage inflation and the negative impact of Obamacare on health care cost. Of course, we will continue to be vigilant in our pricing posture and productivity efforts to help offset rising cost. Additionally, as I have said before, we will defend our market position vigorously from competitors should they attempt to use price as their only point of differentiation.","Lastly, we expect to outperform the markets we serve. Looking more specifically at our company, we are excited by the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform.","As I noted in our last several calls, our strategies to drive profitable growth remain intact. We continue to see opportunities in this environment, including benefits from growing portions of market, further expansion in underpenetrated geographies and channels, and growth from the introduction of new lighting solutions.","As the industry leader in North America, we believe we are uniquely positioned with key suppliers around the globe to bring greater value and more differentiated value to our customers, incorporating advanced technologies, providing superior lighting quality and more sustainable energy solutions. Our product and solutions portfolios continue to expand rapidly, including the addition of 5 strategic acquisitions over the last few years, and we're adding more.","Yesterday, we announced the acquisition of Adura Technologies, the leading provider of wireless lighting controls and energy management systems. The acquisition of Adura, while small today in terms of revenues, is a meaningful addition to our growing portfolio of wireless lighting solutions, an area of significant focus and growth potential for Acuity and its customers.","Our strategy is straightforward. Expand and leverage our industry-leading product portfolio and solutions portfolio, coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities. This all takes focus and resources.","We are funding these activities today because we see great future opportunity. Though these investments -- through these investments, we have significantly expanded our addressable market.","As I have said before, we believe the lighting and lighting-related industry will experience significant growth over the next decade particularly as energy and environmental concerns come to the forefront. We continue to believe the many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting industry could grow by more than 50% over the next few years, providing us with significant growth potential. As the market leader, we are positioned well to fully participate in this exciting industry.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Jed Dorsheimer from Canaccord.","Jonathan Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Vern, in your prepared remarks earlier, you mentioned that operating margins were held up as a function of higher LED sales. One, I just wanted to confirm that. And then two, in the past, you've said that LED is neutral from a gross margin. Could you confirm that it's neutral to, I guess, accretive at this point, to operating margin?","Vernon J. Nagel","Jed, on your first point, what we were mentioning was that our margins remained consistent at 11.2% this period compared to the year-ago period, while our LED sales were up by more than 2.5x. For us, we believe that's an affirmation that as we continue to see the migration to more and more LED sales, that it does not have a dilutive effect, as was concern or a concern by many before. So I think it's very positive that we were able to maintain our operating profit margin at 11.2%, while seeing a meaningful increase in our overall LED sales. My own view about the future of LED luminaire sales and their ability to be accretive to our earnings is that as we continue to tie more and more lighting control around these LED luminaires and we sell more holistic integrated lighting systems, we're going to be able to sell more value per square foot. One of our key product lines, very small today, is our nLight System. We're seeing it growing very dramatically as the industry, as consumers find the use, simple to use, fantastic energy savings and great lighting control as an alternative to some of the traditional systems that are out there. So we continue to be optimistic that LED lighting and LED control systems will be accretive to our margins in the future.","Jonathan Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","And then I was wondering if we looked at C&I and sort of further segment it into individual sectors within that group, if you will, from a quoting activity or a level of interest, could you single out any particular sector, i.e. hospitality or retail, for example, that you're seeing the most activity, I guess, both maybe from a renovation and then also from a new build perspective?","Vernon J. Nagel","Sure. So Jed, early on, I think that the industry, where LED has had the most, if you will, transformation or most penetration, you're seeing that in easy-to-use items, outdoor, parking garages, certain difficult service-type environments on the indoor side. You've really yet to see the full penetration in commercial indoor spaces. We are way early in the game in terms of schools, commercial office buildings, health care facilities. As these price points and as these integrated solutions become more and more at the forefront, interest is starting to really ramp up. So we're very excited because we've really yet to see the true opportunities of what LED and again, integrated lighting systems can be on a go-forward basis. So to me...","Jonathan Dorsheimer - Canaccord Genuity, Research Division","Vern, I actually -- sorry, I just meant in the traditional business, so in your overall business, I know you have hundreds of thousands of SKUs. Is there a particular segment of the market that you're seeing the most demand? Could you further clarify sort of where demand is right now and where maybe quoting or interest is coming from, or is it just too broad-based?","Vernon J. Nagel","No, it's a good question. I can answer that. It's more on the small and medium-sized projects. We know that there are certain areas of the municipal markets that are actually down. Schools are still very difficult in this current environment, as municipalities look for funding. Health care seems to be kind of ebbing and flowing here. The commercial office space is still yet to take off. So our demand is relatively broad-based, but still reflective, in our view, of the tepid economic environment that's out there. When we look forward and you look at some of the leading indicators, and there are many that are out there, you can pick and choose the ones that you want, but commercial office space, as absorption continues to improve, as employment continues to improve, we're starting to see -- if you look at the Dodge's Momentum Index, these things are finally starting to just turn positive and usually, there's a lag to that. So a lot of the quote activity that we have out there is around these future opportunities, particularly around the commercial office space, industrial space, even some of the outdoor opportunities where municipalities have delayed spending, there's a lot quote activity that's out there that we expect will yield or turn into orders really in 2013, calendar year 2013.","Operator","Our next question comes from Peter Lisnic from Robert W. Baird.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Vern, I guess, can you give us a little bit of color or clarity on the mix comment? It sounds like that was the driver or offset volume in the quarter. I'm just wondering, was that more of a channel, a change in channel during the quarter? Or was there more product there that caused that mix to be negative in the quarter?","Vernon J. Nagel","And so, Pete, it would really be a combination of both. Let's first take the channel cut. The fact of the matter is, is that on the good news side, C&I was a little bit more as a percentage of our total. On the bad news side, a little bit of that channel mix was more driven by stock and flow. We tend to see a little bit higher margins on larger projects. So that mix had a little bit of an impact. We improved margins in our retail and catalog business. But yet, those, overall, were relatively flat. Some of that was offset by large infrastructure-type projects where, again, municipalities -- or those types of projects that are reliant on government funding were also taking a wait-and-see approach. We saw some minor cancellations, but what we believe was more delays in these types of projects. We also saw a little bit of mix shift into certain areas of our business, where again, our margins are just a little bit different, influencing our margins down slightly.","Peter Lisnic - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division","Okay, all right. That's helpful. The second question, if I could, is if price being a relative neutral in the quarter, I'm just wondering if you could bifurcate that -- and I know it's going to be difficult, but if you could bifurcate that between the LED product and the non-LED, with really a focus on the non-LED. I'm just wondering what this migration to LED, if you're seeing any sort of -- I don't know if significant is that right word, but just price pressure on non-LED products as you kind of move toward LED?","Vernon J. Nagel","So Pete, again, overall, we felt pricing was reasonably benign. But as you know, everything is local, everything is specific to the channel and the geography that they're in. So we gave you the overall feeling. My own $0.02 is, is that in the non-LED side, probably in terms of some of the lower end and the good\/better\/best value proposition, some of that lower end continues to be maybe a bit more price competitive. But where we have the ability to differentiate features and benefits and value, typically, you see more stable pricing there. So I don't know if there's any macro trend that we could provide to you that would be different than saying that overall pricing was benign for us in the quarter.","Operator","Our next question comes from Matt McCall from BB&T Capital Markets.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","So the -- let's start with the gross margin. So, I guess, several items to adjust for. I'm just trying to understand, Ricky, you talked about hitting your run rate, I think, at the beginning of your Q3 from a savings perspective. Should we expect any incremental in Q2? And then, anything we should keep in mind from a mix perspective, the incremental margin, price cost? Just trying to understand the puts and the takes there from the starting point of this 40.4% in Q1.","Richard K. Reece","Sure, Matt. First, on the streamline savings. The additional, call it, $1.5 million a quarter out there opportunity will mostly be at the gross margin line. That's when we are able to get the savings from the shutdown of the Cochran facility and the added volume absorption into the existing facilities. And yes, I would expect to see some improvement in our second quarter relative to the first as we ramp up to hopefully begin the third quarter at that full $3.5 million a quarter rate. So we should see some benefit throughout the second quarter. Again, dependent on the timing of getting these governmental permits and approvals, that's been a frustrater for us, and then trying to get these approvals so that we can more quickly move certain aspects of the production into the facilities and the inefficiencies that are incumbent when we don't have those facilities up to where we need them to be. But assuming we get all that on tack, you should see some improvement throughout the second quarter, and then we would hope to be at that full rate in the beginning of the third quarter.","Vernon J. Nagel","And Matt, this is Vern. Our team has done an outstanding job in transitioning from the Cochran facility to other facilities. The delays and permits are like taking a wrench and throwing it through a jet engine. And yet, our team has done really an outstanding job of managing that process. The hidden cost of that is that while you are focusing maniacally on trying to make sure that you can paint things, even though you don't have your paint permits, so you're now outsourcing that, we have identified that as inefficiencies associated with Cochran, but it also takes away from our continuous improvement efforts. I'd like everyone to understand, we are maniacally focused as an organization on continually driving improvements in our business to reduce cost so we can continue to invest. When you have challenges like the complexity of the Cochran close, which is a great thing for us to do, it tends to also have some leakage in other areas. So as Ricky points out, going forward, we would expect to continue to drive improvement. The mix and its impact on our current quarter, I mean, truthfully, it's impossible for us to manage quarter-to-quarter the mix. And we don't try to. We try to serve our customers as best we can. So there's some noise in that, and there always will be. I mean, as I said earlier, our gross profit margins are really contingent upon volume and the mix of products sold. And our company will always be focused on continuing to drive cost out of all of our processes and it's -- while we put out a bogey[ph] in the goal, it's impossible to, from one quarter to the next, completely predict that.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","And then, on the SG&A line, your commentary in the past, I'm thinking you mentioned it again here, $88 million, plus or minus, and I think I've used a little more than 11% on the variable component for freight and commissions. But if I run those numbers -- or put those numbers into the Q1 SG&A or SD&A, it comes up a little higher. And I guess my question, you said that you're starting to see some payoff was -- maybe can you talk a little bit more about the payoff you're starting to see? And was that it? Or did you curve some spending or do something else to reduce that line item relative to what you're seeing on the top line?","Vernon J. Nagel","So Matt, I think if you use maybe more like an 11.3%, 11.4%, what you'll probably come up with is about $55 million, $54 million for freight and commissions and probably roughly $86 million for SD&A. And that is within, if you will, the tolerance of a few million dollars either side of the $88 million that we feel is a current run rate. And again, the variability depends on things like product samples, product introductions, T&E, certain marketing expenses. But obviously, there are salaries in there and things of that nature. Again, a lot of our streamlining activities are to help us continue to offset wage inflation, health care cost, things of that nature. So again, I think that the SD&A was managed well during the quarter. And I think when you do your math, you'll probably come up with something like that. I did that off the top of my head.","Matthew Schon McCall - BB&T Capital Markets, Research Division","No, that is correct math. I was just more referencing to starting to pay off reference. You said starting to pay off. I'm just trying to understand the leverage opportunity. What kind of specific benefits have you seen from the spending that you've incurred over the past few quarters?","Vernon J. Nagel","Great question. When we look at our product vitality and the revenues that we're ramping up on, the new product introductions, these are having a favorable impact on top line. When I look at our residential business this quarter, for example, a lot of the new products that were introduced, LED-based products, into that space really have benefited us, as we have offset some of the tepid decline or tepid demand in the nonresidential space. Our lighting systems business we're introducing and have introduced a number of lighting control systems to great fanfare. Our nLight software capability or lighting control system, without providing specific numbers, it more than doubled this quarter relative to its revenues in the year-ago period. So all of these things are fantastic indicators of -- that our strategy is right and the future opportunities where these things find themselves, schools, office buildings, health care facilities, industrial spaces, outdoor -- our outdoor control capability, all these are robust platforms for future growth for us.","Richard K. Reece","And Matt, I would also mention $2 million-or-so of productivity improvements from the streamlining activities that we realized, majority of that is in the SD&A area. And so we are beginning, unlike the Cochran that had been pushed out because of the permitting and other issues, the $6 million of savings from the other streamlining activities, we're now at that full rate. And most of those savings are in the SD&A line that are currently helping us a bit as well.","Operator","Our next question comes from Kathryn Thompson from Thompson Research Group.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Digging a little bit more into pricing, I understand you spent a fair amount of time talking about the mix and how that affects the pricing. But stripping that away, first question is, where in general do you see pricing trends regardless of mix? In other words, when you look at the different, your high-margin projects to your lower-margin products, where generally do you see pricing trends for 2013? And second, along with -- along the lines of pricing, what -- what's really pushing the greater pricing competition toward that lower to mid-tier product? And has that changed, relatively speaking, over the past 6 to 9 months?","Vernon J. Nagel","Kathryn, thank you, this is Vern. First of all, I believe that the conventional lighting product portfolio, middle to upper value lighting propositions, I think that pricing is fairly stable. The notion of selling value-add is still alive and well at some of the lower-end products, more of the, I'll call, value purchases. You see a number of competitors that are in the marketplace, I think, attempting to take share using price as a point of differentiation mostly on stock and flow type things, certainly, not on projects. And even there, I don't see pricing being punitive. It's just that, typically, their business strategy, I call, the termites, the termites tend to use price as their point of differentiation. And I don't know that, that has meaningfully changed in the past 12 months, nor do we expect it to meaningfully change in the next 12 months. I would say relative to the growing LED portfolio, if you look at simply the product of an LED luminaire, it's sure that pricing continues to come down, particularly as cost, chips in particular, become more commoditized. And so that trend has not changed nor do we expect it to change. Profitability, you didn't ask this question, on LED products, I think costs are coming down in an appropriate fashion for a company like Acuity to actually generate profits that are consistent with its other portfolio. And again, there's puts and takes around all of that. So I see, from a simple product perspective, trends continuing as they are. I do believe that lighting solutions, integrated lighting systems, where you're selling not just a discrete luminaire or a discrete control product, you're selling an integrated system into a campus that ties into building management. There, I see the opportunity for price improvements, particularly as features and benefits around lighting control systems come to the forefront and folks understand the value of those. In other words, you're getting energy savings while you're using the space. The luminaire can be dimmed down 30% because there's light coming through the window, so you're able to take advantage of daylight harvesting. I see the opportunity to sell higher value in those kinds of things going forward. So I would expect, as we continue to hone our value proposition around integrated lighting systems for us to actually sell more value per square foot influencing our margins.","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Along that line, with value per square foot, have you been able to quantify -- and this is something that we've talked about in the past, have you been able to quantify and put to relative perspective what the unit value per square foot on average is for Acuity today, and how that has changed well into previous 12 to 24 months?","Vernon J. Nagel","Kathryn, you have asked that question before. It's a fantastic question. I would defer the answer because I believe that we are still very much in our infancy around these things in terms of selling ballistic lighting solutions. We know, for example, when we sell our ROAM value proposition, which is an outdoor lighting control system, there's really no competition for it. So to say that I'm selling a discrete component versus a holistic system, it is a system. And our margins there are favorable. But the investment to really expand that capability, I mean, we're still incurring it. We still have [indiscernible]. I'm sorry?","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","Just finally, I -- you may have mentioned this in  the call, and I apologize if I missed it. But did you quantify your volume growth, excluding LED in the quarter?","Vernon J. Nagel","We did not. And frankly, it's very difficult for us to do that because what LED is doing is it's replacing, for certain customers, a conventional light source luminaire that they would have purchased otherwise. And depending on the luminaire, depending on the application, the price can be anywhere from slightly above parity to quite a bit above parity. So -- and I'll let Ricky respond more at length on this. But the fact of the matter is we don't try to distinguish that difference. Ricky?","Richard K. Reece","Yes, we don't -- one, we don't track units. It's very difficult for us to track units because of the different trends, different accessories and all of that, that come in when you call it a full luminaire. And then you've got the controls and integrated stuff. So trying to get to a unit comparison is virtually impossible. So we look at volume more just as total revenue. And as Vern said, are we cannibalizing, or is this incremental? It's impossible for us to really tell. So the short answer is we don't track, and therefore, not really able to give you a volume number separately or even specific to tell you...","Kathryn I. Thompson - Thompson Research Group, LLC.","But generally, in the past, you've been able to say like 2\/3 of the revenue growth was driven by volume. In general, would you be able to give that in this quarter or...","Richard K. Reece","We said in this quarter about 2% of the revenue growth was in volume, partially offset by price mix.","Operator","Our next question comes from Glenn Wortman from Sidoti & Company.","Glenn Wortman - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Just on the residential business, do you guys see any direct benefit from new home construction or most of your products just going in towards renovation and maybe the surrounding communities? Can you just talk a little bit about that, please?","Vernon J. Nagel","Glenn, we believe that roughly 10% of our revenues are directed towards the residential -- directly towards the residential market. Obviously, we then have the secondary effect of building neighborhoods and things of that nature. The product portfolio that we have directed at residential, driven through our electrical distributor partners, showed nice growth in the quarter and helping to ameliorate some of the, again, tepid demand in nonresidential construction. We're excited about the residential market and what it means over the next handful of years. We expect that market to show growth. It's still operating at very, very low levels compared to historical standards, but growth is growth and we're excited to have it.","Richard K. Reece","And I would add, we continue to fill out more SKUs in the residential area, whether it's through our existing channels or some of the others. So it is an area of opportunity for us as we continue to fill out that capability on the luminaire side, as well as on the solution and system side.","Glenn Wortman - Sidoti & Company, LLC","Okay. And then second question on the gross margin. I understand the mix shifts from quarter-to-quarter. But do you still have a target or maybe an estimate of what your full year gross margin could be or...","Vernon J. Nagel","Look, Glenn, we don't provide guidance on that. But as I said earlier, our gross profit margin is very contingent upon volume and mix. Our expectation is, is that, particularly in the second half of the year, markets will rebound. And I think we have been pretty diligent about bringing variable contribution to our bottom line. And so as you think about your own model or you think about the future of Acuity, our expectation is to have volume growth and to outperform the markets. We have a pretty good track record of bringing the variable contribution margin to the bottom line. So I think you can do your math from that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Brent Thielman from D.A. Davidson.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Vern, your commentary on your daily order rate is being favorable. Should we take that to mean overall volumes are still growing through this current lull in demand, or is it just certain aspects of the business?","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, we wanted to give you, the market, an indication of what we are currently experiencing. We were very specific, really, in our fourth quarter call to talk about the same consistency in demand, our concern about the lull -- you read it in the newspapers everywhere. We do believe that there is pent-up demand out there, and so we think it got pushed out a little bit. And so to give some indication that what we're seeing, based on what we know today, was favorable compared to the year-ago period, we still want to be very cautious in saying that we still expect volatility in demand. You see it. I mean, you see corporate America continuing to build up a huge cash flow. I mean, their cash balances are growing. That means they're not investing. There are positive signs out there. Again, absorption of office space, employment levels, Architecture Billings Index, all of these things are really positive leading indicators for a company like Acuity. And so we're giving you our best crystal ball, and it's cloudy.","Brent Thielman - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division","Understood. And I guess, my second question along those lines. It sounds like the bulk of the new construction projects you're seeing are still sort of smaller than to maybe medium-sized. Based on what you're seeing out there, as far as leading indicators and maybe your own pipeline, is it your expectations, some of the larger, maybe more complex projects, could begin to show up as orders in the second half, and maybe that provides some tailwind in the fiscal '14? Is that a reasonable way to think about it?","Vernon J. Nagel","I think it is. We look at a number of different indicators as do you. Employment, absorption are all, again, positive things. As investors start to see, real estate investors start to see this, and they see tightness in availability, rising commercial rents, which all are occurring, they're more likely to invest in expanding the real estate footprint that's in that particular geography. Another favorable trend is lending standards and demand for loans are starting to increase again. So all of those suggest that as we think about what the next 18, 24, 36 months looks like, those are all favorable indicators for us. This recovery, by all measures, has been very, very slow. And so it's now starting to take hold, and that means employment, so on and so forth start to improve, and that benefits directly a company like Acuity's. And again, I would just say, I think we are uniquely positioned with the product portfolio that we have, including integrated lighting systems, to really leverage that growth cycle.","Richard K. Reece","And I would add another encouraging sign is the residential pickup, as Glenn was referring to earlier. Typically, nonresidential has trailed that 6, 9 months. As residential picks up, you now have to build the schools and the branch banks and the quick foods and all of the other things as these neighborhoods and condominiums and apartments and all start coming up. So that is another encouraging sign that we may see some pickup in the number of new projects as opposed to more of this smaller tenant fit-up or renovation type activity that's been a bigger portion of our business here recently.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","I had a follow-up. Just to summarize, Vern, so if you look at LED and you look at the -- and price and then you look at mix, and if we look at FQ1 versus FQ4, I know there's some seasonal differences in business trends. But it seems like most of the negative impact on the margin line came from mix. Is that a fair summary based on everything I've heard so far?","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes, and puts and takes around investments that we are making in our production facilities to significantly ramp up our new product introductions. We've accelerated -- and I want to be clear on that, we're -- we've accelerated the ramp of new product introductions. And so that is having cost impacts within the facility that as volumes ramp up, we'll be able to leverage those, I think, quite well.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And the price issue seems to be pretty benign then, as an impact. I mean, you mentioned that it's slight but it doesn't seem all that meaningful.","Vernon J. Nagel","We said that we believe that most of the gross margin impact or price mix was due to mix, not price. So to be clear, we felt that pricing in the quarter was benign.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, and just as a follow-up on the outlook. The outlook, the low to mid-single-digit growth, that applies to your fiscal '13, right, your outlook for the market?","Vernon J. Nagel","Yes, that's correct.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay. And then, so how do we interpret that in the scope of going forward? So you had talked about potential -- some prudential weakness here in FQ1 last quarter. Was this quarter the industry worse than you had expected going in, about the same, or is it a function where this was -- it didn't seem like it would be better? But how do we interpret the outlook for the remainder of the year? It seems like maybe the rest of the year is not going to be as strong as what you had envisioned 3 or 4 months ago for the industry?","Vernon J. Nagel","Thanks for the question. The few of us that are sitting in here are not economists. And so we attempt to, as best we can, garner information. Our organization does a great job really garnering the best thinking, whether it's global insights or Dodge or government information. So we accumulate this. We do our own checks with our customer base. And again, we're very fortunate. We sell through 14 different channels here in North America, so we touch a lot of different people. And we try to make sure or understand as best we can what their views are, of what that future holds. We were very concerned, I think, as was indicated in every newspaper, starting in April or May, of pending slowdown and the impact of these global uncertainties, including what was existing in the U.S. and how that might impact business. And I think we talked ourselves into a pretty good slowdown here, and that's what we experienced from the market. I think, we were able to eke out growth that was probably slightly better than the market. I don't have precise data around that yet. It's usually done in hindsight. As we think about what's going forward, again, we're accumulating discussions again with our end-market customers, as well as trying to understand what smarter people than us around third-party forecasters say. And I personally believe that we're still going to have some of this choppiness that we've experienced in both the end of the fourth quarter and in our first quarter because of the fiscal cliff. I think that that's going to continue to be front and center in the headlines, and people take a wait-and-see approach on some of these things when they're investing their money. I believe there's pent-up demand out there. I believe that we'll see that demand flow into orders. But do they deliver in Q2 or Q3? Do they deliver in Q4? We just don't know yet. So what we try to do is give some indication that we're seeing favorable daily order rates compared to our year-ago period, but we believe that there will still be inconsistency in demand because of these uncertainties that still hover out there.","Richard M. Kwas - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division","Okay, that's helpful. I just want to clarify that on -- as it relates to what you said last quarter. So appreciate it.","Vernon J. Nagel","And Rich, Ricky made a point that I want to make sure everyone understands. This is what we believe the market will do. It's our focus and goal to outperform the markets that we serve, to grow faster than them, to continue to penetrate. So just know that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Christopher Glynn from Oppenheimer.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Vern, just wondering how much of a fix you're able to get on the scope of the project delays. And you just mentioned pent-up demand, maybe this is the same field of conversation. But could this project delay thing really set up some surprise strength in the second half, do you think?","Vernon J. Nagel","I don't know if surprise would be the right word. I would say favorability to contribute. We look at the full year. We try not to look at what one quarter means compared to another. We try to execute around that. Where we see opportunity, we're aggressive about going after it. My hope, and hope is not a strategy, but my hope is we get some clarity around these uncertainties that are in the marketplace, enough so that people can get back to doing their business and investing. I'll give you an example, southern California. Because of the fiscal issues that California has, they've delayed in a lot of spending on schools, and yet their population is growing dramatically. So at some point in time, something is going to have to give. These kids need schools, and they'll invest in them. But how people manage their budgets have a direct impact on what they do in terms of their purchases for lighting. So that's just one example, larger municipal projects depending on where the funding has come from. People have taken a wait-and-see approach. I do believe that as people get clarity around what is going to happen, they will begin to invest. And we're starting to see some of that, particularly around absorption in commercial office space.","Christopher Glynn - Oppenheimer & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just the last one. On residential, presumably a long way over a long time for that market to go. Would you look at a larger deal in that space?","Vernon J. Nagel","Well, deals, as you point out, they're -- it takes 2 to tango. So I don't know that there's anything that is available to us that is both desirable and doable. So for us, our access to market and the technology shift is allowing us to really demonstrate our scaling capability. And I would expect us to pick up share in that space relative to what our historical percentages have been. So Ricky is continually looking for opportunities to expand our portfolio through acquisition. And the Adura acquisition is an example of that, though that's not specifically for resi. We will continue to look to build our portfolio, not only through aggressive product launches and introductions, but also complemented with acquisitions.","Richard K. Reece","All I would add is certainly, we'll continue to look, as Vern says, for opportunities not just in residential but otherwise. But as our capability continues to improve as the newer technologies as these solutions, although maybe mostly focused on commercial, the comparability and the ability to leverage that into resi is becoming easier for us. Our market access is okay in that area. So while acquisitions could be an opportunity, I still feel good about our ability to continue our participation there on an organic basis as well.","Operator","Shawn Severson from JMP Securities.","Shawn M. Severson - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","So I have a question on the LED side. I'm just trying to get an idea of where some of the business and the growth is coming from? Are you able to tell if it's kind of retrofit and relight, or is it new construction? And I guess that that's out secondarily, away from maybe the outdoor lighting, but what's going on in the commercial building? Is it a tenant moving into an empty space, or is it an ROI-driven retrofit? Just one more color on what's driving the LED.","Vernon J. Nagel","Without precise knowledge or information in front of me, I would say that it's more skewed towards renovation of existing spaces, particularly obviously on the indoor side. But the outdoor side is also renovation. Parking garages, for example, are a great opportunity for LED luminaires. The outdoor roadway type lighting. I think that, that has probably slowed down a tad relative to where it was, picked [ph] 18 months ago, when a lot of shovel-ready moneys were being directed towards those areas. Still plenty of growth, plenty of potential out there. I would say that the residential side, again, has been an opportunity for growth, more again, renovation than new. We're getting a lot of inquiry -- to the question earlier, a lot of inquiry from commercial office spaces, educational facilities, health care facilities that are looking to add, so I would call it, new construction. And therefore, it's easier to implement a more holistic integrated lighting system into that space. Easier may not be the best choice of words, but it's very simple to do. When it comes to renovating a space, a lot of folks are typically looking at what is the payback around that, and we're seeing success there as well.","Shawn M. Severson - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","And to that point, on the payback, I mean, historically, 2-year type payback being targeted has to be less than 3 generally to get people to move outside of kind of the mosh [ph] markets. But is that still the case? And is that what you are proposing with most of your LED retrofits at this point? Is it a 2- or 3-year kind of [indiscernible]?","Vernon J. Nagel","So Shawn, a key element in that is where is that particular location of that building in terms of its cost per kilowatt hour for energy. So paybacks can be very significantly influenced on cost per kilowatt hour and\/or rebates by utilities in those local markets. So where the cost is high, energy costs are high, where rebates are high, those paybacks are attractive, and we are seeing success there. But I have to say, in other markets where the costs are maybe more normal and the paybacks are pushed out, there are folks who are saying, \"You know what, I want to have a more sustainable footprint. I want to have an office building that is akin to LEED certification. I want to attract my employees this way so on and so forth.\" So we are seeing those more soft benefits or soft opportunities pushing demand as well.","Richard K. Reece","And I would add though, where maintenance is high, Vern had mentioned earlier, where it's very high ceiling in an atrium or a roadway lighting there, where they can factor in the maintenance savings along with the energy savings because of the longer lives that LED offer is a driver that's enabling certain applications to go there. And then I would piggyback on this emotional, not just green and sustainability, but we're seeing for security reasons. ATMs, for example, many of the banks and all are relighting the light at an ATM to go LED, again, because it's less likely to burn out, and for safety and all reasons, our light in that kind of an alternative. So there are reasons besides just an ROI that are certainly factoring into the buying decision that would cause some folks to go beyond that to 2- to 3-year, although certainly that's the primary driver.","Shawn M. Severson - JMP Securities LLC, Research Division","And then last, I know this is very hard question for you guys kind of to answer. But in the lighting retrofits that you're seeing, going back to the idea the LEED certification and sort of more comprehensive approach energy efficiency, are you finding that lighting retrofits are part of larger projects in terms of efficiency and retrofits? Or are you finding lighting is still kind of standing as an independent retrofit project for your customers?","Vernon J. Nagel","Our observation is, is that lighting is the second largest consumer of energy in a space, and yet it's the easiest one to convert. So lighting is an integral part of any energy retrofit that goes on in the building. And lighting also has a meaningful impact on the visual environment. So folks are very focused on how they drive lighting as part of their overall energy retrofit, and we would continue to see that as a significant driver of growth and opportunity going forward.","Operator","Due to time, there are no further questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing marks.","Vernon J. Nagel","Thank you, everyone, for your time this morning. We strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will, over the longer term, deliver strong results and returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may disconnect at this time."],"641":["Acuity Brands, Inc.

After today\u2019s presentation, there will be a formal question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, you may disconnect at this time.","Now, I would like to introduce Mr. Dan Smith, Senior Vice President, Treasurer and Secretary. Sir, you may begin.","Dan Smith","Thank you. With me today to discuss our fiscal 2017 second quarter results are Vern Nagel, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Ricky Reece, our Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. We are webcasting today\u2019s conference call on our website at acuitybrands.com.","I would like to remind everyone that during this call, we may make projections or forward-looking statements regarding future events or future financial performance of the Company. Such statements involve risks and uncertainties such that actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent 10-K and 10-Q SEC filings in today\u2019s press release which identify important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in our projections or forward-looking statements.","Now, let me turn this call over to Vern Nagel.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Dan. Good morning, everyone. Ricky and I would like to make a few comments and then we will answer your questions. Our financial results for the second quarter reflect in large part the impact of continued softness and demand for certain short-cycle, small lighting projects. As I will comment later, we believe this softness for these types of projects is temporary and will rebound. I know many of you have already seen our results and Ricky will provide more detail later in the call, but I would like to make a few comments on the key highlights for the second quarter of 2017.","Net sales for the quarter were $805 million, an increase of almost 4% compared with a year ago period. Reported operating profit was a $108 million compared with a $106.7 million in the year ago period. Reported diluted earnings per share was a $1.53 compared with a $1.49 in the year ago period. There were adjustments in the year ago quarter for certain special items as well as certain add-backs made in both quarters for our results to be comparable between periods as Ricky will explain later in the call. In adding back these items, one can see adjusted operating profit for the second quarter of 2017 was a $123.9 million compared with an adjustment operating profit of $127.4 million in the year ago period, a decrease of 3%. Adjusted operating profit margin was 15.4%, a decrease of a 100 basis points compared with the prior year. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $1.77, down 2% from the year ago period. We closed the quarter with $463 million of cash on hand, leaving us with plenty of financial fire power to execute our growth strategies.","Looking at the key highlights for the second quarter, net sales in the second quarter were up almost 4% over the year ago period. Overall net sales volume grew 4%, while the addition of Juno added another 1 point growth. This was offset by a 1 point decrease in net sales due to changes in the price and mix of products sold. The impact of foreign currency and net sales this quarter was less than 1 point. While it\u2019s not possible to precisely determine the separate impact of price and mix changes on net sales, we believe the difference was primarily due to lower pricing on luminaires largely because of lower component costs of LED fixtures.","A few additional points on the makeup of net sales this quarter. Net sales in Mexico and Europe were negatively impacted by political and economic issues in those regions, reducing our consolidated net sales by almost 1 point this quarter. Further, the increase to net sales was broad based along key product lines and sales channels in the US and Canada. However, we believe overall market demand remained weaker than most forecasters originally anticipated, particularly for smaller projects. Nonetheless, we believe we still meaningfully outperformed the growth rate of the overall market allowing us to continue to gain market share. To add a bit more color on this, while available market data does not line up perfectly with our quarters, we have recent information from various organizations including U.S. Census Bureau and NIMA which suggests construction put in place for the quarter was against softer than anticipated while actual data for shipments of lighting fixtures in the last two quarters of calendar 2016, show the lighting market was slightly down compared with periods one year earlier.","Nonetheless, we were still able to grow our legacy business in the US and Canada by 5% this quarter far outpacing the growth of the overall lighting industry. I will comment more on our expectations for the balance of 2017 later in the call.","Sales of LED products grew robustly this quarter and account for two-thirds of our total net sales, which as you know includes the sale of non-fixture related products and solutions as well. Lastly, we believe our channel and product diversification as well as our strategies to better serve customers with new, more innovative, and holistic lighting and building management solutions, and the strength of our many sales forces have allowed us to yet again achieve solid sales growth this quarter, particularly against the backdrop of a softer than expected market environment. Our profitability measures for the second quarter were solid, but very much impacted by these tepid market conditions.","Our adjusted operating profit for the second quarter was a $123.9 million, down $3.5 million compared with the year ago period while adjusted operating profit for the quarter was 15.4%, down 100 basis points from the adjusted margin in the year-ago period.","The decline in adjusted operating profit was primarily due to lower adjusted gross profit. Gross profit in the second quarter was essentially flat compared with the year-ago period while adjusted gross profit declined $2.5 million. Gross profit margin for the second quarter was 41.7% compared with adjusted gross profit margin of 43.5%, one year earlier, a decrease of 180 basis points.","The modest decline in gross profit this quarter compared with the adjusted gross profit reported in the year-ago period was primarily due to higher manufacturing costs and a rise in quality costs, partially offset by the increase in net sales, lower component costs and productivity improvements, primarily from previously announced streamlining actions. In addition to the factors just noted, adjusted gross profit margin was also impacted by the mix of products sold through certain sales channels.","Like last quarter, we carried a higher manufacturing cost structure into the quarter in anticipation of servicing a greater level of demand than actually occurred, impacting both gross profit and gross profit margin. As I will point out later in the call, we believe the weakness in demand, particularly for certain smaller short-cycle projects will rebound and therefore, by strategy, we are maintaining our capabilities and organization structure. But to be very clear, we understand that this strategy is having the impact on our short-term profitability metrics.","Next, adjusted SDA expenses were up $1 million over the year-ago period. Adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales was 26.3% in the second quarter, a decrease of 80 basis points from the year-ago period. The slight increase in adjusted SDA expense was primarily due to higher freight and commission costs to support the increase in net sales, the inclusion of Juno and continued investment in additional headcount to support and drive our tiered solution strategy. This was mostly offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Our incentive compensation program is based on period-over-period improvement in our key financial metrics, which are an integral part of our pay-for-performance culture.","Our first half performance this year has resulted in a much lower potential payout that we accrued in the year-ago period. Our adjusted diluted EPS was $1.77 compared with $1.80 reported in the year-ago period. The decline was primarily due to lower adjusted operating profit, partially offset by a lower tax rate this quarter.","Before I turn the call over to Ricky, I would like to comment on a few important strategic accomplishments. On the strategic front, we continue to make great strides, setting the stage for what we believe will be strong growth and profitability over the long-term. We continued our rapid pace of introducing new products and solutions, expanding our industry-leading portfolio of innovative, energy-efficient luminaires and lighting control solutions as well as our building management platform. Many of these solutions are connected to our IoT software platform as innovation continues to be at the forefront of our tiered solution strategy.","While sales data for our tiered solutions is still imprecise and extending off a small base, we believe sales in our Tier 3 category encompassing our holistic integrated solutions were up 25% this quarter and now represent more than 12% of our total net sales. Furthermore, our Tier 3 solutions can be enabled to collect data and to support connectivity to the Internet of Things affording Acuity additional recurring revenue streams, which we identify as Tier 4 solutions.","To fully execute our holistic tiered solution strategy, we have added enormous capabilities over the last year and a half, including recent acquisitions as well as increased salaried headcount. In fact, excluding the impact of acquisitions, our salaried headcount is up almost 200 associates or over 6% from one year earlier. We continue to make these investments despite the current softness in demand because we see tremendous opportunities for future profitable growth in these areas. Few of our competitors, if any, have been able to make these investments while delivering financial performance like Acuity.","At Acuity, we\u2019re not just talking Internet of Things, we\u2019re doing it. We continue to increase the scale and scope of our solutions, having recently upgraded our nearly 50 million square foot lighting beacon network to encompass additional ambient intelligence. This smart solutions infrastructure using digital lighting and building management systems as its backbone, creates an advanced sensory network, made even more capable through connections to the Acuity IoT software platform. This platform enables endless possibilities for our customers to enhance the utilization of their space through better human interaction and greater asset and employee productivity. Building on a foundation of indoor positioning solutions including way finding, we\u2019ve upgraded our network to include Bluetooth tag based asset tracking in more robust geospatial and other valuable analytics.","Today this platform encompasses more than 0.5 million LED light fixtures, each enabled with multiple sensing devices to form a broad sensory network, collecting data and enabling applications that provide users with superior lighting and energy performance as well as useful actionable information. These data and enabling applications are now providing Acuity with a recurring cloud-based service revenue stream. ","Importantly, we expect the installed base of these smart lighting solutions meaningfully expand as the benefit of these capabilities become more known by end users and several key verticals. We believe this level of capability and deployment continues to be unmatched in our industry. We have been able to create these capabilities while providing industry-leading results because of the dedication result of our 12,000 associates who are manically focused on serving, solving and supporting the needs of our customers. I will talk more about our future growth strategies and our expectations for the construction market later in the call.","I would like to now turn the call over to Ricky before I make a few comments regarding our focus for the balance of 2017. Ricky?","Ricky Reece","Thank you, Vern, and good morning everyone. As Vern mentioned earlier, we had some adjustments to the GAAP results in fiscal 2017 and 2016, which we find useful to add back for the results to be comparable. In our earnings release, we provide a detailed reconciliation of non-GAAP measures. Primarily due to the impact of the four acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2016, we experienced noticeable increases in amortization of acquired intangible assets, share-based compensation expense since we used restricted stock as a tool to improve retention and to allowing the interest of key leaders of acquired business with those of the shareholders.","Acquisition-related costs, special charges, manufacturing inefficiencies related to the closing of a facility and a gain on the sale of an investment in a non-consolidated affiliate. We believe adjusting for these items and providing these non-GAAP measures provide greater comparability and enhance visibility into our results of operations.","We think you will find this transparency very helpful in your analysis of our performance. In addition, many of our peer companies especially as we become more of a technology company, made the same adjustments so to help you as you compare our performance to other public companies in our industry.","The effective tax rate for the second quarter was 32.3% compared with 34.2% in the second quarter of last year. The decrease in the effective income tax rate was due primarily to the tax impact of a discrete non-recurring item related to the issuance of new IRS regulations during the current quarter related to taxation of foreign currency translation gains and losses on intercompany accounts. We expect the effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 to be approximately 35% before any additional discrete items and if the rates in our taxing jurisdictions remain generally consistent throughout the year.","During the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we finalized the purchase accounting allocation for Juno Lighting. As a result, the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date were adjusted to reflect the finalization of the valuation of customer relationships and certain acquired accrued liabilities. These adjustments resulted in an $81 million increase in intangible assets, a decreasing in goodwill of $50 million and an increase to deferred income tax liabilities of $30 million and a decrease to net operating working capital of $1 million as of February 28, 2017. In addition, we recorded a cumulative addition to amortization expense of approximately $2 million in the current quarter. With these changes, amortization expense is expected to be approximately $25 million annually.","At February 28, 2017, we had a cash and cash equivalent balance of $463.2 million, an increase of $50 million since August 31, 2016. Our operating working capital defined as receivable plus inventory less payables at February 28, 2017, increased to 54 days compared with 45 days in the prior year. The increase was due primarily to the increased inventory to support expected higher sales and to improve delivery performance. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2017, we spent $35.8 million on capital expenditures compared with $43.8 million in the prior year, the decrease in capital expenditures is primarily due to the reduced spending on facility renovations.","We currently expect to spend approximately between $2 million and $2.5 million of revenue in capital expenditures in fiscal year 2017. Our total debt outstanding was $356 million at February 28, 2017. We had more cash than debt at February 28, 2017. We had additional borrowing capacity of $243.9 million at the end of the quarter under our credit facility which does not expire until August 2019. We clearly enjoy a significant financial strength and flexibility and will continue to seek the best use of our strong cash generation to enhance shareholder value.","Thank you, and I\u2019ll turn the call back to Vern.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, Ricky. Just to be clear, I think what Ricky said, we intend spend between 2% and 2.5% of sales in fiscal 2017 on CapEx, not between $2 million and $2.5 million.","Ricky Reece","Thank you.","Vern Nagel","While market conditions in the first half of fiscal 2017 were much softer than most had anticipated, we continue to see significant long-term growth opportunities that are ever-changing and evolving in a positive direction for Acuity. Recent economic and industry data shows the end markets we serve in North America and certain markets in Europe through the first half of our year moved along at a much slower and more inconsistent pace than was originally anticipated by various forecasting organizations. In fact, it now appears from various data sources we collect that the slowdown in market demand started in the third quarter of calendar 2016.","While there is much speculation as to what precipitated the slowdown, many of our end customers infer this year\u2019s presidential election in the U.S. and certain political events in Europe created uncertainty and volatility, which tempered end-user demand, particularly for certain smaller projects that have short lead times and to a lesser degree, residential construction. Additionally, we continue to hear from customers that labor shortages in certain markets continue to cause delays in larger projects. How much should have all this directly impacted our shipments in the first half of fiscal 2017 is difficult to precisely quantify, but we anticipated and planned for greater shipments than actually occurred.","While we believe the softness in demand experienced in the first half of fiscal 2017 is temporary, the same conditions could potentially linger into the second half of 2017. Nonetheless, we believe the long-term fundamental drivers of the markets we serve are still positive and intact. As we noted in our last 10-K, based on third-party market forecast for the lighting industry, we expect that the broad end markets that we serve in North America, which represents about 97% of our total net sales, would grow in the mid-to-upper single-digit range in fiscal 2017.","Given the actual market data, which shows that lighting sales in our first half were slightly down compared with the year-ago periods, many market forecasters now believe the market will be flat to slightly positive in the second half of fiscal 2017 followed by stronger growth in fiscal 2018. This, notwithstanding, we remain bullish regarding the company\u2019s long-term prospects for profitable growth, particularly as we bring more value-added solutions to the market for both new construction and the conversion of the installed base.","We continue to see signs that give us more optimism regarding the future growth of the markets we serve than third-party forecast. Leading indicators for the North American market such as architectural billing index, vacancy rates, office absorption, lending availability and favorable employment trends continue to improve at varying paces. So, the following are a few of our key assumptions as we focus on the second half of fiscal 2017.","Given the information I just noted above, we expect the lighting market in North America, our largest market, to grow in the low single digits in the second half of fiscal 2017. Next, we expect the price of certain LED components to continue to decline while certain other costs, including steel and certain other commodity costs as well as certain employee-related costs, primarily due to further investments in associate headcount, wage inflation and health care costs, will increase somewhat. We expect to offset the impact of these rising costs through certain pricing initiatives, productivity improvements and product cost reductions.","Next, we continue to be leery of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which are unpredictable. Next, while our gross profit margins influenced by several factors, including sales volume, innovation, components and commodity costs, and mix changes for prices, products and sales channels, we expect our annual gross profit margin to improve over time as volumes grows and as we realize typical gains in the manufacturing efficiencies including cost savings related to recent acquisitions and new product introductions.","We continue to target a current variable contribution margin on an incremental dollar of sales in the mid to upper 20% range over a full year period, knowing that it is not possible to predict with precision what the rate will be by quarter. Obviously, given our results in the first half, this target range will be a challenge for us to achieve for the full year fiscal 2017.","Next, our adjusted SDA expense as a percentages of sales was 26% this half. This is below our recent trend, primarily due to much lower incentive compensation expense. Trust me, we\u2019re motivated to drive to strong period over period growth which is at the core of our pay for performance culture, which would result in much higher incentive compensation expense. This means we would expect our adjusted SDA expense as a percentage of net sales to be closer to our historical trend, assuming markets rebound somewhat as we noted earlier and we continue to meaningfully outpace the growth rates of the markets we serve.","This further assumes we execute as we have in the past regarding our supply chain performance and can move gross margins toward our historical trend. So, to be very clear, our key assumptions are to garner additional top line growth driven primarily by our ability to outperform the growth rates of the markets we serve and to leverage our infrastructure achieving targeted incremental margins to improve our overall profitability.","Looking more specifically at our Company, we are very excited by and focused on the many opportunities to enhance our already strong platform including the expansion of our Tier 3 and 4 holistic lighting, building management and IoT smart platform solutions. We continue to expand the number of pilot programs with customers for these smart platforms and experience strong interest from many other key customers in multiple verticals for our holistic solutions with these capabilities and more.","As we have noted in our last several conference calls, the implementation of our integrated tiered solution strategy and our opportunities to meaningfully participate in the interconnected world is an integral part of our overall growth strategy to meaningfully expand our addressable market by adding significantly greater broad based holistic solutions that will allow our customers to optimize the performance of their facilitates. As we noted earlier, while we are very early in this game, we are seeing positive results in growth rates for our Tire 3 and Tier 4 categories as well as the acceptance of for IoT enabled smart platform solutions.","Our companywide strategy is straight forward, expand and leverage our industry leading product and solutions portfolio coupled with our extensive market presence and our considerable financial strength to capitalize on market growth opportunities that\u2019ll provide our customers with unmatched value and our shareholders with superior returns. This all takes focus and resources. We\u2019re investing today to enhance and expand our core competencies affording us the opportunity to excel in our fast changing industry because we see great future opportunities.","Through these investments, we\u2019re significantly expanding our addressable market. Our strong growth record supports this view. As I\u2019ve said before, we believe the lighting and lighting related industry as well as the building management systems market will experience significant growth over the next decade because of the continued opportunities for new construction and more importantly the conversion of the installed base, which is enormous in size to more efficient and effective solutions.","We believe this is particularly compelling as energy and environmental concerns continue to come to the forefront along with merging opportunities for digital lightening to play a key role in the Internet of Things. We continue to believe that many markets we serve as part of the broader lighting and building management industries, some of which could grow very significantly over the next few years will drive us with significant growth potential. As the market leader in the lighting solutions and the technology leader in building automation, we are positioned well to fully participate in these exciting and growing industries.","Thank you. And with that, we will entertain any questions that you have.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is coming from the line of Mr. Rich Kwas from Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. ","Rich Kwas","Hi. Good morning. Vern, could you give us some color around the quarter as it relates to project activity, project growth and short-cycle activity? You talked qualitatively about it; last quarter you gave some round estimates around what you thought the those markets did. Could you update us on that? And then, what\u2019s the assumption for each of those areas for the back half of the fiscal year?","Vern Nagel","Sure. So, when we think about our business, between 70%, 75%, those are rough numbers, we consider project type business, the other 25% will be stock oriented business. Within the project side, you have multiple size projects, small, medium and large. We think that the larger project business continued to move along nicely; quotation rates were solid, shipments were solid. And in fact, these were in sort of mid double-digit range or mid teens I should say in terms of growth. It was that smaller project that\u2019s more the stock and flow, more flow type projects, smaller in nature, short-cycle in nature that seemingly was under duress, if you will of, somewhat tepid in the market. I spend a lot of time with our electrical distributor customers, with contractors, different channels trying to understand where is their industry and what are they seeing. And truthfully, it feels to us and this is why we slightly disagree with some of the third-party forecasters regarding the overall trends for the balance of -- our fiscal 2017, calendar 2017 and then in the 2018.","We are more optimistic about the opportunities because what you\u2019re seeing is on these larger projects, you\u2019re seeing great code activity, contract awards; you\u2019re seeing a lot of positive activity. So, we\u2019re not seeing the slowdown there. This is why on the smaller short-cycle projects, it doesn\u2019t really make a lot of sense that these things are going to continue to remain tepid and soft while larger projects continue to remain very favorable. So, our view is that based on customer or consumer confidence, business confidence, those short-cycle things can ebb and flow.","When we think about the key demand drivers in our business, whether it\u2019s employment -- employment participation is favorable; housing start, they took a little depth, I think October was a 1.3 million starts, November was 1.1 million, maybe slightly less than that. Our expectation is that based on demographics and employment, you\u2019re going to continue to see a more favorable trend. C&I loans continue to be up mid single-digits. The architectural billing index, while it\u2019s been a little bit up and down, it\u2019s been mostly up and we expect that trend to continue. The Dodge Momentum Index, which is a favorable leading indicator for us, while it has its fits and starts, continues to be very favorable.","And then lastly, when you think about office, vacancy rates and you think about net absorption, all of those continue to be favorable. So, it feels to us like for whatever is causing this sort of short-cycle temporary tepid demand, that fixes itself because we just see the longer term fundamental drivers as being favorable. And as we have carried additional manufacturing cost structure in place because we believe in this. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to do that. Until the trends start to flash a much more serious signal or a negative signal, we believe that the market opportunities are there. And as we continue to drive innovation and greater solutions, we think we can capture that share.","You didn\u2019t ask, but I\u2019m going to say, my guess is, is that we carried probably an extra $12 million of cost into the quarter, which from a gross profit perspective is probably 150 basis points of investment that we\u2019re not going to get a return for. And we know that our strategy right now is having a short-term impact on our financial results, but we\u2019re just not going to give up the capabilities that we have. We\u2019re going to continue to attack the market and differentiate to drive this growth, which we expect to turnaround.","Rich Kwas","Just as a follow-up, my follow-up, around your comments around mid-teens and then kind of flattish or maybe down slightly for small projects, I mean the math suggests something worse than that on the small projects side. So, if the large projects are up mid-teens, small projects would seem to be down, something in the neighborhood of 20% to get to your blended number. So, can you help me on that? And then secondary question, real quick is, is there something more structural going on, the short-cycle stuff because some channel partners have talked about increased competition from imports and maybe distributors stocking less than they used to around short-cycle contractor type products? I don\u2019t know if you have any color on that. Thanks.","Vern Nagel","Sure. So, again, when I say larger projects, I\u2019m talking about large projects, and these things are pick your number, $0.5 million and above. Those types of things continue to move along. And so, those represent a smaller portion. I won\u2019t give you exact number. But when you get into those small projects, those represent -- of the 70% to 75%, they represent a much smaller percentage. So you\u2019re right. It\u2019s tempting to do that math, but that\u2019s not the right mix number. So, I wouldn\u2019t go there. I\u2019m not going to provide exact breakouts because it\u2019s a bit of a challenge to precisely quantify what is small, medium and large. We have an internal way of looking at that, but it\u2019s not precise math.","So, I would say to you that those larger projects continue to move along at a favorable rate. And so our overall mix of that 70% to 75% is less than sort of the mid-teens because the small short-cycle projects pull that down. Stock and flow also continues to be somewhat flattish.","I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a structural thing within the electrical distributor world. What they try to do is obviously manage their inventories to what demand is. I think as demand slowed, what a number of our electrical distributor customers told us is that they were looking to balance their inventories to meet -- or to be more consistent with sales. Now, having said that, many of them are bullish about the second half of their calendar 2017 year, and where they derive their optimism is from what contractors are telling them around the broad base of projects, whether it be stock for them or small flow projects, medium or larger projects, where you have specification involved.","So, we are getting more positive signals than, if you will, what market forecasters have called for. They\u2019re the same people that called for a mid to upper single digit growth, and the market\u2019s obviously turned. So, we\u2019re betting more on the fact that folks who are right next to the customer and who are dealing with the demand and capabilities every day, I think have a better sense of what\u2019s happening. And many of you folks who do channel checks, I think you can confirm that that they said markets were soft for -- here recently, but their backlogs and some of the things that they\u2019re looking at are more bullish. I don\u2019t believe that there is a huge structural shift. It doesn\u2019t mean that distributors aren\u2019t focused around their inventories where things have the opportunity through new technology to be somewhat advanced, but guess what? They get paid to have inventory on hand to serve the needs of their customers. And we feel that our connectivity with those electrical distributors through our supply chain, which is very robust, gives them the opportunity to meet the kind of customer service requirements that they have and to not get caught, if you will, with inventory on hand.","We\u2019ve also heard that people are somewhat concerned about other types of technology, not technology, but tubes and other things that might be coming in from foreign markets. We see that, but I just don\u2019t feel that that is a major shift in what folks are doing. I just -- we see it all the time, that type of competition from foreign folks. It\u2019s not new. I don\u2019t see it increasing or being anymore intent than it has been in the past. So, I just don\u2019t feel, Rich, to your last question that there\u2019s been a technology or a fundamental structural shift in how distributors are -- have always managed their business.","Operator","The next question is coming from the line of Jeff Osborne from Cowen and Company. Your line is now open.","Jeff Osborne","Just to follow up on the weakness on the short-cycle business. Vern, I was wondering, is there any regional commentary that you can share? And then also just the second question I had is any thoughts on the buyback?","Vern Nagel","From a regional perspective, I\u2019m trying to think. We have a few markets that were a little bit softer in terms of our shipments than other markets that we tend to see that ebbing and flowing. I don\u2019t think I could call out any one that was demonstrably different than the other.","Jeff Osborne","I guess, what I was getting at is I wasn\u2019t sure if there\u2019s any notable weakness in historically, more Democratic states than Republican or it was just more widespread?","Vern Nagel","That\u2019s an interesting question. We have not put up a red and blue calendar and measured that. I would say that it still is a bit more by geography to a degree, California and those markets, where you have high-cost of energy continue to move along; markets where the cost of energy may not be as be as high, some of those areas may tend to say, I\u2019ll wait and see. It\u2019s impossible to quantify business sentiment and what drives exactly that are consumer sentiment, still think that as home values improve through the home improvement channel and certain portions of the electrical distribution, they\u2019re providing value to people who want to do those things. But even, if you look at housing starts, those things slowed down a little bit, why, whether it was fantastic in most parts of the country. So, again, we think that that\u2019s a temporary situation. Ricky, with regard to stock buyback?","Ricky Reece","Yes. We do have as you\u2019re aware an authorization from our Board to repurchase 2 million shares; we repurchased the de minimis amount this last quarter. So, we do have that there. We will continue to look at the most appropriate use of our cash and our capital allocation to enhance shareholder value with acquisitions or primary choice, but if the acquisitions don\u2019t provide the opportunity that we think is appropriate, then certainly share buybacks is something we have used in the past and are something that we could use in the future.","Vern Nagel","One other element to your question, earlier around geography, I would say that when we look at, our business in Mexico, normally when you come near an election cycle, you tend to see a little bit of inconsistent demand shipment. I think it\u2019s being exacerbated by some of the rhetoric that\u2019s going on in terms of the negotiations between Mexico and the U.S. Our capabilities in Mexico are fantastic. The market there we think has long-term growth potential. Interestingly the peso has strengthened here recently. Spain, where we have operations, they similarly can be influenced by local election cycle that\u2019s occurring right now. But I think that there are broader structural things that are going on where people are still taking a wait and see approach. Our business in the UK is a nice little business, got a great little Company there, but they are being influenced by the withdrawing [ph] or what\u2019s going on with Brexit. So, when we look at those markets, it was another point of growth that kind of went away. We expect there to be once there is clarity for those markets to rebound, but that was a point of growth, that\u2019s why we made the point in our overall comments that Canada and the US markets show kind of that mid single-digit growth rates, 5% in terms of sales volume. So, that was favorable to us.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is coming from the line of Mr. Ryan Merkel from William Blair. Your line is now open.","Ryan Merkel","First question for me is what was the order intake in March? And if the industry outlook is sort of flat in 2017, can you take market share and still grow sales low single-digits in the second half of 2017?","Vern Nagel","Well, I think we have had a long history of outperforming the growth rates of the markets that we serve. I mean, the spread between what our growth rate is and what the market growth rate is has been pretty consistently big. And so, our expectations based on the products portfolio, our access to market, bringing more solutions to the market, we would expect to continue to outperform the growth rates. And quite frankly, look to even add to that spread as we go forward. So that is a strong focus of our team. And as we look at various verticals, how can we continue to grow and add value there that is very much our focus.","When we look at our order rates for the month of March, truthfully, we\u2019re looking at more of a sequential basis because March a year ago had some anomalies in it. So, when we look at sequential growth rates in our order rates, we see favorability. Our backlog is up compared to the year-ago period going into the fourth quarter backlog, not hugely important to us because it represents probably three weeks worth of revenues, but it was up 7% or 8% coming off again a fairly tepid environment.","Our expectation is that these growth rates will continue to pick up, particularly as we enter the spring cycle, which for us is a very positive cycle. Spring and summer, as you know are our busiest months. And we\u2019re feeling, if you will, bullish around the favorability of some of the end markets. So, we\u2019ll see. I mean, we were -- as you know, we carried a higher cost structure into both the first quarter and the second quarter. So, we\u2019re going to continue to do that because again, the long-term drivers of our business continue to flash green and positive signals for us.","Ryan Merkel","So, it sounds like based on what you\u2019re seeing in March, things are stable and you continue to take -- you\u2019d continue to expect to take market share in the second half of the year?","Vern Nagel","Correct.","Ryan Merkel","Okay. And then the other big question everyone\u2019s sort of asking is, are there any signs that price competition is heating up as competitors look to protect share? Obviously, with price only down 1% in the quarter, it looks like it\u2019s not an issue yet, but any commentary there I think would be helpful.","Vern Nagel","Sure. Again, part of and I think a large part of Acuity\u2019s ability to gain share is that we reach into that installed base that renovation market, where the competition is primarily the act of doing nothing. I do believe that some of the tepidness that we felt in demand was because of folks saying I\u2019m going to take a little bit of a wait and see approach. The returns are compelling for folks to do renovation of their existing space using energy-efficient lighting, use taking advantage of building management capabilities, taking advantage of some of these IoT solutions sets. But if your confidence for whatever reason is somewhat shaking, you tend to say I\u2019m going to wait and see.","I believe that our ability to continue to gain share will be as the markets -- or excuse me, as business and consumer sentiment start to come back, and I think it is. I think you\u2019re seeing, for the most part, businesses are massively favorable about what they expect to happen in terms of tax reform, regulatory reform. But if you\u2019re a smaller, short-cycle person, you may say I\u2019m going to keep my cash for a little while and see what happens. I believe that folks are starting to say okay, the sky didn\u2019t fall, how do I get back to doing my business? And I believe that you\u2019re going to start to see the uptick of those things."," So, where we are expecting to gain share is not just on our traditional business of new construction, whether it\u2019s small, medium, large or supporting our strategic electrical distributors with great products and solutions, but we also expect to drive a difference and have been driving a difference, hence, the spread between the overall rates of the market and what our growth rate has been because we are reaching into that installed base. So I would expect us to continue to do that.","Operator","Thank you. Next question is from John Quealy, Canaccord Genuity. Your line is now open. ","John Quealy","First question, in terms of the additional $20 million, I guess, of carrying cost that we\u2019re carrying here, I guess, you\u2019d continue to do that for the next few quarters, wait for what fiscal 2018 has in store? And then, I guess, Vern and Ricky, what would you need to see to change that or take those costs out from a third-party data point perspective? I just have one quick follow-up.","Vern Nagel","Sure. First, I believe the number is more $12 million, not $20 million, just to put it in perspective. I mean, it\u2019s still a significant number. It\u2019s just extra people. But again, when we think about the various types of both verticals that we serve, the size of projects that we serve, whether it\u2019s indoor, outdoor, again, we\u2019re just -- the data is strong, supporting that we -- that there was a slowdown in luminaire shipments, second half of 2016 first quarter, so far of 2017. But again, when we look at -- and there is pretty strong correlation to these longer term drivers of our business that I mentioned earlier, and those things are favorable; business is usually a positive. ","So, to me, it\u2019s not only are these things flashing positive signals, but as we continue to enhance our capabilities to get after that renovation and as we continue to enhance our capabilities around our IoT software platform, as more and more people are becoming confident with their test pilots and things that they\u2019re doing, we just see positive growth. And so, we\u2019re going to continue to do that. I think that it was a statistic that I read, one economist who has a pretty good track record said that 2016 was the weakest economy or economic environment that we\u2019ve had since 2013. I don\u2019t -- I\u2019m not an economist, so we sort of follow these things, but we listen very intently to our customers. At the end markets, things were softening. So, electrical distributors just to pick on stock and flow, were looking to balance, rebalance inventories. Still feel that the positive signals are going to allow us and them to continue to invest and make sure that we are supporting construction activity that we believe is going to be there.","When we talk to electrical contractors, essentially, they\u2019re saying that their backlogs are strong, but it depends on who they are. It depends on what type of projects that they\u2019re working on. The folks that are in that medium to larger type project, those folks I think feel pretty bullish, and that\u2019s pretty consistent around the country. Some of them are talking about the notion of having challenges finding enough electricians to do jobs. So, what they\u2019re looking to do is pick and choose the jobs that they do to optimize their profitability. But again, I think that over the long term that, that situation, that imbalanced heals itself as more people come back into the work environment and do those things.","So, we would look to these indicators that say to us that we think things are going to get soft here. And if you look over our last 15-year track record, we\u2019ve been pretty aggressive when we see markets that are not -- that are turning to structure our business appropriately to continue to protect our profitability as best as we can. We would book to do that, we just don\u2019t feel right now is the time. I know it\u2019s painful in the short-term carrying these costs, but we believe that this is still the right thing to do to continue to capture profitable market share.","John Quealy","Okay. Thank you for that. And then, a quick follow-up, in terms of Tier 4 solutions, I know many of us are looking for a target type announcement and maybe that\u2019s a false expectation. How do you think we should look for development in the market especially as your Tier 4 solution takes off in the next couple of quarters? What\u2019s the good benchmark to look to? Thank you, folks.","Vern Nagel","Sure. First of all, we have a large installation going on with a leading -- a world leading retailer. We did not mention name, so we\u2019re not going to mention names, but that project continues to move along with that particular retailer whose name we didn\u2019t mention, in a favorable way. We believe that the solutions that they are starting to realize are very valuable. When I think about our overall smart solution platform and the focus that we have, we now have well over 20 strong engagements with six different verticals. We have almost two handful of pilots going on. And when we think about rollouts, we\u2019re actually rolling out in three different verticals, retail being one of them, but other projects that are now robust. Many of these folks that we\u2019re dealing with, they want to get their install base up and operating, and then they will make announcements about how they want to have the marketplace perceive these things. And I think that as they do that, as you compare to any particular vertical as they\u2019re installing this strong or smart solutions platform, they want to get it up and running and then they make the big splash. Those will be the kinds of things that you\u2019ll see.","We are very pleased with where we are today. Again, we have north of 50 million square feet providing a strong ambient technical capability to them, collecting data, over a 0.5 million LED luminaires, probably well north of 1 million sensors, because many of these luminaries have multiple sensors, the ability to now really use capabilities to track assets, really honing that capability. And so the level of interest that we have from multiple verticals, multiple institutions is really positive. And you\u2019ll continue to see as we port out square footage of things of this nature, we just know it\u2019s lumpy, but the lumpiness is only I think a temporary thing as more and more folks become aware of these capabilities. Our teams were just at the NRF show as well as Shoptalk and the Fanfare around what many of these CEOs, CMOs, CIOs, CFOs saw in our solutions that\u2019s robustly positive. And so, we\u2019re expecting these things to really continue to drive great value. And we\u2019ll keep people posted as we do. To the extent that we are able to announce names as part of these programs, we\u2019ll do it. But right now, we\u2019re not able to do that.","Operator","Thank you. The next question comes from the line of Mr. Matt McCall of Seaport Global. Your line is now open.","Matt McCall","So, Vern, you talked about the kind of the full year target for your contribution margins. And I think you said that -- you talked about returning to the historical trend for both SD&A and gross margin. Can you kind of flush out a little bit more? When I look at gross margin, you\u2019re kind of there, other than this year, I guess where consensus was, you\u2019re kind of there in that 43% range in SD&A; it\u2019s 27 closer to that historical trend, I\u2019m just trying to figure out what trend you are pointing to?","Vern Nagel","Sure. So, our adjusted gross profit this quarter was about 41.8, 41.7 something like that. The notion of what we\u2019re carrying, what we believe we\u2019re carrying as incremental cost, little bit of quality issues there are too but that\u2019s extraordinarily temporarily. You are right, gets us into that sort of mid-43 range; we think our potential is higher than that; you saw what we did in the third quarter of last year, I think we were in the mid-44 range. SDA is we\u2019ve added investments with people. So that\u2019s why I wanted to make the point that we\u2019ve probably added close to 200 associates on a year-over-year basis, salaried associates. So, we\u2019re carrying that cost. Obviously we need those revenues and that variable contribution to cover those incremental salaries.","Today, we are funding those incremental folks with little incentive compensation. So, we\u2019re funding our own growth if you will but we believe in it strongly. So, we\u2019re willing to do that. I believe that the SDA number probably in the nearer term is more of a 26% to 27% range. But, this is why we bring people back to variable contribution. Normally, we\u2019re able to do that; this quarter we didn\u2019t have variable contribution; it was negative. That\u2019s not something that we have done in probably five years, again reflecting both the tepid environment for certain projects as low as the increased investment, both in SDA and gross profit.","So, we\u2019re targeting again gross profit in that above 43% and SDA probably in the mid-26 range in the nearer term. But again, our goal is to continue to drive beyond that. I do like the fact that typically our variable contribution margin should be in that mid to upper 20 range, at least in the nearer term. We\u2019re still investing in people. So, we have to carry that cost, if you will, and that\u2019s what\u2019s keeping in that range there. As our mix changes, as we continue to grow Tier 3 and have Tier 4 type of revenues, we would expect our gross profit margin to continue to improve.","Matt McCall","Okay. So, I think about the components that you called out, so the $12 million of cost you are carrying in excess of maybe what you need near-term, incentive comp, you also talked about higher manufacturing cost and higher quality cost. Can you quantify? I don\u2019t know if you quantified incentive comp; can you quantify manufacturing cost and then the quality cost; what were the impacts?","Vern Nagel","Yes. So, that\u2019s the $12 million number that is in the gross profit side. We believe if that infrastructure costs in our gross profit line, probably a $12 million number in its totality.","Matt McCall","Okay. And the incentive comp is, did you quantify that number or is that in that 12 as well? The incentive comp is lower, so did you quantify the benefit?","Vern Nagel","The incentive is in the SDA. You\u2019ve seen what we\u2019ve been able to do. We delivered 26%. We told you that we\u2019re up about almost 200 folks. You could probably back into the year ago period by taking Q2, making a guess on 200 folks, what that would cost you; you then could back into what the SDA difference is. We don\u2019t provide that number for incentive comp but I think you could probably get there.","Operator","I would like to turn the call back over to Mr. Vernon Nagel for closing remarks.","Vern Nagel","Thank you, everyone. Thank you for your time this morning. We again strongly believe we are focusing on the right objectives, deploying the proper strategies, and driving the organization to succeed in critical areas that will, over the longer term, continue to deliver strong returns to our key stakeholders. Our future is very bright and I really want to emphasize that; it is very bright. Thank you for your support.","Operator","Thank you. And that concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you all for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
