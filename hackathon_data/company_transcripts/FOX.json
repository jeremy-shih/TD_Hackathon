At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Instructions will be given at that time. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded.","Now, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to our host, Mr. Reed Nolte, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations.","Reed Nolte","Thank you very much, operator. Hello, everyone, and welcome to our third quarter fiscal 2015 earnings conference call. On the call today are Chase Carey, President and Chief Operating Officer; James Murdoch, Co-Chief Operating Officer; and John Nallen, our Chief Financial Officer.","First, we\u2019ll give some prepared remarks on the most recent quarter, and we\u2019ll be happy to take questions from the investment community.","This call may include certain forward-looking information with respect to 21st Century Fox\u2019s business and strategy. Actual results could differ materially from what is said. The company\u2019s Form 10-Q for the three months ended March 31, 2015, identifies risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ and these statements are qualified by the cautionary statements contained in such fillings.","Additionally, this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measurements. The definition of, and a reconciliation of such measures, can be found in our earnings release and our 10-Q filing. Finally, please note that certain financial measures used in this call such as segment operating income before depreciation and amortization, often referred to as EBITDA, and adjusted earnings per share, are expressed on a non-GAAP basis. The GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation of these non-GAAP measures is included in our earnings release.","And with that, I\u2019m pleased to turn it over to John.","John Nallen","Thanks, Reed. Before we get into the specific earnings commentary, just a reminder that because of the sale of our DBS businesses to Sky this past November, our reported financial results for the third quarter this year do not include the consolidation of these DBS businesses as compared to a full quarter consolidation a year ago. So, similar to last quarter to provide a more meaningful comparative analysis, we\u2019re providing total company adjusted revenue and adjusted EBITDA which excludes the DBS businesses in all periods.","Now, turning to the quarter results. Third quarter total company revenues were $6.8 billion, up $84 million compared to the year-ago adjusted result, reflecting double-digit increases at our cable networks segment and mid-single-digit increases at film. This growth was mostly offset by lower television segment revenues where the prior year results included approximately $350 million in revenues from the broadcast of the Super Bowl.","Total segment EBITDA for the third quarter was $1.68 billion, a 3% reduction versus the adjusted EBITDA from a year ago of $1.73 billion. This year\u2019s result reflects continued strong underlying cable networks segment contributions and higher film segment contributions. These increases were more than offset by reduced television segment results reflecting last year\u2019s Super Bowl broadcast, as well as this year\u2019s impact of the investments in our new sports channels in India.","Additionally, this quarter reflected the most unfavorable year-on-year comparison so far of foreign exchange rates, and as a result, our overall total EBITDA growth rate was reduced by approximately seven percentage points in the quarter. From a bottom-line perspective, on a GAAP basis, we reported income from continuing operations attributable to stockholders of $990 million as compared to the $1.07 billion we reported a year ago. Equity earnings were $160 million higher than a year ago, primarily reflecting this year\u2019s inclusion of our share of Sky\u2019s gain on the sale of Sky Bet.","Excluding the net income effects of other net, as well as certain adjustments to equity earnings including eliminating the gain on the Sky Bet sale and eliminating last year\u2019s gain from participating in Sky share repurchase program, third quarter adjusted earnings per share were $0.42 this year versus $0.47 in the prior year.","Now, let me provide some comments on the performance at our businesses. Let\u2019s start with the cable networks where total segment revenues increased 14% from last year, highlighted by a 15% increase in affiliate revenues and 9% advertising revenue growth. With respect to affiliate revenues, domestic affiliate fees increased 20% primarily from higher average rates led by the RSNs, FX, and Fox News as well as increases from the conversion of our new channels, FS1 and FXX. The inclusion of the YES Network for the full quarter this year also contributed to our growth. Excluding the contribution from YES, we had a mid-teens domestic affiliate fee increase.","Our reported international affiliate fees were up 2%, reflecting an underlying mid-teens local currency growth rate, which was mostly offset by unfavorable foreign exchange movements particularly in Latin America and in Europe.","The 9% total cable ad revenue growth in the quarter was led by our international channels where reported international advertising grew 24%, reflecting 29% growth on a local currency basis. This growth was primarily driven by increases at STAR from this year\u2019s broadcast of the ICC World Cup. The third quarter domestic advertising revenues were at similar levels to a year ago, with increases at the sports networks, Fox News, and FXX, essentially being offset by lower ad revenues at FX and the National Geographic Channel due to lower ratings.","Total cable segment EBITDA in the third quarter of $1.23 billion was up 5% over the prior year, reflecting the solid revenue growth which was partially offset by a planned 19% increase in expenses primarily related to higher sports rights and entertainment programming costs. Around 60% of the increase in expenses came from STAR Sports, most notably the cost of the Cricket World Cup rights. The negative comparative effect from the strengthening U.S. dollar impacted the segment growth rate by around 5%.","EBITDA at our domestic cable channels increased 21% from higher contributions at Fox News and from our sports channels including the impact of consolidating the YES Network for the full quarter. This EBITDA growth was partially offset by lower contributions from the FX Networks due to increased programming costs. At the international channels, despite local currency growth at FIC, our reported international channel EBITDA contributions declined 60%, driven by both the sizable planned cricket investment we made at STAR Sports as well as the overall negative impact from foreign exchange rates especially from Latin America.","At our Television segment, third quarter EBITDA was $141 million, roughly half the contribution generated in the third quarter a year ago. This decline principally reflects the absence of the revenue and earnings from the Super Bowl broadcast in the prior year, as well as higher entertainment programming cost this year from a higher volume of original series including Glee and Empire. Excluding last year\u2019s Super Bowl, segment revenues were consistent with the year-ago quarter as strong retransmission consent revenue growth was offset by a 7% decline in ad revenues due to lower general entertainment ratings at the broadcast network.","Turning to our film segment, we reported third quarter EBITDA of $382 million, an 8% increase over year ago results as higher film studio contributions more than offset lower television production results and the unfavorable impacts of foreign currency. Total segment revenues in the quarter increased $110 million or 5%, driven by several successful theatrical releases including Kingsman and Taken 3 as well as home entertainment revenues from Rio 2 and The Fault in Our Stars. The reduced contributions from television production are largely due to lower SVOD revenues this year, reflecting last year\u2019s multi-series sale to Amazon, which included 24 and The Americans.","Now, before I turn to guidance, let me make a couple of capital-related comments. We ended the quarter with $9.3 billion in cash and $19.1 billion in gross debt. These balances reflect strong cash generation from operating activities in the quarter alone of approximately $1.8 billion and share repurchases in the quarter of $2.1 billion. Subsequent to the quarter, we continued to actively repurchase shares. From July 1 through today, we have repurchased approximately $5.250 billion of Fox A shares and we have approximately $1.25 billion remaining on our current authorization. So we\u2019re on plan to complete the $6 billion buyback within the 12-month timeframe that we previously announced.","Now, let me address our guidance update for fiscal 2015, and as a reminder, for guidance purposes, we are excluding the DBS businesses for the entirety of all periods, resulting in a base EBITDA for fiscal 2014 of $6.29 billion. On our last quarter\u2019s earnings call, we indicated that the strengthening dollar would have an adverse impact on our EBITDA growth for the year based on exchange rates at that time. Since that call, the dollar on average has continued to strengthen, although in recent days it\u2019s begun to weaken against certain currencies. So this volatility makes it difficult to forecast with precision the impact on our results, but we estimate that foreign exchange rates could have up to an incremental one percentage point negative impact on our growth rate.","Absent this potential impact, we are maintaining our guidance for our total segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2015 to be at the lower end of the mid-single-digit range above the $6.29 billion total segment EBITDA base level for fiscal 2014.","With that, let me turn it over to Chase.","Charles Carey","Thanks, John. Our results continue to be driven by competitive strength in our cable networks, strong affiliate fee growth, and leadership in our content businesses, while we face headwinds due to both foreign currency and the turnaround efforts at our broadcast business. Our third quarter results were further impacted by the absence of the Super Bowl this year and significant investments at STAR Sports in India, particularly the Cricket World Cup. We will address our guidance for the next fiscal year on our year-end call in August, therefore I want to use the next few minutes to address some specific issues.","As I noted a minute ago, we continue to have strong underlying growth at our cable channels driven by higher affiliate fees. We also continue to close agreements that meet or exceed our expectations for new and existing agreements. At the same time, there\u2019s increasing noise in the market about new over-the-top offers, skinny bundles and other new options for consumers to access content. It is important to provide a bit of insight when considering these issues. First, we believe the current pay TV ecosystem is strong and the consumers continue to value choice and breadth in content. While we\u2019re seeing a small decline in pay TV subs, we believe the vast majority of customers will continue to want a bundle of channels that is priced appropriately as opposed to a limited number of premium priced channels.","Second, our existing carriage agreements are carefully constructed, and not only provide us with a fair value for our content but also specify the terms in which our channels are packaged and distributed. Many agreements provide limited flexibility for customer retention or experimentation with alternative packages. Any plans to distribute our package or channels in other ways would require a significantly different pricing structure. Even with this, we do expect there would be more choices for consumers. This means more competition for our content. It also provides us opportunities to expand our business by providing consumers a better experience in connecting with customers we may not reach today.","Not everyone will benefit from these changes. We continue to believe that content will be the ultimate beneficiary of the growth of digital platforms and that within the content world, those with must-have brands in content at scale will be the true winners. As both existing MVPDs and new entrants try to construct new consumer offers, those with broad hit content and unique brands will be best positioned to come out on top. We believe we\u2019re uniquely positioned to be such a winner. In the U.S., and increasingly internationally, we\u2019ve built our business around five key brands: Fox Sports, Fox News, FX, National Geographic, and Fox, each of which is a market leader with unique strengths.","At Fox Sports, we have locked up key local, national, and international rights well into the next decade. Our regional sports networks add a critical dimension to our sports business that truly distinguishes us. The sheer popularity of the RSNs have made that business a pillar of strength second to none for us. We\u2019ve used our scale, experience, and broad affiliate agreements to enable us to continue to grow these businesses.","Fox News and FX have also established themselves as true industry leaders. Fox News is as dominant as ever, beating CNN, MSNBC and HLN combined in primetime viewers. At the FX Networks, the quality, breadth, and distinctiveness in the programming really make it a premium channel residing in the basic cable space. Additionally, our FXX channel has essentially doubled its viewership from a year ago. National Geographic is one of the most recognized brands in the world, and while the channel is still a work in progress, we believe we haven\u2019t come close to tapping its true potential.","The Fox Networks is clearly in a turnaround on the entertainment side. Nonetheless, it continues to be a driving force with enormous upside. The sports side of the network has been further strengthened this year by adding the FIFA World Cup and US Open Golf to our portfolio of NFL, MLB, and NASCAR events. On the entertainment side, this season\u2019s Gotham and more recently Empire give us momentum as we head into next week\u2019s upfront and Dana Walden and Gary Newman have given the business a fresh energy and excitement. We\u2019re not the first broadcast network to fight through a turnaround, and we\u2019re confident we\u2019re on our way.","The breadth and strength of our brands and content are also going to be critical as we navigate the changes to the advertising side of our business. Our product has never seen such demand. However, we don\u2019t yet have the ability to effectively monetize the growing viewership. We also need to realize that consumers in a digital world are not going to be captive viewers that will sit through 16 minutes of ads an hour. Advertising will have to be more effective and engaging to justify a premium. We\u2019ll need to work more closely with advertisers to connect with consumers in ways they value and enjoy. Both the recent re-organization of our channels ad sales group and our true[X] acquisition are steps in this direction.","There\u2019ll be short-term challenges such as those we\u2019re experiencing today in the advertising side of our business, which can create pressure as we work to develop new business models. However, for those that navigate this transition successfully, the media industry that emerges on the other side will be one with enormous growth potential and an incredibly exciting future. One of the keys to success will be the ability to be disciplined in the face of industry noise and to be willing to invest and build on positions of strength even in the face of uncertain times. This is a time to prioritize long-term gains over short-term pain. We need to resist the temptation to react to short-term disruptions by weakening our long-term future.","In many ways, this is a time to double down. We must also continue to invest aggressively in original content. Many have asked if the current level of original content production is sustainable. The obvious answer is that it is if we create the best content. We contend the winners in the content world will be those with the management and infrastructure to maximize the value of that content. Our proven track record, management bench strength, deep roster of talent relationships, unique library, and world-wide set of industry-leading networks will enable us to monetize content second to none.","We also need to control a much wider set of rights to the content we distribute. The days of slicing and dicing rights are over. In order to create the best consumer experience and maximize the value of our content and networks, we need to have the flexibility to come to the broadest set of rights. The best path to controlling our own destiny is to create our own product. We will clearly continue to work with third parties, but the sweet spot is undoubtedly where we own and distribute our own content. Our leadership position in content gives us a big advantage in achieving that goal.","In closing, we believe we\u2019re incredibly well positioned and are confident that today\u2019s challenges represent real opportunities in the future. Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Chase. Operator, now we\u2019d like to go to the Q&A where Chase...","Operator","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","...James and John will be happy to take questions.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of John Janedis with Jefferies. Please go ahead.","John Janedis","Thank you. Chase, last quarter, you were fairly measured on the ad outlook for traditional medium. Now that we\u2019re further into the year, has your outlook changed at all? And is there any sense that some of the money that shifted over to digital may be coming back to TV due to some issues with ROI or reach?","Charles Carey","I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s - there\u2019s a dramatic change. Probably - the ad markets probably were a little better in April. I mean, right now you have the quiet that always exists sort of before the upfront. So it\u2019s sort of heading into the upfront and tough to judge right now. But I think they are okay. I mean, clearly, we\u2019re going through a transition here. Advertisers, without a doubt, have more choices. They want more flexibility in some ways. You can say the upfront we\u2019re about to go into, while important, is probably a bit of an antiquated practice given where the world is heading. I think advertisers want more flexibility. I think for us I think it\u2019s increasingly important. That\u2019s why we restructured our group that we really work with advertisers to figure out how do we create unique opportunities with unique messages that resonate.","I think there\u2019s a degree more energy in it, but again, I think everybody is still trying to navigate this new space. There\u2019s no question everybody wants the attributes that are associated with the digital world. I think in some ways, the promise is ahead of the reality, and I think some of that reality has got to get fleshed out and people have to understand we have to do a better job of prioritizing, monetizing that viewership. I mean, we have taken steps. Certainly, it\u2019s become a not immaterial part of our business, but it\u2019s got to get - we\u2019re in the middle of the first inning of what we need to do in terms of monetizing [ph] that and we need to develop the capabilities to do it. But a lot of it is prioritizing focus and working with these advertisers to develop the right messages and the right communications for those advertisers.","John Janedis","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, John. Okay, next question, please?","Operator","That will come from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thanks. I was actually thinking about that advertising question and how different the upfront will be this year. And I was just wondering as an add-on, how are you guys approaching it given - I mean, there\u2019s obviously the measurement issues, but you also - what will the currency be? Do you think you\u2019ll be more cross-platform? How does programmatic play into it this year? And then since you restructured your ad division, do you think that most of the deals will be across broadcast and cable?","Charles Carey","I think, again, these changes usually are more incremental. I mean, people [indiscernible] the world is going to be, but people have to do business short-term. So I think the changes will be more incremental in nature, but clearly, we know the direction its heading. I think all those things will be a bigger factor than they have been in the past, but it\u2019s going to take time. Again, in a lot of ways we haven\u2019t developed a lot of the capabilities, not just measurement but technology and other things to measure the effectiveness, capabilities, deliver on the promise of it.","We\u2019re better than we were, but it\u2019s still really early days. So I think all those things will be a part of it, certainly all the trends you talk in currency. We need to - clearly, C3, we said before, isn\u2019t the answer and C7 isn\u2019t the answer. They\u2019re all directionally the answer of starting to measure the viewership outside the linear network, but we\u2019ve got a long, long way to go to really monetize every viewership in every shape and form we can to work clearly with the reorganization to work with advertisers to find ways.","I think certainly, we will be much more working across, I mean, the purpose of putting our ad sales together was to sell across our platforms and in many ways if we\u2019re going to create unique relationships with advertisers, what we want to do is use the unique franchises we have across the breadth of them. That\u2019s how we create something that really takes advantage of our unique content and brands is to give an advertiser an ability to access customers across all our franchises and to develop then unique messages that resonate.","Again, I think it\u2019s increasingly important we find ways to make advertising not an encumbrance to consumers but sort of a value-add and part of the experience. That\u2019s part of what true[X] brings to us is an ability to make the advertising experience one that is more valued and part of the value just comes from making it more relevant. But all those things have to be part of directionally where we\u2019re going. We\u2019re obviously not going to get there in the next two months, but certainly we expect to make steps and in all honesty, we\u2019ve made steps to date but we have a long, long way to go.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Okay. Super quick follow-up. The sports quest, now that cricket the - the Indian cricket is done, is this the last of the big increases, or is there one more to go overall?","John Nallen","We\u2019ll have an increase next quarter as well with the - this is across cable overall with the increase of the Women\u2019s World Cup and the US Open.","Charles Carey","And I think in cricket, actually, they\u2019re - we\u2019ve got - we\u2019re going over our budget meetings. I think the Indian leadership is in next week, so we\u2019ll see. Their agreements are structured that some ways depends on what events are coming, so I\u2019m actually not fluent. So we\u2019ll actually get a bit more visibility going forward next week on what they think is coming and where it\u2019s going because unlike the U.S. or the NFL, you got 16 games. The schedules are more determined on an ongoing basis for a lot of the events. I mean, the World Cup is planned, but the national team country on country and some of the other big events are sort of evolved over time. So we\u2019ll get a better sense of that next week.","Jessica Reif Cohen","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Jessica. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. That will come from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank.","Bryan Kraft","Hi. Thank you. Just two questions. Chase, I know you said you wanted to address the guidance on the next call. But you did talk about a mid-$7 billion target for EBITDA for fiscal 2016 on your last call. I guess I was just wondering what the confidence level is in still achieving that kind of number for next year and then also had a follow-up question on advertising. What specifically are you seeing on scatter pricing right now, if you could talk about that? And do you see C7 as being the predominant currency and does that even matter, or do you end up just with lower pricing on C7 versus C3? Thank you.","Charles Carey","Right. I guess in terms of the guidance, as I said, we really - we do plan to address that at year-end. We\u2019re just beginning our budget reviews now. I mean, actually the first budget meeting is later this week, so we haven\u2019t even had the first one. And as you get closer to it, we\u2019ve got to get a handle on - there will be things that impact the budgets such as the ongoing strength of the dollar. We\u2019ll have better visibility into that, updated views on the ad markets as opposed to the upfronts, specifics in our content release schedule, level of investments in content, all those things will come through.","So, yeah, I think we\u2019ve historically, which is why we give the guidance sort of at year-end after we\u2019ve gone through the budget process to get a handle on it, and I think that\u2019s probably where we\u2019re going to stick with it. Scatter market, I mean, I think the pricing has actually been pretty good. I mean I think probably the volume probably is not quite as strong as pricing. But pricing is actually, in the scatter markets, been pretty good. I think in terms of currency, I\u2019m not going to predict C3 versus C7. I think probably the second part of your question is probably more relevant. I mean, it matters, but at the end of the day, I think neither one is the answer and there\u2019ll probably be some dynamics of pricing factored into what you put into it.","What we need to do is make it a priority to monetize viewership, all the viewership that\u2019s occurring, which is why neither C3 nor C7 is the answer. To some degree, this product has to have - really almost to be sold in a different way. It has to be sold on a premium basis, I mean not just [ph] cumulating up with what we\u2019re selling linearly. We need to [ph] different parts of the world are going to have - it\u2019s going to have a different ad loads and going to have different advertising messages with different capabilities that hopefully should be much more attractive. And in some degree, we have to move to figure out how do we get paid for the premium value of the advertising that can exist in the marketplace going forward.","And things like C3 and C7, to me, are small steps, but they\u2019re not the answer. They\u2019re not irrelevant, so we do want to capture more of that viewership in the manner we can through at least reflecting the expanding viewership of all these digital platforms. But that\u2019s not the end goal. And the end goal is to figure out how do we get fairly compensated for the product that really is the product everybody wants. At the end of the day, the product that consumers and advertisers all want to deal with is our product. We need to build the capability to monetize the popularity of that viewership and again C7 is not an answer. It\u2019s is a small step in the right direction, but just a small step.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Bryan. Operator, could we have the next question, please?","Operator","Yeah, that comes from Doug Mitchelson with UBS.","Douglas Mitchelson","Thanks so much. So, Chase, at the Analyst Day, [ph] you set up two years of investing in cable networks followed by a period of strong margin expansion and we\u2019re almost at the end of that two years of investment and you went out of your way today to talk about investing to build a position of strength, time to double down, expand the business by offering better experience in reaching customers you don\u2019t reach today. And I feel like to some extent we\u2019re sort of dancing around the over-the-top strategy for the company. And what I\u2019m wondering is are you suggesting investors brace for another investment cycle stacked on the end of this last one? And what do you think we should consider Fox\u2019s over-the-top strategy likely to be going forward? Any sense of cadence around this would be helpful.","Charles Carey","Yeah, I wouldn\u2019t read more - I think probably over-reading things into it. I mean, yes, probably the investing comment if I was going to - and it\u2019s not solely speaking to this - probably is a comment first and foremost about the Fox network. I mean, clearly the Fox network, we report the broad segment, so it\u2019s not a secret. The Fox network is not where we think it should be and not where we planned for it to be. We think we\u2019ve got some nice momentum with Empire and Gotham and a couple of other things coming. We like the sports franchises we\u2019ve added.","We still look at Fox network as a business that should be the shining light that is the top of the pyramid that drives our business forward. Clearly, it\u2019s not performed as such. It\u2019s taken - its ratings declines in the last three years are not what we planned on. We\u2019re excited by the new management team. We made the changes to drive that business. So I think certainly using that as a case in point, it probably is the clearest case in point is I think we think that\u2019s a great business. And we think we need to continue to have the backbone to invest to drive that business to what it can be as opposed to saying how do we hit a profit target at the end of next year for the Fox network as opposed to investing to enable it to get to the right place three years from now?","So I think it\u2019s probably talking more about that type of investment. I think I guess the only other comment I\u2019d make is in general, and you go back to the Analyst Day, the world is fluid. I think you\u2019ve always got to be opportunistic and you\u2019ve got to make judgments as you get to various places in time as to what\u2019s the right decision, what\u2019s the competitive marketplace, what are the other industry dynamics that have occurred and how do you manage your business to build long-term value from what you know today. And certainly today and I\u2019m not - we\u2019re just starting a fact - it\u2019s not making any judgments about margins or anything else as opposed to today clearly there have been changes in the marketplace. Certainly, the impacts on ratings across cable networks have probably been larger than one would have expected a year ago, including me.","I think some of those shifts have been larger than I would have anticipated where you saw the trends coming. And I think as the world evolves, you\u2019ve got to adjust to it. And I think a lot of our businesses, I mean, things like investing in sports, FS1 is pretty much right on plan. The produced programming is still a work in process, and we are bringing a new executive we announced in to be the point person for that. We knew creating programming takes time. Some of it has worked, some of it hasn\u2019t, and we actually feel great about where it is and we\u2019re pretty much where we expected to be.","So I think in general, I think there are businesses that clearly aren\u2019t where we expected it to be, the broadcast network, obviously, the international channels have taken - they are competitively closer to where we are. The financials aren\u2019t where we expected them to be because of the currency. But more broadly, I think we are continuing to adhere to things we talked about and - but we\u2019re always going to - and I think we said it on the Analyst Day. I think you always want to - I think it\u2019s important that you continue to aggressively compete in the world as you know more as the world evolves.","I think in terms of over-the-top, I think over-the-top is a very important part of our future. Now, that being said, as I said in the prepared comments, we still think most consumers are going to want to bundle of programming. I don\u2019t think they want to buy ala carte. They want to buy a bundle of programming. We think there will be more people, more players offering bundles of programming. I think those bundles have to be ones that are concocted with the consumer in mind, not something that is artificially concocted by a big content owner and a distributor that doesn\u2019t really make sense. The alignment of what that content is doesn\u2019t make sense to a consumer.","So you have to figure out - I mean, if these over-the-top players are going to be there, what are they bringing? In many ways certainly bringing a better consumer experience, I think in some ways the Netflix and Hulus are sort of cases in point of a better - the value of a better consumer experience. And I think you can go on the flip side and say this [indiscernible] with TV Everywhere have been an example of the challenges you have when you don\u2019t create the right consumer experience.","So I think there can be over-the-top players that bring a new consumer experience that again at its core is still offering a bundle of programming and not be exactly what\u2019s out there. That\u2019s why I think you want to make sure you have must-have content that has to be in that bundle if you\u2019re creating a bundle that really resonates with that consumer and we do still think consumers want breadth and choice that we got the content that will be a central part of any of those over-the-top bundles. But I think bringing obviously the competition is good, but bringing better experiences to the marketplace if people can develop better user interfaces, that\u2019s a positive.","I always thought of DIRECTV when I was there. I mean, one of the reasons DIRECTV I think competed successfully against the cable industry was it was better experience. And I think sort of the ease of use and simplicity are probably some of the most underappreciated assets and virtues in the business. Actually, we\u2019re excited by it. Look, we\u2019ve got - we probably amongst - many of our peers have more first-hand experience in dealing directly. We have, I said, businesses internationally that deal directly with consumers that create a consumer interfaces and manage relationships with consumers. So we think over-the-top for us specifically is an interesting opportunity. We think working with third parties to create more competition and new experiences is an important opportunity.","We also think there are customers that again, I think, the predominant majority will want a bundle. I think there are consumers that probably are interested in alternatives. Everybody talks about the millennials and I think the ability to create packages or offers that they speak to that generation is also an interesting opportunity. Obviously, they\u2019re consumers. We don\u2019t reach today and we want to [indiscernible] in an additive way. I think it\u2019s important everything we do is adding to the pie, not cannibalizing the pie, create offers that speak to customers that want something different. We think that will be a relatively small minority but it\u2019s important for us to do. And we look forward to developing all of that.","Douglas Mitchelson","Makes sense. Thank you very much.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Doug. Operator, the next question, please?","Operator","That will come from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets.","David Bank","Okay. Thanks. Chase, James, John, I think it\u2019s - you got them all there. Chase [indiscernible]","Charles Carey","Reed felt left out.","David Bank","Sorry, Reed. You\u2019re in there, man. So, look, Chase, I think, has been talking a fair amount about this in a number of his comments that there has been focus on the lighter bundle. I think for us particularly on the sort of very nascent OTT MVPD side, we\u2019re trying to navigate this and we don\u2019t have much to extrapolate from. We have basically - Sling is kind of out there, Sony PlayStation Vue is out there. There\u2019s a lot of speculation around what might be on Apple. And Fox has a lot, I think, of relatively average priced must-have programming not outside the mean, the broadcast network O&Os, news, general entertainment, even national sports. But we don\u2019t really know where the RSNs fit in, and we don\u2019t have a lot of data to base them on. I guess outside of Sling and Sony, if you can talk about that. But how do you see the distribution landscape shaping up for the RSNs in an OTT MVPD world? What\u2019s your confidence that the distribution model sustains itself? Thanks.","Charles Carey","In all honesty, I don\u2019t think the - I don\u2019t look at the RSNs really as - I guess they\u2019re geographically different, so they\u2019re different [indiscernible] I think our RSNs in aggregate cover 70% of the country, so in some ways you can say the RSNs for us are a national business. And I do think that\u2019s strength in RSNs is a distinguishing feature for us against a lot of the other people, but I don\u2019t actually look at it different. I think the RSNs represent great must-have content and I think that is as important as any content that exists in a local market for a large segment of consumers. Obviously, any piece of content is relevant to everybody, but it is content second to none.","It is - and I think in some ways, I guess we judge its importance as we engage with our distributors in the marketplace. And it has continued to be a critical part of our business, a continued critical pillar of driving our business forward. Obviously, some others have stumbled in it. I think we have proven a capability - sort of the LA and Houston situation that everybody points to, we have proven a capability that we know how to manage, we know how to navigate. I think our scale helps. Most of our agreements in place are long-term. I think over 80% of our agreements are into the 20s and we know how to continue to renew them in terms that work. I think we\u2019ve renewed about 20% of our team deals in the last couple of years.","So it\u2019s a business that - and again, we bring a lot of strength to it that enables us to make these businesses work and that others on a one-off basis obviously aren\u2019t established relationships with MVPDs are all part of that. So in many ways, I just - I look at it the same way we would look at the other channels, the other channels we have, and being one, if not the most important drivers in the business. And we do think again those array of channels are going to be our must-have content for consumers out there.","James Rupert Murdoch","I think - it\u2019s James here. Just to add, David, I think it\u2019s consistent with that the overall strategy for the last number of years in the business, which has been to concentrate meaningful investment in programming, be it entertainment, news, sports, or factual programming that\u2019s arranged around really big brands and distinctiveness that really matters. I don\u2019t think we see the RSNs as a separate category from that. It\u2019s really been part and parcel of how we approach the marketplace both in the United States and in other markets as we have invested in sports around the place. And to Chase\u2019s point, the results of the RSNs and the results in our sports businesses around the world are validating that more as opposed to less.","Charles Carey","And I think in some ways the noise around the RSNs has really come off a couple of specifics. I think - single team RSNs, I don\u2019t think have been a great thing. And I think that\u2019s not really the business we have built. And there are a couple places where I think the pricing and obviously the places we passed on the cost of content. So I think you do have to be disciplined and make judgments. But I think if you manage it properly and again I think the one-team RSNs are sort of more limited phenomena that have had created a broader noise. And I think in some degree positively, some of the events the last year plus have been sobering for the business. And I think in many ways helpful in terms of sobering some of the one-team sort of open-ended euphoria.","James Rupert Murdoch","One team and single market...","Charles Carey","Yeah.","James Rupert Murdoch","...which is hard.","David Bank","Okay. Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, David. Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","Next we\u2019ll go to the line of Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael Nathanson","Thank you. I have one for Chase. Let me focus this question on U.S. cable networks. And if we look at cost growth as you predicted at your Investor Day, the past two years have been a period of investment spending with double digit cable cost growth. We wonder now you\u2019re almost done with that investment cycle, what\u2019s the right way to think about cost growth domestically at cable going forward? Because in the past before the cycle started, you guys were mid to high single digit expense growers, so that\u2019s I think one of the questions people want to get is what\u2019s normalized spending post the investment cycle?","Charles Carey","I think if you\u2019re - I mean, I think if everything was ordinary course, obviously again our broadcast network is not where we want it to be. So - but if you said the cable networks, I think probably back to that is probably sort of what you\u2019d expect. And again, we\u2019ve sort of had the ramp-up in sports and the ramp-up to take FX from one to two networks. But I think once you get past that, I think what you have before is sort of what it comes back to. And again, that\u2019s dependent on the new opportunities. Obviously, they\u2019ll dictate new plans. But just in the world as defined as it is today, it probably goes back to where it was.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Let me ask you about buybacks, because I think if you go back and look at the $2 billion plus you spent this quarter, maybe the highest buyback quarter almost ever [indiscernible] News Corp., and given that you have $9 billion of cash in your books and you accelerated to this quarter, what does that say about your goal for the next couple years on buybacks? Is $6 billion the right run rate, or can we expect given the stock prices and the cash generation that you\u2019ll start accelerating the rate of buyback?","Charles Carey","No. Look, I mean, we\u2019re not going to make predicted comments at buyback. I think we\u2019ve said and we\u2019re going to continue to hear. Pretty much we\u2019ll address the next buyback when we get through this buyback, and we\u2019ll address it with the board before obviously year-end, and we\u2019ll announce what we plan to do on the year-end call. But we\u2019re not going to get ahead of the board. That\u2019s a cycle we\u2019re in and a cycle we\u2019re going to stick with.","Michael Nathanson","Okay. Thanks.","Charles Carey","Thanks.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Michael. Next question, please?","Operator","Thank you. That will be from Alexia Quadrani with JPMorgan.","Alexia Quadrani","Hi. Thank you. When you look at your hit shows like Empire, Gotham, can you give us some color on how much you think you can leverage those hits in the upfront in terms of getting better pricing across your lineup? And also now that you have a better sense of what the lineup is for next year, I guess, any color on how we should think about programming expense in broadcast network next year?","Charles Carey","I\u2019m not going to put a number to them. Look, I guess what is clearly true in today\u2019s world is hits are more valuable than ever. Sort of second rate product is - mediocre product is less valuable, and hits are more valuable than they have ever been. So when you get a phenomena like Empire, it\u2019s great. It obviously is a product that with all the platforms and all the abilities to access content we ever want, it in many ways becomes must-have content for consumers. So it\u2019s tremendously important. I\u2019m not going to - hits. Hits just continued to increase in importance.","Look, we\u2019re excited. We\u2019ll have this - I\u2019m not going to get, what, five days from now the whole schedule will be out where we couldn\u2019t be more excited by it. Dana and Gary obviously bring an incredible track record to the business. They\u2019ve proven themselves over a decade plus at the studio side. And I think we really will have some exciting things to talk about on Monday, and I\u2019ll let them sort of address them.","Alexia Quadrani","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Thanks, Alexia. Next question, please?","Operator","It will come from Tim Nollen with Macquarie.","Tim Nollen","Hi. Thanks. I wanted to dig in a little bit to your international networks. A lot of the questions here have been focused a bit more on the U.S. side, but understanding the cricket investments that you\u2019ve made recently and how that\u2019s gone for you, could you possibly break out between STAR and FIC? Kind of what proportion of your incremental costs are on sports versus non-sports programming? I guess what I\u2019m getting at is other than knowing that the Cricket World Cup and these other big sporting events have been major focuses for you, what more is to be done on general entertainment programming and how should we think about the cost base for your investments in your international networks there, please?","John Nallen","Well, on the international side, clearly the ramp-up in costs on those channels have been in sports. And that\u2019s actually true of both FIC and STAR, but most notably at STAR. As Chase said, as we look forward in India, in particular, there\u2019s - there will be more cricket investment as the BCCI determines its tournaments. But we\u2019ll continue - I don\u2019t think the expectation in India on the entertainment side should be a massive or very significant increase in the programming investment on the entertainment side, but at FIC, we continue a strategy of investing in those networks. So FIC will continue to see programming increases on the entertainment side.","James Rupert Murdoch","And I just - it\u2019s James here. I think as well just in terms of how those investments have gone, I think over the last little while as we have really bedded in the acquisition of the sports networks, ESPN\u2019s shared STAR - in ESPN, STAR Sports as well as the Pan-American sports business in South America, it\u2019s really added a new dimension to all of the international channels businesses including FIC and STAR. And it has done well, and even though the investment in cricket, for example, has been very - it\u2019s been heavy, the results have been tremendous. And we\u2019ve seen record viewership. We saw an incredible, from an audience perspective, some really incredible results, and that\u2019s particularly in India over 600 million viewers for the World Cup.","And also that\u2019s a real platform to build new sports off of as well. So in the last year, investment not just in cricket but in kabaddi, in domestic professional football, I\u2019d say soccer, in India. And the investment in sports across Asia and Latin America has been very, very effective both with our affiliates but also with advertisers and most importantly for customers.","Tim Nollen","Great. So it sounds like from - also tying in a previous comment you made that you\u2019re very happy with the state of progress for your national networks, STAR and FIC, both with heavy sports costs, I don\u2019t want to say done, but a lot of that being done in that last year or two. Is it safe to say it\u2019s a smoother investment process from here?","James Rupert Murdoch","I think it\u2019s - I think the - as you look at over the next couple of years, you see the ramp-up kind of normalize.","Tim Nollen","Yeah.","James Rupert Murdoch","And we\u2019ll see in particular where we have a real investment of loss on the sports business in India that normalizes, you really start to expose the underlying profitability of the entertainment business. And that\u2019s really what drives the sort of double benefit as that goes towards much greater profitability. The other regions are less pronounced with respect to that shift.","Charles Carey","Look, I guess I\u2019d also say because when you talk about sort of, I mean, in some ways it almost sounds like [indiscernible] maturing and the reverse is true. I mean, If you go to a place like Asia in general, India in many ways, but sports is giving us an ability to play a bigger role in shaping the whole marketplace, and so the whole digitalization, defining of packages, how you sell, how you get paid, how various content is offered and paid for by consumers is all still being built, I mean, in across Asia in many ways the next generation of growth is coming on these over-the-top - I mean, call them over-the-top digital platforms.","And some places like Japan sort of cable - I mean, cable matured at sort of 20% to 25% penetration and all the energy now is coming in various subscription digital platforms. So these are businesses. So, yeah, I think we have a good handle on it, but I do think it\u2019s important to understand these are - in many of these places these are businesses that are still very much in early stage growth forms, and a lot of the business models and rules and practices are all still being developed. And, again, one of the value having key content like sports is it gives us a unique role as these things are being developed. And [indiscernible] in the prepared comments, I think those things you want to make sure you\u2019re strong as those markets take shape and form and new paths evolve.","Tim Nollen","Thanks very much.","Reed Nolte","Thank you. Operator, next question, please?","Operator","We\u2019ll go to the line of Michael Morris with Guggenheim.","Michael Morris","Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Couple questions about domestic sports. One of the questions we get is about there being such an increase in inventory lately and that the demand is not there to match it on the advertising side. So would you be willing to share in the past quarter what the advertising at broadcast and at cable, what the growth looked like for your sports products versus general entertainment? And then as we look into 2016, I know that you\u2019re not giving guidance or changing the guidance, but generally speaking when you think about the operating profit outlook at the cable networks, how much of that do you expect to come from your sports businesses versus the other businesses? Thanks.","Reed Nolte","Outlook into the quarter.","Charles Carey","Well, sports, I mean, [indiscernible] sports, in general, is a - obviously, includes the RSNs and certainly, as I\u2019ve said, FS1 is pretty much on track for us. I don\u2019t know that I have a percentage. I don\u2019t want to give a percentage. I don\u2019t think we break it down like that, but certainly a significant part of the overall cable space. I think in terms of advertising, sports in general - again, it\u2019s not one size fits all. We have an array of sports. Right now, we\u2019re selling golf and the World Cup, and it\u2019s probably exceeding our expectations.","One of the benefits about sports is clearly some of the things that exist on unscripted entertainment in terms of being able to - most people don\u2019t watch live sports three days later. So some of the - and to some degree there aren\u2019t a lot of substitutions. If you want to watch the Women\u2019s World Cup or the US Open and there isn\u2019t really a second choice that\u2019s going to satisfy if you don\u2019t watch that. So I think those attributes have stood the test of time pretty well. I don\u2019t actually and I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s obviously been some expansion in the NFL adding Thursday night. I\u2019m not sure I guess going beyond that. I\u2019m trying to think what would be the real expansion in sports inventory in the marketplace.","James Rupert Murdoch","I mean, other than just news sports channels, [indiscernible] events. It\u2019s the reason we invest in premium events that deliver those unique mass audiences is because we think they continue to maintain their premium price and there\u2019s a lot of demand for them.","Charles Carey","Yeah, we have more sports inventory, but to some degree it\u2019s not new inventory. I mean, the US Open was in the marketplace, so we may be selling more inventory. But I don\u2019t think from a marketplace perspective you\u2019d look at it in the same way. And I think sports continues to distinguish itself pretty well. Different sports are in different - not one size fits all obviously - the different stories surround different sports.","John Nallen","Michael, it\u2019s John. Just in the quarter, realize we\u2019ll take the comp of the Super Bowl out of this, but from a broadcast side, advertising was healthy in sports. It wasn\u2019t any dramatic trend one way or the other. And then on the regionals as you probably know, such a substantial amount of that business is affiliate fee driven that advertising doesn\u2019t really move the needle one way or other on it. So...","Charles Carey","Actually, ratings [indiscernible] ratings have been great realistically, both the NBA and NHL overall probably exceeded our targets and MLB is off to both - both our national and regional MLB product to again - we\u2019ve got a lot of teams, so it\u2019s not true for all. But in general, it\u2019s off to a great start.","John Nallen","Yeah. So overall, I would characterize the sports market for us in the quarter as pretty good.","Michael Morris","Great. Thanks, guys.","Reed Nolte","Thanks, Mike. Operator, can we have the next question, please?","Operator","That will come from Anthony DiClemente with Nomura.","Anthony DiClemente","Thanks a lot. Thanks for including me for the questions. I have two. Talking about moving to over-the-top for the RSNs, I\u2019m just wondering, the rights structures seem to change a bit with the leagues. I\u2019m thinking of MLB for in-market streaming rights. And I just wanted to ask about that. I think there\u2019s been some tension between Fox Sports and MLB in terms of getting MLB games streamed in-market. And I think you guys would prefer to authenticate those games, and I think if I have it right, they would prefer to keep them open and eliminate the authentication wall. So just wondering if you could talk a little bit about that and give us a sense for what you\u2019re thinking about the value of those rights.","And then just kind of along that theme, you guys have a number of valuable and growing streaming digital properties inside the company, just as many of your big cat media peers do. I\u2019m referring to FOX NOW, FOX Sports Go, FXNOW, are any of those streaming apps gaining critical mass where it might make sense for you guys to give us more disclosure around users, growth in users, hours watched; things like that, things that might be helpful to us in order to maybe highlight the value of the viewership or just value of those businesses as they sit inside of the corporation? Thanks.","Charles Carey","On the rights issues [indiscernible] I don\u2019t think there\u2019s as much tension as you apply. Obviously, there are issues in every sports league we do business with, there\u2019s always issues you work through. Clearly, we\u2019d like to resolve - we\u2019d like to expand the offering. We have the marketplace to provide really what the experienced consumers want. We\u2019re engaged with baseball. We hope - we believe we will - and I don\u2019t think we\u2019re - we don\u2019t have these dramatically different views or plans as you imply. I\u2019m not going to get too deep into it. I\u2019d just say we\u2019re actively engaged, and I think we\u2019re confident we and baseball will get to a place that works for both of us and enables us to bring to consumers the experience they want. And - but it\u2019s - sometimes these things take time. But we are working on it.","Anthony DiClemente","Okay.","James Rupert Murdoch","And on your second question which is about disclosure around the digital assets and performance metrics there, I think some of it kind of goes back to some questions that we addressed earlier on in this call around currency, around what metrics and measurements are going to be important and are going to emerge not just for us but for the industry. I do think we see very, very encouraging audience growth on the digital side of the business both in terms of authenticated streaming apps like you mentioned Fox.com, FOX NOW, FXNOW, and so on. And also our joint venture with Disney and Comcast, Hulu is really experiencing some great growth and is really monetizing high quality video views in new extended Windows that we think are very - that we think is very, very encouraging.","So I think we will get to a place probably pretty soon where we will want to talk more regularly about some of those metrics. But the definition of those metrics between what advertisers care about, what we care about, what the ad products are and how we measure and report streams, hours, unique viewers, et cetera, are all things that we\u2019re kind of nutting through right now.","Reed Nolte","Thank you, Anthony.","Anthony DiClemente","Got you. Thank you.","Reed Nolte","Operator, I think we have time for one last question.","Operator","Yeah. And we\u2019ll go to the line of David Miller with Topeka Capital Markets.","David Miller","Yeah, hey, guys. Just a question on the Big Ten network. I think this is a really special asset, and I\u2019m a little surprised you guys never call it out. I mean, it really equates to kind of a Pan-American national RSN just given all the Big Ten alumni that are out there. So would you be willing to just kind of talk up any statistics you might be willing to share on the call in terms of what the addressable market is for Big Ten alumni that are out there and what the penetration rate of the network has been thus far? My understanding is it\u2019s been a huge success with Big Ten alumni, but I\u2019m just wondering what the penetration rate has been thus far and are you getting pricing power from the MVPDs? Thanks a lot.","Charles Carey","Yeah, certainly, I mean - you\u2019re right. We don\u2019t [indiscernible] I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll disclose facts on any individual networks. It\u2019s been great. We love the Big Ten. And it\u2019s been a great relationship. The business has been a great success. Probably our most recent efforts and in some degree the Big Ten is always - sort of had two footprints. It\u2019s sort of the in-market geographies of [indiscernible] are and then the wider universe that exists out. So consumers in Florida and Arizona are obviously outside the Big Ten markets. I think we\u2019ve - the distribution has been great. I think we have achieved every goal we set out for. Our most recent initiative was to expand it northeast with [ph] rockers and Maryland coming on.","We\u2019ve essentially hit or exceeded every target we had for sort of widening out that, what I call, the in-market footprint for the Big Ten. And we think continue to be great upside for the Big Ten, continues to distinguish itself. If you look at Ohio state, if you look at March Madness, the strength and the history of those schools is just second to none, and we think that is truly a unique conference with unique institutions and a business that continues to have great upside. It continues to be an exciting growth business for us, and so certainly the lack of talking about it is not in any way, shape or form due to the lack of enthusiasm, excitement, or success we\u2019ve had.","And in many ways, it\u2019s business that I think has a long, long way to go. I think the management has done a fabulous job. I mean, the ratings they get on some of the games are just incredible. I mean, they\u2019ve got, anyway, sometimes [indiscernible] third pick in the market and they\u2019re beating better games distributed on a wider basis and have found some really revolutionary and creative ways to produce cost effectively the wide array of sports that are associated with it, developed a real following amongst some of the [indiscernible] shows they produce to support those shows. So they\u2019ve done it great. We couldn\u2019t be - we couldn\u2019t - realistically we couldn\u2019t feel more excited about it.","John Nallen","Thank you, David.","David Miller","Thank you.","Reed Nolte","At this point, we are out of time. Thank you, everybody, for joining today\u2019s call. If you have any further questions, please give me or Mike Petrie a call. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you.

Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us on what has shaped up to be a very busy day for all of you. It's my first time back on our earnings call for a number of years, and I must say it's a privilege to be back at the company in an executive capacity and on this call with you and with Reed, with John and with James.","As you know, on July 1, we formally completed a leadership transition that we have been working towards for some time. James and I both appreciate the board's confidence in us, and we are keenly aware of the responsibilities that come with it. We are extraordinarily energized to be leading the company at a time when there are so many opportunities ahead. But of course, the company finds itself in this position, thanks in very large part to Chase, who we must thank for his many years of exceptional leadership. And while Chase will no longer be joining these calls, he continues to be highly involved in many aspects of the company. His ongoing counsel is a valued asset to us.","James and I have been immersed in 21st Century Fox in all its iterations and in the broader industry generally for at least the past 25 years. This background and context will serve us well as we partner to lead 21st Century Fox through a time of accelerated industry change. I can assure you that we, the board and the senior management team are intensely focused on the array of opportunities that are emerging for 21st Century Fox and for our shareholders.","Now while there has been a particular emphasis on it recently, the reality is that our industry has always been evolving and innovating. The imperative is how we respond to it. Every aspect of our business is being affected by increasingly rapid change from how we develop content, to delivery, to consumer engagement, and of course, to how we monetize it all. The scale and speed of this change will, to some, be overwhelming. But a key underlying trend is important to recognize here.","More people are now watching more quality storytelling than ever. They are just consuming it differently, given the growing array of options available to them. This is a key and positive trend. Empowered by new technologies, our customers are demanding distinct and better ways to consume our content, personalized to them in a variety of new non-linear environments. These new viewing experiences bring with them both new challenges, which we do not underestimate, but also significant opportunities for viewers, advertisers and distributors that simply have not been possible in the linear world.","These challenges and opportunities are forefront in our mind as we develop and execute over-the-top distribution and advertising strategies. One thing is very clear to us. In this environment, it is not enough to simply adapt to change. To succeed in this environment, we must lead change. And that is what all of us in the senior team are committed to do. But we also understand that linear viewing remains a key driver of our channels business, which in turn, is a direct result of our continuing commitment to finding and investing in the best content and content creators around the world. This commitment will not diminish under the new management structure, and if anything, will increase. Sport and news are also more important than ever in the linear world. Fox Sports, specifically Fox Sports 1, is showing strong viewing momentum as Fox News also continues to deliver dominant ratings.","Our goal has been and remains to simplify our business and focus on the content, the brand, and the markets that are most valuable to our customers and to our shareholders. We separated 21st Century Fox News Corp to drive value and focus. We merged the Skys into one entity and we consolidated strategic minority investments, including YES Network, ESPN STAR Sports, Fox Pan-American Sports, Asianet and MAA TV.","We refocused our channels in the key global brands of scale Fox, Fox Sports, FX, Fox News, Nat Geo and STAR and launched several new channels in support of this effort, including Fox Sports I, FXX and STAR Sports.","Internationally, we concentrated our investments to develop further depth and leadership in India and Latin America, key emerging markets with substantial growth opportunities. We've also sought to be opportunistic in maximizing the value and position of some of our businesses. For example, with the merger of Shine with Endemol creating the Endemol Shine Group, the world's leading independent producer of content and IP.","As a result of this work, we feel 21st Century Fox today is well positioned to succeed in today's dynamic media market as a global content creator and distributor. Despite the changes in our industry, you should not expect any seismic shift in our areas of focus, or in the direction of travel of the company.","Operationally, we have consistently over delivered on our affiliate revenue plan, met our expectations on content monetization, but have fallen short in advertising revenue growth, while also absorbing significant foreign exchange headwinds.","James will comment further on our intense focus around creative excellence and storytelling, the consumer experience, and on our operating strength and execution. But on the point of financial strength, I did want to underscore our ongoing commitment to having 21st Century Fox in a strong financial position to pursue opportunities while providing appropriate levels of shareholder returns.","As we look to deploy our capital for growth, we continue to have a strong bias towards building, not buying. We spent the last several years simplifying our portfolio and increasing the focus on what will drive incremental value. As we look at our portfolio businesses today, we don't see material gaping holes. But that's not to suggest that we won't pursue compelling opportunities. There may be opportunities to strengthen existing businesses with bolt-on acquisitions such as our investment in MAA TV in India, or to acquire and develop new capabilities, particularly in digital advertising and digital video generally, such as for example, our true[X] acquisition. These will require investment from time-to-time, and we will be both opportunistic and disciplined as we evaluate the landscape. Just as we have been in the past.","Our record on delivering capital return to shareholders is solid. In fact, by the end of fiscal 2016, we will have returned in excess of $24 billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends over a five-year period. This represents nearly 200% of free cash flow over that same period. This includes the $5 billion share repurchase authorization we announced today, which we intend to complete within the next 12 months.","Our commitment to deliver value to our shareholders is not just a statement. My father, James, and I are not only the leaders of this company; we are also among its most committed, most long-term, and largest shareholders. As such, our interests are directly aligned with our investors. That is, to focus on capturing the opportunities from the strength of our assets to further drive long-term stockholder value.","And with that, I'll hand it over to John and James.","John P. Nallen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Thanks, Lachlan. It's John and good afternoon. At the outset I'll remind you that because of the sale this past November of our DBS businesses to Sky, our reported financial results for the year and for the fourth quarter are not like-to-like. So to continue to present a more meaningful comparison, we are providing and commenting on, total company adjusted revenue and EBITDA, which excludes the DBS businesses in all periods.","So let me start with the full year results. For the full year, total company adjusted revenues were $27 billion up 3% over last year, driven by double-digit revenue growth in the cable segment, partially offset by comparisons against the prior year, which included the Super Bowl revenues in the television segment and a full year of Shine in the film segment.","Total segment full-year adjusted EBITDA was $6.49 billion, 3% higher than a year ago, reflecting higher contributions from our cable and film segments, partially offset by lower results at the television segment. Overall, we had a 6% negative impact on our EBITDA growth rate from foreign currency effects.","Reported net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders this year was $8.4 billion or $3.93 per share on a reported basis. This includes $4.2 billion of income reflected as other net, which largely relates to the gain from the sale of the DBS businesses to Sky, and also includes approximately $800 million of charges recorded in the fourth quarter, of which approximately half relates to programming inventory that will no longer be aired and contract termination costs for the canceled CLT20 Indian cricket tournament.","The majority of the balance represents charges from the disposition of certain pension liabilities. Additionally, this year's equity earnings of affiliate results include income of approximately $600 million, primarily related to Sky's gains on their sales of certain investments, partially offset by their amortization and other expenses related to the acquisition of Sky Italia and SkyD. Excluding the net income effects in both years of amounts reported in other net as well as the equity earnings adjustments, adjusted earnings per share were $1.72 compared to the adjusted year ago result of $1.55.","And now let me cover the fourth quarter results. Fourth quarter adjusted revenues decreased by $635 million to $6.2 billion, as continued growth at the cable networks was more than offset by lower revenue at the film and television segments. Total segment adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter was $1.54 billion, a 5% decline from a year ago, which reflects lower contributions of the film and television segments and a negative six percentage point impact from foreign exchange. From a bottom-line perspective, making similar adjustments as in the annual results, fourth quarter adjusted EPS was $0.39 this year, down $0.03 from the comparable $0.42 last year.","Now, touching on the main segments, we'll start with the cable networks, where revenues in the fourth quarter increased 7% from last year, highlighted by an overall 8% increase in affiliate revenues and 4% advertising growth. Domestic affiliate revenues increased 12%, primarily from higher average rates. Our reported international affiliate revenues were down 2%, but we had local currency growth of approximately 9%.","The fourth quarter cable segment advertising revenue growth was led by international advertising increases of 14% driven by STAR. The negative impact from foreign exchange was essentially offset by the first-time inclusion of Fox Turkey in our FIC results. Domestic advertising was 2% lower than the prior year, as increases at Fox Sports 1 were offset by declines at FX, which had fewer original programming hours versus the prior year.","Total cable segment EBITDA in the fourth quarter of $1.22 billion was up 1% over the prior year. Increases at our international channels were mostly offset by an expected decline at our domestic channels from higher sports costs as a result of new events, including the NASCAR Sprint Cup races, the U.S. Open golf tournament and the Women's World Cup. Overall, expenses at the cable segment increased by 10% in the quarter, largely due to these new events at Fox Sports 1. The negative comparative effect from foreign exchange impacted the segment EBITDA growth rate by approximately 4%.","At our television segment, fourth quarter EBITDA was $113 million as compared to $145 million in the prior year. This largely reflects 14% lower advertising revenues from lower entertainment ratings, as well as higher sports programming costs due to the network broadcast of the U.S. Open and Women's World Cup, and this was all partially offset by continued retransmission consent revenue growth.","Turning to our film segment, we reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $269 million, a 21% decline from last year. Revenues in the quarter decreased 32% due to the absence of Shine and difficult revenue comparisons to the prior year, which included the blockbuster releases of X-Men: Days of Future Past and Rio 2.","The EBITDA decline primarily reflects the absence of Shine's results, slightly lower TV production contributions and unfavorable impacts from foreign exchange.","So that closes out the comments on fiscal 2015. Let me comment on our outlook for fiscal 2016 total segment EBITDA growth, and consistent with our previous guidance practice, we're starting with a fiscal 2015 base-year EBITDA of the $6.49 billion we just reported, which excludes the DBS segment contributions.","Now from a summary level, fiscal 2016 is projected to be a year of continuing strong growth at our cable segment. Challenging comparisons at our film segment due to the timing of major releases and a continuation of the programming and marketing initiatives in support of ratings recovery at the television segment.","Now let me provide additional segment details. Our cable segment will lead the fiscal 2016 growth, driven by low double-digit affiliate fee increases led by the U.S. As we've commented on previously, our rate of expense growth will moderate in fiscal 2016 to about half the high teens rate experienced in the previous two fiscal years and this growth will be generally led by contractual step-ups in sports rights and entertainment and digital investments at STAR.","So considering these factors coupled with the impact of foreign exchange rates, we expect the cable segment fiscal 2016 EBITDA growth rate to be in the mid-teens range with underlying double-digit EBITDA growth rate in both the domestic and international channel portfolios. Foreign exchange is expected to have an approximate 2% negative impact within this growth rate.","Turning to the television segment; we're expecting a double-digit increase in retransmission consent revenues, while ad revenues are expected to be in line with fiscal 2015. Expenses are anticipated to increase in the mid-single digit range, led by planned increases in our national sports contracts and by slightly higher marketing investments at the Fox Network to support new series. As a result, we expect overall television EBITDA to be essentially flat with fiscal 2015.","At the Filmed Entertainment segment, while we're very excited about the upcoming release slate, the timing impact of three tentpole releases will impact EBITDA comparisons versus fiscal 2015. Specifically at the end of the fiscal year, we will release the sequels to X-Men and Independence Day, and in early July, Ice Age 5. The schedule will result in the recognition of significant releasing and pre-releasing costs in fiscal 2016, while the bulk of the EBITDA benefit from these films falls in fiscal 2017.","Primarily as a result of this comparative release scheduled headwind and factoring in the impact of foreign exchange, we expect the Filmed Entertainment segment EBITDA to be around $200 million below the fiscal 2015 result we just reported.","So as we roll it all up and based on all of the assumptions inherent in our projections, we are anticipating total company segment EBITDA percentage growth rate for fiscal 2016 to be in the mid-single digit range above the $6.49 billion base level for fiscal 2015.","This range anticipates a negative 3% impact from foreign currency headwinds using current rates. Now six months ago we indicated that we expected our fiscal 2016 results to be in the mid-$7 billion range and our outlook today is below that level. The primary factors causing this change have been noted publicly, including headwinds from foreign exchange and film releasing timing, further sports and digital investments in India to support long-term growth and an updated view of the ad markets.","Regarding the remainder of the income statement, there are two items I'd call out to you for fiscal 2016. First our equity earnings of affiliates will be impacted as compared to fiscal 2015 due to the costs from Hulu strategic growth initiative to ramp up their programming investment. Second, our tax rate is expected to increase to a more normalized rate in the low 30% range.","And finally, turning to cash flow and capital allocation, we ended the fiscal year with $8.4 billion in cash and approximately $19 billion in debt. We expect around the same level of working capital requirements in fiscal 2016 as we just had in fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2016 a contributor to this will be the temporary buildup of receivables from billings associated with those summer releases I just mentioned, and they will be collected in the early weeks of fiscal 2017.","Additionally, we'll fund several investments in fiscal 2016, including the purchase of MAA TV in India, Hulu and DraftKings funding, and payments to terminate the CLT20 contract in India, which we assumed in the ESS acquisition.","With regard to the buyback program that we announced a year ago, we've now fully executed that program and bought back $6 billion of Fox A shares during the last year. And as Lachlan mentioned, today we announced a new $5 billion share buyback authorization, which we intend to complete within the next 12 months.","As we look to the efficiency of our balance sheet, our cash and leverage targets have not changed. We continue to target maintaining a $2 million to $3 billion cash balance, and a gross leverage ratio of 2.5 times to 3 times. Given the level of shareholder returns, and our investment capital, by the end of fiscal 2016, we expect to be much closer to both of those targets.","And now let me turn it over to James.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks very much, John, and thanks Lachlan, and thanks, everyone, for being on the call. As we begin a new fiscal year, we're very pleased with where the business is, but of course, there's a lot of work to be done. Moving forward our overall priorities are to build upon the goals we set as a senior leadership team we formed 21 CF two years ago. First and foremost, as a creative company, we're focused on great storytelling across the business. Our continued creative execution from our partnerships with writers and producers across the spectrum at TCFTV, at FXP to our sports investments and operations at STAR Sports in India to the diverse and multi-faceted slate that we continue to develop at Fox Filmed Entertainment is the necessary ingredient to any continued and future success.","Secondly, and at the crux of the changes in our industry, we have to make sure those stories get to our customers in the most effective and compelling way possible. And that's all about ensuring a great consumer experience, both in partnership with MVPDs and over-the-top via established platforms such as Hulu or Netflix or SkyGo or by creating totally new experiences through which customers can discover and consume content, and engage with advertising.","Primarily this digital video approach is about ensuring a high-quality, on-demand and live experience, and a seamless multi-platform access approach that responds to customers' needs and meets and exceeds their expectations. These capabilities and enhancing the material in 21 CF are a large focus for the team.","Thirdly, we recognize and we relish our position as a global company with diverse and deep assets across the globe. We'll continue to focus on selective, deep growth in markets that really matter. For example, India and Latin America comprise more than two thirds of our international advertising revenue and we have a significant opportunity to continue to grow as a leader in these markets. Maintaining and enhancing our leadership positions over the next years will be a dramatic contributor to our overall growth of the company.","Our ability to execute on these strategic priorities will be critical to consistently delivering top-line revenue and earnings growth, and creating long-term value for our shareholders, and our plan achieves that. While we have neither the absolute visibility into the success of our shows and films, nor the precise date of the advertising and foreign exchange markets, our fiscal 2016 plan is based on very realistic assumptions within the various markets in which we're active.","As John outlined, next year's financial growth is entirely driven by our cable networks business, led by strong revenue increases coupled with moderating cost growth. Approximately two thirds of this segment's expected 2016 revenues are generated by affiliate fees, with more than 80% of those revenues already locked in from existing affiliate agreements. We also have very good visibility on the anticipated reduction of year-over-year cost growth, which is a direct result of our moving past the peek investment phase at our developing cable channels.","Now there's been much attention paid, and rightly so, to the overall trends in the paid subscriber universe. Our operational focus on our channel distribution is balanced between our traditional markets and the emerging over-the-top services, as they are introduced in the market. We've been very successful so far generating industry-leading affiliate fee growth for years, and with the realignment and strengthening of our key cable network brands, we expect this to continue.","Specifically, even in the context of an expected 1% annual industry decline in the number of base domestic subscribers, we fully expect our total paid subscribers in the U.S. market and globally to grow. While our most distributed networks, FX and Fox News, will likely see reductions in billable subscribers in line with the trends of the U.S. cable and satellite universe, the balance of our networks, including Fox Sports 1 and 2, FXX, National Geographic and National Geographic Wild, will experience good growth in domestic distribution. It's also important to focus on the opportunity with existing and emerging over-the-top platforms. And given the strength of our channels and programming, we expect to be meaningfully participating in these platforms, creating new customer headroom and enhancing competition and innovation downstream.","Moving to our television segment, the network continues to be an area of intense focus. But returning series, such as Empire, Gotham and Last Man on Earth, provide momentum that we'll build upon in the upcoming season. We're very focused on fortifying the Fox brand through adventurous, distinctive programming, and we're very excited to have 10 new series scheduled to premiere next season. Our creative efforts will be supported by retransmission consent fee growth, and we're looking forward to progress in monetizing non-linear impressions as the linear non-live business will continue to face ratings pressure as consumers continue to customize their viewing habits.","At our film segment, while we expect a drop in year-over-year profits due to the timing of our releases, as John outlined, we have high expectations for what is set up to be a very strong slate, with more releases in this past year supported by significant franchise films, including Fantastic Four, Maze Runner, Alvin and the Chipmunks, X-Men and Independence Day, and new franchises led by The Peanuts Movie, Deadpool, and Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiars. And at our television production business, we're very excited about opportunities to build on our returning shows as well as ramping up the creative focus to develop new hits.","So overall, barring unforeseen events outside of our control, we have a high degree of confidence in achieving our earnings guidance for fiscal 2016. Looking forward over those next 12 months, our main focus will be on execution, particularly in the areas of creative excellence, digital, video and advertising capabilities, and channel distribution. Looking further out, while it goes without saying that we're not going to provide specific guidance for 2017 and beyond, I would like to say that we feel very good about the trajectory of our business over the next few years. Our cable networks are expected to maintain the momentum we're forecasting for 2016. Our television segment is stabilizing with new management at the network and some key building blocks that will enable it to reap the benefits of ongoing, strong retransmission increases and materially enhanced advertising capabilities to turn this segment into a source of growth after a number of disappointing years.","We'll reap the benefits of the investments at STAR, as India becomes a real growth engine for our company in 2017 and beyond. We'll also benefit in 2017 in the film segment as the timing issues of 2016 reverse, and a slate of exciting films come to market over the next two years to drive significant profit growth in the film segment from the lows of 2016. Our 2017 results will be further strengthened by the broadcast of Super Bowl 51 and the impact of the next presidential election. We recognize there'll be challenges to navigate the shifting digital landscape; however, we believe the unique strength and scale of these franchises make the next few years a period of great opportunity.","Now as I mentioned earlier, we're a creative business at heart and it's what we put on the screen for customers that drives the whole business. Many of you have heard me use the expression investing upstream, and that's exactly our focus. In the film business, we'll be releasing 23 features over the next year. And in our television production business, we plan on producing a total of approximately 40 series across domestic broadcasting cable networks. By owning the vast majority of content that we program on our networks, we're able to better monetize our IP across multiple revenue streams.","But it's not just quantity, of course, we need to produce hits. And as a result, we need to continually ensure that we have the right environment and culture that attracts great creators to our company. We're very proud of our creative partnerships with some of the greatest writers, directors and producers in the world, including James Cameron, Ridley Scott, Brian Singer, Ryan Murphy, Seth MacFarlane, Howard Gordon, Brian Grazer, Lee Daniels and Danny Strong, Chris Carter, Steve Levitan and so many more. The talent across our entertainment, news and sports operations is the cornerstone of our business and it enables us to continue to take creative risks and seek new opportunities and formats in which to deliver our stories.","Secondly, we're focused on enhancing our capabilities to capitalize on new opportunity to more directly reach and serve our customers and provide solutions for advertisers. On the advertising side, these capabilities are centered on obtaining better measurement of non-linear impressions, improving the monetization of linear and non-linear impressions, enabling programmatic sales and better leveraging true[X] throughout our portfolio. We're encouraged by the early progress we're seeing and in fact we expect and plan to be able to offset the decline we are seeing in domestic network entertainment advertising by better monetization of our digital and non-linear audience over the next 12 months.","On the consumer side, we're thinking a lot about our presence in the direct-to-consumer digital video space. Throughout our global portfolio, particularly at Sky and in India at Tata Sky and with hotSTAR, we've had a great experience in direct-to-consumer businesses. Customer focused and product focused, Sky today operates the biggest streaming business in Europe. Hulu operates the second largest streaming platform in the U.S. and one of the largest digital long-form ad supported platforms in the world and we're also operating the largest over-the-top platform in India.","We've announced recently that Brian Sullivan and many of you know from his recent time leading the growth of Sky Deutschland, or previously heading up Sky's customer group, is now heading up our direct-to-consumer product efforts here. We're very focused on applying all of our enterprise to creating with our partners a great experience where our programming is available, discoverable and accessible in the way that today's and tomorrow's customer expect and deserves.","So as you can see, there's much happening and much to do. Before we go to Q&A, I'd just like to underscore Lachlan's earlier comment regarding our alignment with shareholders' interests. Because as we focus on growth opportunities and long-term value creation, we view this direct alignment to be a very positive feature of the company for all the shareholders of 21st Century Fox.","Now I'd like to turn it back over to Reed.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, James. And now, Ryan, we'd like to turn it over and take questions from the investment community.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Our first question will come from the line of Ben Swinburne with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you. Two questions. First, James, on the cable network outlook, you mentioned domestic affiliate revenue growth and visibility. How long can you guys sustain double-digit growth when you look out, particularly when you factor in how much the landscape is changing? And are the deals that you're signing, do they allow you to go direct-to-consumer? Are there any restrictions? How do you think about balancing that and price when you go through these renewals?","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Ben. Look, I think the \u2013 look, first of all, I think domestic affiliate growth has been pretty strong. And as I said in my comments, I think we will continue a lot of that momentum. We've got really good visibility on the portfolio and as I said about 80% of next year's numbers. And as from time-to-time you get the opportunity to reset that. We think there's still gains to be made both in volume with respect to distributing, getting two-fold distribution, a number of our networks as well as in price, as we continue to invest on screen and really concentrate around these core brands that we've talked about.","So we're pretty optimistic about it actually from our portfolio's perspective, which has some unique kind of elements to it, so we feel good about that. It's also a really exciting time in terms of these affiliate relationships because fundamentally with the vast majority of customers consuming multi-channel television through what are the traditional MVPDs, there's a huge amount of opportunities to innovate on those platforms and both from a standpoint of ad innovation, from the standpoint of new pricing models, et cetera, we think that actually it's a pretty exciting environment to actually be \u2013 to be operating in.","In addition to that, we see new entrants and I think the opportunities for growth with new over-the-top kind of full or medium service MVPDs emerging, we think is a real positive as you see downstream competition increasing that drives a lot of innovation, it drives innovation across the whole kind of subscriber universe and creates new headroom for growth into what we previously called the kind of broadband-only households, which really become part of the pay TV universe through these services, which we think is a positive.","With respect to our flexibility to produce, to go direct-to-consumer and things like that, without getting into the specifics of individual deals, we do \u2013 we have quite a lot of flexibility in terms of how we license the programming, how we license our channels and how we price them both on a wholesale and retail basis. But we haven't made any big decisions on that point at this point and there are no current plans for an independently-priced direct-to-consumer offering right now.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Got it. And then, John, just on the guidance \u2013 at the risk of being greedy, you gave a lot of details, but when I add up the numbers, I use 15% for cable, I'm getting EBITDA pretty close to $7 billion, maybe a little bit less, and growth in the kind of 6% to 7% range. The only missing piece would be other, so I don't know if you had any comment on how we should think about the other, the overhead line in 2016?","John P. Nallen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","No. I think that'll be a touch above where we are from a others and expense category, so that'll be a touch above driven by a number of factors. But you should look at that as a touch above where it is right now.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","A touch above 2014?","John P. Nallen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Yeah, a touch above where 2015's expense came in.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Yes. Got it.","John P. Nallen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","If you think about 2016, it should \u2013 the expense level should be a touch more than where it is.","Benjamin Swinburne - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC","Thank you.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Ben. Ryan, could we have next question, please?","Operator","Comes from the line of David Bank with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","David?","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Sorry about that. I want to follow up on the \u2013 first on one of the comments Lachlan made in his introductory comments about opportunities to potentially bolster the portfolio with companies, like true[X] on the AdTech side. And I guess I wanted to know what is it that you think you might need on the AdTech side now that you have true[X] kind of as the core DMP? What is it you envision as being the kind of perfect opportunistic-type asset to ad?","And then second kind of as a follow-up to the prior question, I think historically you've actually been pretty specific about the duration of the average RSN deal, something like 75% to 80% of the footprint locked up over the next four to five years. Can you remind us of what the distribution visibility looks like going out a little further than the next year or two? Thanks very much.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","I'll take \u2013 David, thanks. It's James. I'll take the second question, and then Lachlan can answer the...","David Bank - RBC Capital Markets LLC","Great.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","...acquisition and the AdTech piece. Just on the RSNs, I mean it's a variety of different timeframes at this point, both in terms of the affiliate agreements and obviously the contractual agreements. But most of them are in that range, even four to five years at this point on average, some longer, some shorter, depending on the marketplace. And so \u2013 and, Lachlan do you want to do the...","Lachlan Keith Murdoch - Executive Co-Chairman","Yeah, sure. Look, on the AdTech \u2013 and I think it's important to recognize that we are at the very beginning of some of the programmatic advertising technologies (39:33), and so we don't see \u2013 while we're not looking at any specific bolt-on acquisitions today, we do expect to do them. And they will be, I said, opportunistic and disciplined as we go. But certainly it's a fast-moving space and we want to be leaders in it.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, David. Operator, could we have next question, please?","Operator","Comes from the line of Vasily Karasyov with CLSA. Please go ahead.","Vasily D. Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you. Good afternoon. James, I think my question is for you. You talked about Hulu, so I was wondering where you see the growth in subscribers coming from. Would you need to take them from other SVOD services or do you believe it's complementary to all existing options? And then given clearly your belief on the potential value here, what is your longer-term plan with the ownership there? And ultimately getting credit in the stock price for the value, if it succeeds?","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Vasily. Look, Hulu is growing really well right now. We're very encouraged by it. We're soon to \u2013 the company is soon to surpass 10 million paid customers with Hulu Plus, and really has the velocity that it hasn't had for years, so we're very excited about that. I think growth is coming from a variety of places. I don't think it's sort of a zero-sum game between Netflix or an Amazon Prime and Hulu. Seems like most customers or many, many customers will have both. And many customers are MVPD customers as well, so it's \u2013 it comes from a variety of places that have very attractive price points, and I think, importantly, with a distinctive offering.","So when you look at the offering of currents, when you look at some of the new output agreements that are coming through Hulu and the breadth of programming there that the team puts together, and the partners contribute, it's very much a unique offering, so people want it in addition to other things. And that's driving really good growth right now.","I think the standpoint of \u2013 the plans for Hulu \u2013 right now Disney and us who are partners in Hulu, obviously Comcast is a partner, but is operating under the consent decree for a while, we are very committed to growing this business, we think it's a very exciting business. We think we can grow it substantially more than it's gotten to to-date. And it can be a very, very valuable asset for us.","I would say when you talk about getting credit for the value, it's a little frustrating, we do think it's a great asset inside our portfolio, but similar to many of the non-consolidated assets in our portfolio, from our stake in Endemol Shine to the big one at Sky, it is a little frustrating, and we don't believe we get the value for those assets. Stake in \u2013 our value in the Sky business this year has gone from $9 billion to well over $12 million in the space of 12 months, not including the substantial and very tax efficient distribution of capital in the transaction that we executed to merge the three Skys that Lachlan mentioned in his remarks.","So, I guess I would \u2013 I'm not going to start asking you the questions, but I think it's probably (42:50) on the call why we might not get that credit, but we're big believers in those businesses and we think they can continue to grow.","Vasily D. Karasyov - CLSA Americas LLC","Thank you.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Vasily. Can we have our next question, please, Ryan?","Operator","That comes from Michael Nathanson with MoffettNathanson. Please go ahead.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Thanks. I have one for James and one for John. James, there's a feeling in the marketplace that as we all gravitate to smaller bundles or the new entrance you talk about like Apple TV, that your RSNs will be dropped. So I wonderer do you think that's a legitimate worry, why or why not?","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Look, there's obviously been a lot of attention on the RSNs \u2013 thanks, Michael, by the way, for your question. Look, I think we take the view that we sort of operate in the domestic marketplace, and we have five core brands that Lachlan outlined. Sports is a broad brand that includes our RSNs, and as we approach these agreements with distributors and with our partners, either over-the-top or otherwise, it's really a complete offering. And I think you have to remember that in the markets where these RSNs are, they are often the most popular channel in the marketplace, we are very, very pleased to just renew for example the St. Louis Cardinals for 15 years, and in St. Louis in baseball season, RSN there is often the number one TV channel in the market.","So, on a market-by- market basis, these channels are hugely compelling, the content is genuinely differentiated and has a passionate following. And I think it's a real benefit to all of our \u2013 to our partners and distributors to carry these things, and we continue to seek to distribute them. I think the question around small bundles and as things emerge, I think we are seeing, and I've spoken about this in the past sort of a \u2013 there is a bit of a re-bundling going on, and I think we're well positioned in that marketplace because of the work that we've done to really invest on screen around these big brands, and to invest in the content that really matters to our customers, and I think local sports is very much a part of that mix, and is a very strong offering.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks. Let me ask one to John. John, I think overall the data points you gave us in guidance, and I appreciate that, is you gave a guidance that you think broadcasting will be flat this year in advertising, and I wonder why do you think that is given the current rate of declines you're seeing now, and also the current rate of network ratings for Fox. Why are you so optimistic that you'll get a flattening of ad revenues the coming year?","John P. Nallen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","I think, realize that in the television segment we have two big classes of programming, right? We got both entertainment and sports. The vibrancy and deepness of the sports marketplace continues. So while we do have linear declines we are projecting internally and hopefully we'll do far better than this, declines on the linear side. Our sports ratings and revenue coming from sports should cover that. In addition, I would say we are also anticipating that declines in the linear side on entertainment will be captured really for the first time by increases in non-linear advertising. So it's that degree of confidence and that plan we have that leads us to flat on advertising overall.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","And if I can just add to that, Michael, as I said in my comments earlier, we really are encouraged by what we're seeing in the non-linear monetization, that's doubtful to say, but we've started \u2013 we've been talking to you and all of our shareholders about this for a little while. We've started to make real investments. We've made an acquisition but we've been investing across the board in our capability there, and it's early days, but we really are encouraged by it. So we see that as a very positive factor and one that \u2013 it's really I think, in success will be create a totally new dynamic in this business where we think about investing on screen, creating multiplatform access and the screening environment in particular being potentially a more attractive advertising environment than the linear environment.","And that's why we think that streaming is so important and really taking a very proactive stance in terms of how our streaming products are presented to customers, how the on-demand universe works around our content and how we're monetizing that. It's something that we're seeing early traction on.","Michael B. Nathanson - MoffettNathanson LLC","Okay. Thanks, James.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Michael. Ryan, next question please.","Operator","Comes from the line of Jessica Reif Cohen with Bank of America. Please go ahead.","Jessica J. Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Thanks. I have two questions. One is a follow-up to James and what you were just talking about. Trying to maybe go through some of the color on some of these investments in advertising that will drive growth, how are you guys thinking about advertising and streaming versus addressability? If you can give color on like the timing, it sounds like you're starting to see some of the benefits and I guess as part of that, you mentioned that India and LatAm are big areas of growth for advertising. Could some of these investments you're making here be applied in some of the areas of the world?","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks, Jessica. The \u2013 look, I think as Lachlan mentioned, this is an area sort of advertising technology that we want to be proactive in and we want to be \u2013 from a standpoint of monetizing our product and making this a place such a great place for creators to come and make things and do well with them. We think advertising technology is an important part of that. The true[X] acquisition was an important acquisition for us because we really embedded in the operations of the business and that's leading to new opportunities.","I think from the standpoint of analytics that we've been doing already and really gearing up outside of that, it fits in very well from the standpoint of looking at new things that we can do in terms of product innovation from engagement units to time-shifted advertising and other things, we think that that's pretty exciting. And in the streaming environment, something that you can do in a much more targeted and addressable basis, so you can be more efficient with lighter loads and create a better customer experience in the on-demand marketplace as well as the linear marketplace as well.","So, those are the sorts of things that we're very focused on and looking at, as well as really just getting, putting more weight into the digital sales effort itself, working with clients and agencies around creating the currencies that really can generate demand. On the international markets or ex-U.S. markets, already to give you an example, the hotSTAR platform in India, which was a very, very rapidly \u2013 is a rapidly growing mobile Internet platform around all of our programming that we create known in India which is a lot.","We are working very closely between the STAR teams and the Fox Networks and particularly the true[X] team to build the ad platform underneath that, we've sort of taken a view that we really wanted to build audience first and the ad platform is being kind of done in parallel, but this capability directly applies and is being applied to creating some of those new opportunities.","I think the other piece here on Latin America and India, and particular India, don't forget how strong the linear advertising market is, when you have a real position of ratings leadership that we have and we can sustain that, we're able to really grow our linear advertising very, very attractively and still the majority of that marketplace for a while yet is that way and there's a huge amount of growth to come. I mean you don't see it really in the numbers consolidated because of the sports investment we've been making, but the entertainment business alone in India in fiscal 2015 is over $300 million EBITDA business and that's something that is growing at a very rapid pace. So it's a real \u2013 there's a real advertising marketplace there that is growing organically and we're able to grow our share in it as we go forward.","Jessica J. Reif Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Okay, great. And then the second question is when you have a hit like Empire, how are you thinking about monetizing it differently? Can you just talk about how you would monetize it over the next one, two, three years versus what you would've done in the past year or so?","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Well, I think the most important thing about Empire is as we go into the second season, which is coming up right away, is that we get it creatively right, and we're very confident in our partners and the writers and producers and the cast there who have really proven themselves to be just tremendous, but our real focus is on launching the show giving it the appropriate marketing support and getting out there properly.","The non-linear monetization on that is an addition is a new feature here and what we're seeing going forward is the ability to monetize a much more spread out view. And we talked a lot as an industry around three days versus seven days. I think we're probably more focused on 30 days and six months. We're still seeing customers come to the pilot episode of Empire on some platforms. And in the coming years, being able to monetize that audience, which is a quality-live, engaged audience, is going to be just as important as audiences in other windows. So it's more about the total breadth of audience across programming that's made over a longer period of time that you can do well with, not to mention other windows, SVOD, box sets, series stacking and things like that.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Jessica. Ryan, can we have next question, please.","Operator","Comes from the line of Rich Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I have a couple. One just kind of on the management side. I guess it'd be great to hear from Lachlan and James, could you kind of explain exactly how the management structure will work? Does one of you have final say, meaning does James report to Lachlan or vice versa? Or do you split up the company's divisions or you look at everything jointly? And then I have a business question.","Lachlan Keith Murdoch - Executive Co-Chairman","Sure. Rich, can you hear me? Let me start with that. So with the management structure, it is a true fifty-fifty partnership. James and I have been working together for many years. I think we know each other better than anyone knows us. And so as we work towards this transition, which has also becoming a \u2013 has been a focus of ours over some time, we've gone into this carefully thinking it out and with our eyes very open. And I've got to say, it's working extraordinarily well. We are either together or we talk together on a daily basis. And I think that what's really important to understand here is that we are both sort of uniquely invested in the success of the company. And we're also both uniquely invested in each other's success. And that's really the key to this relationship. And so we're very pleased with how it's working out.","Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC","And then just in terms of thinking about James' comments and your comments about the challenging structural changes that are going on, we're seeing obviously a TV ad market that feels increasingly like it's in secular decline. And we're seeing comments from Disney and others about the bundle really starting to fray and more consumers either shaving or giving up entirely. Just wondering now that we've had the management change at Fox, how do you think about a merger of equals with Time Warner? Why isn't gaining greater scale in IP a priority as you look out into 2016 and beyond?","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Hi, Rich. It's James. Look, I think first of all, it's not a new \u2013 it was a year ago today when we finished speculating on hypothetical M&A activity. Listen, we're big believers in the content business. We are big believers in IP, and we think scale is important. But our focus as we've been saying for a while, our focus is very much on execution. We really like the product mix that we have and the asset mix that we have, and we are able to dial up that scale as you've seen both in terms of investing in markets where we have really a deep presence like in parts of Latin America or India, and in the U.S., where we're increasing the volume of our production pretty dramatically. And we feel like we have the capability to do that.","Without commenting on any hypothetical future activity, we like the asset mix. We think we're in a good position. And I think to your point about the sort of changing landscape, as I mentioned earlier in my remarks, I think we have sort of a unique set of assets here where even though we can talk about the whole MVPD universe and as you mentioned the kind of total subscriber trends there, but our channels and brands still have headroom for growth, many of them, most of them actually, because they're at a different life stage, if you will.","And also we're really going in and challenging in markets where we're bringing new competition in the national sports network market, in the business news market, in places like that that had dominant players. And we're really coming from a different base, really going and taking share. In June, we out-rated ESPN on Fox Sports 1, for the first time, kind of a milestone. And we're very excited about the opportunities for those things to grow. But that doesn't mean that we're complacent.","The fundamental point that I think we're trying to make here is that we are more proactive than ever and will be with our partners in the MVPD universe and new over-the-top players coming in to really make sure that from a customer experience point-of-view, the on-demand kind of universe for them and the product offering of our set of content is something that is really special and works for them and meets and exceeds their expectations and that's something that I think from the standpoint of, I think, the last 20 years maybe in the cable industry, our channels business, et cetera, we haven't really as an industry in the U.S. been that focused on. As a large part of our business is direct-to-consumer around the world, we're really applying a lot of that and thinking about how we partner with all of these players as well as increase the capability ourselves to go out and do a better job there and grow the business.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Rich. Ryan, can we have next question, please.","Operator","That comes from the line of Todd Juenger with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","Hi. Thank you very much. Probably not a big shocker here. I would love to ask just for some more thoughts probably James on the trade-off you think of when you think about the various platforms, especially those that exist outside of the bundle where people are consuming more and more of content like yours. And do you agree or disagree that as consumers have the chance to watch your content in environments that are outside of the bundle often that don't contain advertising or even if they do, like the asset you partly own which is Hulu, do you not agree that that creates further risk for core elements of your business like affiliate fees and you \u2013 they expressed excitement about digital, we delivered advertising that are clearly the core growth drivers in the plan to lay forward? Would love to hear how you think about those trade-offs. Thank you.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thank you. Thanks, Todd, for your questions. Thank you for your letter.","Todd Juenger - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC","I'm glad you read it.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","I gave it to Lachlan, he said so okay. Listen, I think it's a good question. I think what we have to think about and what we do as a team here, this is something that occupies a huge amount of our time thinking about how do we \u2013 as the platform choices the customers are making really evolve when you see a lot more competition downstream in terms of the retailing of video programming, either on ad supported or not ad supported. Internet networks like Netflix versus kind of smaller bundles like Hulu Plus. There's \u2013 we need to get a better understanding and we've developed this now about where our best business is and then what we need to do within those businesses to do \u2013 to make it better.","So for example, when we talk about our digital non-linear advertising business starting to really get a little bit of traction and thinking about offsetting some of the linear declines, a lot of that comes both from our own sort of either authenticated apps and online distribution of our product, but really a lot of it comes from Hulu inventory that we're able to monetize better and better as we go along. So it's really about working in this developing system to be able to create new opportunities to do better than we're doing in the linear kind of scheduled multi-channel environment.","And I think it's really important to note that even though we might be going through 10 million Hulu customers and there's 10 growing to 10 plus X million broadband-only households, so to speak, really this 85 million, 90 million MVPD household marketplace, all digital with new services being rolled out through that universe is a huge opportunity in terms of ad innovation, in terms of bundling and pricing, in terms of on-demand capability and we're very committed to making that the best experience it can in partnership with some of our biggest wholesale customers be it DIRECTV or Comcast or whomever.","So I think our goal here is to be a really flexible licensor to make our distributors successful, but also to make the economics of distribution on these platforms enhance from where they are today, and that's really coming from, as I said in my comments, discoverability of our content, accessibility across multiple platforms and multiple devices and ad innovation that is candidly less interruptive, more targeted, lower load and higher priced.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Todd. Ryan, could we have next question, please?","Operator","That comes from the line of Doug Mitchelson with UBS. Please go ahead.","Doug Mitchelson - UBS Securities LLC","Thanks so much. Two questions. One for James; I think investors want to give you more credit for STAR in India, but every time it looks like profit growth is going to take off, there's something new to invest in and it's all worked out but sports or regional networks or building out more channels, I think that's been the story of a better part of 20 years. So just I think, James, as you look at over the next few years is essentially the build-out of the platform in India done and margin starts to grow along with revenues or is there potentially more to invest in India that we should make sure we think about in our models.","And I'll just have the second one for John. I know I hate to rehash Ben's question, but I'm math challenged, so when I take cable networks at mid-teens and minus $200 million on film and flat on TV, other up a little bit. I get 7% growth $6.95 billion. Is that mid-single digits in your mind? Or am I just math challenged?","John P. Nallen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Let me jump on that one. I'm not about to fill in Excel spreadsheets for a lot of people, but there's a range that mid-single digits is in. And I think given the number of data points that we've given, which is I mean pretty significant, when we reflect on it, I think you can get to a range in mid-single that we're running the business toward.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Doug, thanks for your question about India. I think \u2013 look, I'd say it's a fair \u2013 it's a good question. We are enthusiasts about the business there. I think I would say it's probably been \u2013 I don't know if it's in 20 years. I'd say 15 years ago, we started broadcasting in Hindi and created STAR Plus and that really put us on the pathway to turning around STAR TV overall and particularly creating something in India that could be profitable and really lift our Asian business. Remember before that it was a big \u2013 a heavy loss maker. So I think over the last 15 years, we were able to kind of organically invest in programming, organically invest in some new channels in certain areas and got to a pretty good place.","Certainly over the last six or seven years, we've really dialed it up in terms of how we invest there and what we want to do. And you're right. Listen, I mean the regional language business is something that we thought was important for us. We did that in a combination of acquisitions with Asianet and more recently MAA TV, but also organically creating STAR Pravah, STAR Jalsha, and so forth, some organic offshoots in regional languages.","I think at this point, we're really seeing the scale of the sports investment, which is really a bigger organic investment than anything we've done there in the past peak, and we have good visibility around the revenue growth around the business and the amelioration of the rate of growth in the sports investment going forward. So I do think that when we look out in 2017, 2018 and beyond, you can see real operating leverage in terms of profits in the India business come through.","Now that said, we're big believers in the marketplace and if we saw opportunities there that could materially enhance the value of the business, we would have to be very thoughtful about them. But I think from an organic investment point-of-view outside of the digital investment in hotSTAR and really growing that, you're seeing a peak in the television business given the scale of the sports investment we've made. And we don't see any new major sports rights in the very near-term horizon that would materially change that. We've successfully exited the CLT20 competition this year and launched the second season of Kabaddi actually at a very cost-effective rate, which is year-on-year up 45% in its early matches, so we think that's pretty good. So I think we're still very much on track to see $0.5 billion or so of EBITDA in India within the next sort of three years or so, and a real velocity towards $1 billion of EBITDA shortly thereafter around the end of the decade or the beginning of the next one.","Lachlan Keith Murdoch - Executive Co-Chairman","Yeah, and I'd add, Doug, that there are \u2013 just as we've gone through cycles, even in the U.S., there are years where we're heavy on sports, when a World Cup occurs, much like when a Super Bowl occurs in the U.S. So there's \u2013 I wouldn't call it as lumpy anymore, but there are years where there will be particularly big events that'll occur.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, but that's right, not quite as lumpy as it has been.","Lachlan Keith Murdoch - Executive Co-Chairman","Exactly.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Doug. Ryan, could we have next question, please?","Operator","That comes from the line of Anthony DiClemente with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thanks for taking my questions. James, you mentioned June being a big month for FS1. As you guys continue to build out FS1, do you think you want more sports rights? I mean some investors wonder if you'd consider bidding on Thursday Night Football if and when it comes up?","And then, John, if you'd just indulge one more question about the guidance, can you talk about what's in the budget for cable advertising? I know you talked about television. What's embedded in cable advertising that's in your fiscal 2016 outlook? Thanks a lot.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, okay. The \u2013 thanks very much. The thing on the sports rights, look, I think we're pretty \u2013 as we've said before about Fox Sports 1, we were very clear and transparent about what we were investing in and the rights packages that we had acquired and that we're pretty happy with them. So on Fox Sports 1, we don't see anything in the near-term that is terribly material that we need to go and do to achieve our plans. The portfolio is really coming through now and we're starting to see the impact of the investments and deals that we've made over the last 18 months to two years, as those things kind of roll through in Fox Sports 1.","With respect to Thursday Night Football, first of all, without getting into idle speculation about it, I would imagine that a lot of that would end up being in broadcast and not on Fox Sports 1, so it's slightly different question, but it's very \u2013 we've been a partner of the NFL for many, many years. We love the NFL product. We think our customers love football. We know they do and it remains and continues to be a really unique offering for customers and we're always interested in finding ways that make sense to enhance what we can do and to try to do more with really unique events like the NFL, and I think we're seeing encouraging signs now in the summertime around the new NFL season in terms of pricing and advertising and we remain very, very committed to the sport. So if there were opportunities that made sense, we would of course consider them.","John P. Nallen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","Anthony, on the \u2013 you pick the one metric of course that I didn't offer but I will give it to you. On advertising, we're expecting mid to high single-digits coming out of the domestic portfolio at this point in FS 2, important there as is Fox News given what is turning into be a big political year and probably a massive viewership coming in the next day to that network. Those will be drivers of our advertising gains. Internationally, we're probably in the mid-teens range and STAR particularly will continue to be the growth driver behind that.","Anthony DiClemente - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Awesome. Thanks a lot.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Anthony. Operator, I think we have time for one last question, please.","Operator","Okay. And that will come from the line of Bryan Kraft with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi. Thanks for taking the question. I had one for James and Lachlan and another for John. James or Lachlan, Sky, how do you see it fitting in with the strategic portfolio at this point? How do you think about the potential to spin it off at some point or would it make more sense to own more? You talked about not getting credit for it in your evaluation. And then, John, I just wanted to ask you what's reflected in the guidance as far as currency exchange rates and hedges? In other words, is the guidance reflective of some combination of current spot rates and hedges that you've put in place or is it based on current spot rates at this point with some cushion maybe from the hedges? Just wanted to get a little more color on that. Thank you.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Thanks very much, Bryan. It's James. On Sky, look, I think we've been pretty clear about this in the past and I think I'll be consistent today. Obviously, we do get a little frustrated that the credit and the value doesn't necessarily flow through, but at the same time, we believe the business is dynamic and growing business and an exciting one. We've been very focused on completing the transaction at last year taking our consolidated assets at Sky Deutschland and Sky Italia and combining those with what was BSkyB and is now Sky Plc and we think that's been very, very attractive for Sky and Sky shareholders and very, very attractive for us and our shareholders.","And we're very focused on supporting the company in terms of completing that integration and really dialing up the velocity which that business can operate and perform, and I think you saw their results last week and that is all going reasonably well. So we like the business. We think it's a very strong business and one that has a huge amount of headroom for growth. That said, these unconsolidated assets are something that a number of years ago we said about to simplify and we've done that in a variety of places around the world with a number of assets that we've either divested of or acquired the balance of. But today we have no immediate plans around that and we're focused very much on supporting Sky in its growth and we think that's creating a lot of value over the long-term for us, although to your point, not necessarily realized in our stock price today.","John P. Nallen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Executive VP","And, Bryan, as you think about foreign exchange for us, your focus should be more on current spot rates. That's the way we generally price this. We do have a moderate, I describe it as, hedging program focused on four particular currencies, sterling, euro, reais and peso. But to be honest, we'd like to if foreign exchange rates change, we've left enough room to capture the upside, but current rates is really the place that you should focus as far as analyzing where we'd be on foreign exchange.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Thank you, Bryan.","Bryan Kraft - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thank you.","Reed Nolte - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations","Now I'd like to turn it over to James for a few closing comments.","James Rupert Murdoch - Co-Chief Operating Officer & Director","Yeah, thanks, Reed, and thank you, everyone for being on the call today and taking the time. Lachlan and John and I just thought we'd like to leave you with a few quick points of \u2013 a few comments of really reinforcement. First of all, we finished 2015 having achieved many of our goals. And we think with a really good position for the future and hopefully we've been able to flush a little bit of that out for you today.","Secondly, the financial profile of the business is strong and our approach to capital allocation has been and it will be consistent. And thirdly, our focus is very much on execution. And our energy and our enterprise are being applied to this strategy of creative excellence, customer focus and also global scale. So all of us here are very allied to the opportunities, and we're super aligned and energized about what's before us.","So I look forward to speaking to you all in the future, as we all do.
