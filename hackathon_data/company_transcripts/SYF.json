After we complete the presentation, we will open up the call for questions.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Greg. Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results.","I'll begin on slide three. Second quarter net earnings totaled $489 million or $0.58 per diluted share. Solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms, driving strong growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and net interest income this quarter. Purchase volume grew 9%, loan receivables grew 11%, and net interest income grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. Our online and mobile purchase volume also continued its strong growth trajectory. Second quarter sales grew 27% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range.","As per asset quality metrics, 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year. And our net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% in the second quarter of last year. Expenses were in line with our expectations, increasing 4% over last year and were largely driven by the growth we are producing. We generated positive operating leverage and our overall efficiency ratio improved 157 basis points to 31.9%. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which increased $9 billion or 23% to $46 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources, and know this is slightly above our original target range of 60% to 70%. We plan to continue to drive deposit growth by offering competitive rates, outstanding customer service, and a continued enhancement of our product suite. One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full scale online bank.","Given our significant deposit growth, we were able to fully pay-off our bank term loan on April 5, well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Our balance sheet remains strong with Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.5%, and liquid assets totaling $14 billion or 70% of total assets at quarter end. The strength of our balance sheet and financial performance has enabled us to start returning capital to shareholders. As we announced earlier this month, our board approved the $0.13 quarterly dividend and has $952 million annual share repurchase program. We will now begin to opportunistically repurchase our stock and look forward to building on these actions, as we look to deploy capital through both growth of the business and return to shareholders.","Moving to business highlights, we recently renewed several key relationships, including Ashley HomeStores, Suzuki, VCA Animal Hospitals, and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. We also continued to sign partnerships in the travel and entertainment space. We won a new U.S. based program with Cathay Pacific Airways. We also signed a new program with Fareportal, one of the largest and fastest growing online travel companies. These programs add to our growing T&E portfolio, that already includes recently launched programs with (05:44) and Marvel Entertainment. The launch of our new program with Marvel this quarter includes an attractive cash back value proposition, where the greatest benefits are accrued on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks.","We are excited about these new partnerships as we believe this is a segment that provides attractive opportunities and we are pleased to extend our presence in it. We also launched a new program with Mattress Firm, one of the nation's premier specialty bedding retailers. We continue to be highly focused on driving organic growth and pursuing new opportunities to grow our business. We are working closely with our current partners to deliver incremental value and drive program growth and provide value to our cardholders.","Moving to slide four, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans grew 10% over the second quarter of last year. Previously, we had reported platform revenue, but starting with this quarter we will utilize interest and fees on loans as a means of discussing our business performance favoring this GAAP measure that more closely aligns with the growth metrics of our business. During the quarter, we continued to drive growth by delivering value to our partners and cardholders via attractive value proposition, promotional financing and marketing office.","On the next slide, I'll discuss this quarter's performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the second quarter, as shown on slide five. Retail Card generated another strong quarter of results, receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8%, and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The strong growth in Retail Card continued to be broad-based as we serve growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnerships with Cathay Pacific and Fareportal, and the launch of the new Marvel program.","We have developed strong long-term relationships that solidify our position in the space, and provide the foundation for the addition of new partnerships and the expansion into new sectors, such as travel and entertainment. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 16%, and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The majority of the industries, where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products. We had a very active quarter with the renewal of key relationships with Ashley HomeStores and Suzuki and the launch of the Mattress Firm program. We continue to expand card reuse in Payment Solutions, which represented 26% of purchase volume in the second quarter.","CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 10%, and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees on loans increased 5%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties, and we are pleased to renew an important veterinary partnership with VCA Animal Hospitals, as well as our strategic partnership with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. Expanding the network and utility of our CareCredit card also continues to be an area of focus, and reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop extent and deepen relationships and drive value to card holders.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. In the second quarter, the business earned $489 million of net income, which translates to $0.58 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 9%, receivables up 11%, and interest and fees on loans up 10%. Average active accounts increased 8% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions on our card, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average balances and spend, with growth and average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year, and purchase volume per average active account increasing 2% over last year.","The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $281 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth, which I'll cover in more detail later. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and slightly better than 2Q, 2014 of 3.82%. The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year, and 4.88% in 2Q 2014. Delinquencies were consistent with the range we have seen in the second quarter over the past two years, with net charge-offs staying lower than the range.","Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.70%. As we noted in June, we expected the allowance to increase 20 basis points to 30 basis points in the second quarter, compared to the first quarter level of 5.5%. RSAs were up $43 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter, compared to 4.1% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with the growth in the programs, as well as the incremental reserve build, which more than offset incremental sharing on the year-over-year improvements and net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio.","Given the increase in the reserve level, we expect the RSA percentage on a full-year basis to trend closer to the 4.2% to 4.3% range. Other income decreased $37 million versus last year. In the prior year, there was a $20 million gain on portfolio sales which should not (12:31) repeat. The remainder of the decrease is attributable to higher loyalty and rewards costs that were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. While interchange was up $28 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store (12:45) spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that was up $41 million, primarily driven by new value propositions, including the Walmart 3-2-1 value prop. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.","Other expenses increased $34 million or 4% versus last year. Now, that we are comparing to periods where the infrastructure build is largely in a run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth, as well as strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.9%, which was 157-basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and staying disciplined on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating a ROA of 2.4%.","I'll move to slide seven and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 10% driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.86% for the quarter, up 9 basis points over last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are few dynamics worth highlighting. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. The yield on receivables declined 14 basis points to 21%, reflecting the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth and promotional balances, particularly in Payment Solutions.","The cost of funding was up 7 basis points to 1.9%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased $9 billion or 23% year-over-year. We're pleased with the progress we make growing our direct deposit platform; deposits are now 71% of our funding versus 61% last year. The second quarter margin was 15.86%, which was 9 basis points better than last year, and slightly better than the first quarter of 15.76%. And as we discussed on our first quarter call, we expect it to be fairly stable for the balance of the year. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance.","Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. The backdrop for credit is still favorable. However, our forecast indicates that credit will gradually normalize higher from the recent lows. It's important to note that we are not seeing a step change. Our view takes into consideration factors like portfolio mix, as well as account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. We consider all of these factors in our underwriting today, and we're still seeing very attractive returns across the credit spectrum. In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.79% compared to 3.53% last year, and 90-plus day delinquencies were 1.67% compared to 1.52% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past two years.","The net charge-off rate was 4.49% compared to 4.63% last year, and 4.88% in 2Q 2014. The net charge-offs were somewhat lower than the range we had experienced over the past two years. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.7% in the second quarter, in line with the range we provided in June. This results in the allowance coverage of approximately 13 months to 15 months of expected charge-offs, which should be fairly consistent going forward. So as you think about credit normalization from here, we expect net charge-offs will be around 4.5% in 2016, which is largely in line with our guidance for the year, and we've indicated that we expect net charge-offs to trend 20 basis points to 30 basis points higher over the next four quarters, which should be helpful as you think about 2017.","So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment when it comes to credit, and the risk adjusted yields we're earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive. Moving to slide nine, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continued to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $839 million for the quarter, a 4% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $51 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation, as well as growth of the business.","This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees, as well as the replacement of certain services that were provided to us under the GE TSA. Professional fees were down $2 million, this is primarily driven by growth in the business, which was more than offset by the reduction in third-party services mentioned previously, as well as expenses related to last year's EMV rollout, which did not repeat. Marketing and business development costs were down $1 million, higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive strong growth in purchase volume receivables, were offset by lower marketing costs, related to our deposit platform, as well as redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense.","Information processing was up $7 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expenses down $21 million due to benefits from EMV, as well as a reduction in TSA costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE. The efficiency ratio was 31.9% for the quarter, 157 basis points lower than last year, as the business drove positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume related expenses in the second half of the year, as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, we expected to remain below 34% in line with what we communicated back in January.","Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as recap our capital plan. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This put deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit funding. And while we have now moved slightly over the top end of our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities.","Longer term we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products over the next couple of years, such as check-in (20:16) and online bill pay. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, and is now 18% of our funding. In May, we successfully issued $600 million in five-year fixed rate notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization between 15% to 20% of our total funding.","Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources. This reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April, well ahead of the contractual maturity in 2019. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and in May we did issue $500 million and 18-month floating rate notes. So a fairly active quarter on the issuance front, and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18.5% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules, and 18% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.5% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 150 bps over the past year.","Total liquidity increased to $21 billion, and includes $14 billion in cash and short-term treasuries, and an additional $7 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels. Before I wrap up, I wanted to recap our initial capital plan actions we announced on July 7. Our board approved a $0.13 quarterly common stock dividend, as well as a share repurchase program of up to $952 million for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017.","We expect to make sure repurchase is subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Our board also declared our first quarterly cash dividend of $0.13 per share payable on August 25 to holders of record at the close of business on August 12. Overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we're very pleased to be in a position to begin returning capital to our shareholders.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a summary of the quarter on slide 11, and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter, we again delivered significant growth across key areas of our business. We signed, renewed, and launched a number of important partnerships, and further expanded the breath of business segments we are serving, and our pipeline of additional opportunities remain strong. Our digital channels remain a key component of our overall strategy, and we've delivered strong growth there as well. And to support our growth, we are successfully expanding our deposit base and increasing its importance as a source of our overall funding. Our strong capital position and performance has enabled us to begin to return capital to our shareholders, a goal that we are very pleased to have achieved.","I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call.","Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And our first question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Morning, guys. Thanks very much. First, with respect to credit, obviously, you guys gave us revised guidance a few weeks back, but the quarter reflected fairly strong kind of year-over-year credit trends. Just for, I guess, sort of ratification, when should we see the pace is in sales (24:45) pick up based on what you're seeing in delinquencies and low rate trends at this point?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah John, you cut out in (24:55) room a little bit, but I think your question was around 2Q credit being a little bit better than you expected. Is that right?","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Correct. And then, what pace should we see it start to normalize given the delinquency and low rates?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah, sure. So I would disconnect the guidance a little bit from what happened in the quarter. In the quarter, we had a little bit higher recoveries. If you look over the past two year's recoveries, it'd been running in the 1.1% to 1.2% of receivables kind of range. This quarter, they are right around 1.3%, so that drove a bit of the improvement. Going forward and what was included in our guidance is that recoveries would be pretty similar to where they've been in the last two years, so somewhere in that 1.1% to 1.2% of receivables. So that's really what was contemplated in the forward guidance. So no change to what we said in June, we gave you kind of what we think we're going to close the year at for 2016 at around 4.5%, and then starting kind of incrementally year-over-year 20 basis points to 30 basis points for the first quarter and the second quarter of 2017.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Great. Thanks for the color there. And then just thinking about net interest margin, obviously there was a little bit of benefit this quarter because of the ratio of liquid assets to receivables. Are you able to kind of further optimize that, or how should we think about the movement there, and what that means to margin in the near-term?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. The net interest margin came in pretty similar to where we were in the first quarter. At that point, we had paid down the bank term loan, so we were able to optimize liquidity a bit, and take some of that excess and pay down the bank term loan. We're obviously really pleased with that, and we thought jumping off in the first quarter the margin would be pretty stable for the balance of the year, which was right around, I think 15.75%. We still think that's a pretty good way to think about the back half of the year. If deposit growth continues at this pace, we'll get a small benefit there. We might be able to do a little bit more on liquidity, but probably not much.","If you look at the year-over-year we have been able to improve the yield that we're earning on the cash and the treasuries. But then there is some, what I would call, modest offsets to those two positives. One, we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. As you know, those are our promotional balances, so those come on initially at a lower yield. And then our guidance initially back in January included a small benefit from another 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year, and obviously that looks a little bit less likely. So some few puts and takes, I would say, but the margins should be pretty stable for the back half of the year.","John Hecht - Jefferies LLC","Great. I appreciate the details. Thanks.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Good morning.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Maybe I could start-off with a question on the RSA, Brian. It was down 30 basis points year-over-year, and I think it's around 4% in the first half versus a guide for 4.2% to 4.3%, and that implies the RSA will be roughly in line with the back half of last year, give or take couple of basis points. So I guess, all else equal that would probably \u2013 my math, that implies either provision in the back half of this year that's similar to last year, or we get continued improvement in efficiency. So can you just maybe help us understand, why the RSA would go back up to the second half of last year's level, given how much it's come down in the first half or is it just being conservative on the guidance?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Well, I think, there is a few things. So if we just \u2013 let's just break down the quarter maybe a little bit on the RSA. The RSA obviously included an offset on the reserve build, that's why you saw it down year-over-year, that's why we revised the guidance on RSAs from round 4.5% to 4.2% to 4.3%. You also have to remember that a lot of things in the P&L got better year-over-year. So we had obviously better revenue, margins were little bit better, efficiency ratio was better as you indicated. So all else being equal, that would have resulted in a higher RSA percent compared to last year.","And then those improvements were both more than offset by the higher reserve build and the higher provision. And the one thing, I'm not sure you're taking into account, as you think about the back half of the year, the third quarter is typically the high watermark on the RSA. We've got some seasonality, and if you look back over the past two years you do see the RSA percentage trend up a bit in the third quarter seasonally. So as you think about the back half, you've got to factor that end, but that's all included in the outlook for the 4.2% to 4.3% for the year.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And then, maybe I could ask a follow up on credit. You talked about losses at 4% or 5%, and then up 20% to 30% be for the four quarters after. Can you maybe just give us a sense of how much the upward bias on losses is actually coming from higher growth, so we've all heard about various banks talk about the impact of seasoning on portfolios, how much is actually coming from lower late stage QR rates that you talked about? And just, we're obviously up this year and next year and I know you don't have a crystal ball of three years. But at what level would you actually expect losses to begin to start leveling off assuming growth levels off?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. I mean, there is a lot of factors here and some of these are obviously cause and effect. In June, our comments indicated that we're expecting to see this modest increase in net charge-offs. As part of that, we focus specifically around the payment behaviors that we are driving the reserve build in the quarter. Now, we're giving you some broader context on some of the dynamics that we take into account when we build the forecast. And those are things like portfolio mix, like platform, product, program, channel, as well as account maturation or seasoning of vintages, as well as the overall consumer trends.","Now, I would say, if you look at seasoning of vintages for us, it absolutely plays out similarly in private label as it does for general purpose cards. So we typically see peak losses at around 24 months. I think that's pretty consistent with the rest of the industry. However, our growth rates have been more consistent than I think others. So while it certainly plays a factor in what we're seeing in our expectation, our growth rates haven't been perfectly consistent. So I'd say, it's a factor, but it's a not a significant, I think for us is what you're seeing for others out there.","Ryan M. Nash - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Sure, Ryan.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Yes, Margaret, I was wondering if you can comment on the pipeline of potential portfolio partnership acquisitions. And then can you talk a little bit about on these larger deals, what your competitive advantage is versus your larger peer, and kind of how you approach those types of transactions?","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So I'd say overall our pipeline continues to be robust. I think, I've mentioned in past calls that we have dedicated resources in each of our three platforms, and I think you can tell, by even this quarter we won some nice deals. We feel competitively in the $500 million to $1 billion portfolio size. The competition is pretty reasonable, and we really compete effectively there. When you get to the bigger portfolios, obviously the cost goes, an example of that, it gets much more competitive. I would say, overall on the bigger deals that are out there or people are discussing, I think, we start by competing on our capabilities and the history and the level of experience that we have in the industry, and that's how most of these conversations start. I would say, we generally win on those types of things.","We feel that some of the things we've invested in, in the last couple of years, particularly around online and digital mobile are really playing to our advantage. We feel we're further ahead than the competition there. I think the other area that we're continuing to invest in is really the whole data analytics portion of the business, and really leveraging some new technology there. So on a capability point of view, I think, we have a couple of areas where I think we're a little ahead. We are very partner focused. And I think, the key relationships we have today really help reiterate with potential partners how we worked with our partners, and that I think is another advantage. So I think it's overall capabilities, experience and long-term relationships and partnerships that we have.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. And on program deals like Cathay Pacific, can you talk a little bit? I mean, on one hand it's very good for your loan growth, but I wonder if that's a slightly more competitive segment, and can you talk a little bit about how you won that deal and the returns relative to private label transactions?","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. Co-brand is a little more competitive. But I think we're not \u2013 our strategy is really to look at co-brand and Dual Card opportunities in the business that meet our returns. So Cathay and Fareportal being the other one for this quarter, again, it started out with our capabilities and our partnering experience, and that's really how we won both of those deals. When we look at overall return, every deal that we do, we make sure it's kind of competitive with any overall return for our business, and we look to ensure that we're keeping that return in mind, as we take our new opportunities. I don't know Brian, if you'll add anything on returns.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. The only thing I would say Don is, you're going to see us be pretty selective around co-brand opportunities. We like the space, but we're going to be cautious around it. You're probably not going to see us go after the really big marquee deals, but we're, as Margaret said, we can go in and compete and demonstrate our capabilities and win on that basis, and still earn an attractive return. We're going to go after those deals.","Donald Fandetti - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Thank you.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Hi. In past quarters, Margaret, you've had more commentary on the digital channels. I was wondering if you could share some of the metrics that you've had in the past, or at least qualitatively describe some of the trajectory you're seeing there.","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Sure. So I'll just say that, the digital channels continue to be important, as more and more consumers are active on the digital channel. Our online sales for the quarter were up 27% versus the second quarter last year. Approximately a third of our applications now occur digitally, and if you go back to 2012 to current, we've received over 11 million mobile applications, and that's growing at about 78% year-over-year. So if you compare us to the industry, I think our growth is much stronger. The industry overall is reporting somewhere around 14% to 15%. And I think this is an area where the question earlier of how we compete, I think this is an area where extraordinarily important for us to ensure we're investing. We have a position with GPShopper. We've been able to leverage that partnership and help our partners, actually get out mobile applications sooner where we're fully integrated into the application. So those are the types of things that I think as industries shift from brick-and-mortar to more online, we just have to be the best-in-class on those types of things.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you. And I just want to ask one follow up Greig, about the OpEx seasonality, if you could share some perspective on that.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah, sure. This is Brian. I assume (37:13), but if you want to hear from Greig, I can put him on.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Well, I'm sorry (37:15).","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","I'm happy to put him on the line as well.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","I apologize Brian.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","That's all right. So we obviously delivered, I think a pretty strong efficiency ratio in the first half of the year. What I would tell you this quarter is similar to what I told you last quarter, which is we do expect the efficiency ratio to rise from here in the back half of the year, really for two reasons; we do more marketing and promotions in the second half of the year, particularly around holiday, and so that will drive an increase in the efficiency ratio. And we also have more of our strategic investment spend stacked against the second half of the year as well. So as those investments come in throughout the year, we would expect the ratio to increase, but we'll still be within the annual guidance of below 34% for the year.","James Friedman - Susquehanna Financial Group LLLP","Thank you very much.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Thanks guys for taking my question this morning. I'd love to sort of circle back on the questions related to RSA, and uses as an opportunity, perhaps refine the way we think about this. Brian, I realized you gave guidance and that's really helpful. But I'd love to delve into the mechanics here. When we look at the interest income and fees quarter-over-quarter, those were roughly flat. Provision was up about a $100 million. That would suggest assuming that there is a 50%-50% share on the RSAs that you would expect roughly a $50 million decline in RSA expense. We didn't see that, that wasn't our assumption either. But I'd love to talk through, is it an accrual issue, is it a timing issue, how do we think about this on a dollar basis as opposed to a percentage basis?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. Rick, part of the reason why we did give you some guidance on this is, as we recognized that it's very hard for you to model based on the information you have, and part of the reason for that is that, all of our deals are very unique, very customized both in terms of the percentage sharing, as well as the level at which we start to share with the retail partner, and for obvious reasons, we can't provide any visibility around those contractual terms. And our retailers also have seasonality. And so there are number of moving pieces that make it difficult for you to model it and to have that transparency, so we give you a guidance range for the year. What you should be able to see from the quarterly results is that, when things get better we tend to share more, when things get worse we share less with the retail partners, that dynamic whether you're looking at it as a percent of receivables, or a percent of pre-tax earnings excluding RSA, those ratios hold, I would say, fairly consistent, but for the seasonal components that I mentioned.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Got it.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","So I know that's not particularly helpful in terms of how you're going to model it, but I would just continue to use the guidance that we're giving you. I think that's probably the best way for you guys to get it right.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Just one follow up to that. When we think about the \u2013 let's assume that it's an ROA threshold. Is it on a trailing 12 months basis, or does it true up every quarter in terms of how you accrue it?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","For the most part assume that it stood (40:49) up in the quarter.","Richard B. Shane - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. Recognizing that you don't give specific EPS guidance, can you speak to your confidence level and your ability to grow earnings in the current credit environment if the current environment holds, and you don't necessarily see further declines in unemployment, but you also don't see increases? It seems to us like your business model enables you to still be able to generate healthy EPS growth in this environment, particularly once you start layering in the upside from capital return, but I think there are some concerns around that, and we'd love to hear your thoughts.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Well, Bill, I think the fundamentals of the business are still very strong, if you, let's just walk down \u2013 we'll walk down the income statement and look at some of the key indicators. Net interest margin is stable to improving. We feel good about the margins, the resiliency of the margins, RSAs act as an offset to other things that are going on in the P&L. We drove fairly significant operating leverage, and I think we're fairly optimistic going forward that we'll be able to continue to do that, particularly given that the infrastructure growth spend, that's all in the run-rate. We're really focused on driving operating leverage going forward.","And then we're using some of the savings to invest in the long-term ideas and strategies, and things like mobile and data analytics, but this is a scalable platform, and we should be able to drive that operating leverage going forward. So then you're really left with what is the outlook on credit, and we've given you a view on that as well in terms of what we're seeing. So I'd say, you've got a whole bunch of positives, and then we're going to build reserves based on growth in the business as well as our expectation in net charge-offs, and we'll continue to do that. But I think that, that adds up to a pretty positive outlook, generally, for the business.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Thank you. That's really helpful. If I may ask one follow up on credit. Just it looks like you guys are reserved at very healthy levels. And if just looking at yourself \u2013 you guys relative to peers, Capital One, which reported last night is running with reserve coverage of about 12 months in its domestic card segment, while you guys are running, well, north of that, you have less subprime exposure. Can you help us understand why you guys are running with what looks to be relatively higher reserve coverage versus some others?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Well, obviously, I can't speak to how others reserve, that I can't do, but I can tell you that our reserve is based on our best estimate of the incurred losses that we believe exist in the book at the end of the reporting period. Our models generally look out over a 12-month window. They include our expectations for net charge-offs. We also include qualitative and other factors. And our reserve coverage, we don't book to a specific number of months, but it typically falls in that 13 months to 15 months of expected net charge-offs. So other than that, I mean, there is some really good disclosure in the Q is that, you can look at that kind of talks about the other factors that we build in, but tough for me to compare. I don't really have visibility into what others do.","Bill Carcache - Nomura Securities International, Inc.","Understood. Thank you very much.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson.","Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. In terms of the platforms, Payment Solutions continues to somewhat grow a bit faster. Is that a function of folks looking for the deferred interest products, or is it more a function of just adding higher number of partners in that over the past year?","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I actually think it's a couple of things. We've had great success in winning more partners there for sure. The second is, we've put a fairly robust marketing strategy in place there to actually get brief (45:08) on the card. So if you went back four years or five years ago in that particular platform, we used to describe it as, you bought the product and you were done. We now, do fairly sophisticated marketing using our analytics to get customers to go back and repurchase, so that's another positive. I think, generally speaking, the other positive is, a lot of the products within Payment Solutions are related to home, and we definitely have seen that trend of home being positive where people are investing back in their homes. So I think, we've seen a positive momentum in that business, really for the last probably 12 months to 15 months, and it's just continuing.","Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Thanks. And I guess, in terms of the \u2013 we're hearing from other issuers of the competitive environment, maybe more so related to the Retail Card side, seems to be increasing a bit over the past three months to six months, it's I guess, no big surprise, but I'm curious as to what you're saying from a competitive standpoint.","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, I think, it's been the same personally. I think, the players are the same players. You kind of get people come and go within that segment. I don't think it's hypercompetitive. I think, \u2013 listen, you need to ensure that you're building and investing in areas that are really going to help the partners. I think as you read, it's pretty 2% to 3% retail growth. So everyone is looking to try to get that customer back in there. We feel that, we have all the right aspects to compete effectively in the space. We're not going to win every deal, nor would we want to win every deal. So in the context of the overall market and what's available, we feel like we're winning the deals we want to win.","Arren Cyganovich - D. A. Davidson & Co.","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Yeah. Thanks. I wanted to drill down a little more, Brian, as you commented on operating leverage in the business. I understand your guidance on the efficiency ratio for 2016. But just hoping if you can give us a little bit more to think about the kind of longer-term outlook for the efficiency ratio, and what kind of investments you need to make to continue to sustain growth from the business?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Well, I would say, generally the level of investment will be fairly consistent with what we've been doing in the past few years. Investing in long-term growth, I guess is not a new concept for us, we've been doing that for quite some time. I think that's why we have the growth rates that we do, and we continue to win and renew our partnerships. What I would tell you is, we're very focused on driving operating leverage, you saw that in the first half of this year. It's a scalable business. I mentioned the infrastructure cost and the run rate earlier. We'll continue to drive operating leverage. But as we get more efficient across the business, we're always running productivity initiatives, and we're looking at moving more customers off of paper statements to online statements. We're improving our call center and collections efficiency metrics. And so we're working on eliminating waste in the backoffice, things like that, and that results in real operating leverage and real productivity.","And then in parallel with that, we look at things that we feel like we need to invest in to be very a successful business for the next 10 years to 15 years. And those are things that, some of the things that Margaret talked about, investing in mobile capabilities which is something we've been doing for four years or five years, data analytics, CRM, I mean, this is a rapidly changing industry, and we've got to stay on top of those things. But even after you take those incremental investments into account, we would expect to and we would hope to continue to generate positive operating leverage. That doesn't mean we're going to generate positive operating leverage every quarter. We're not going to pass up a good long-term strategic investment to show a few basis points improvement on the efficiency ratio in any one quarter, but over the long-term, this is a big focus for us and for the management team.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. And just one clarifying question on the guidance itself. I think you indicated, remain below 34% on the back half. Are you talking about each quarter should remain below 34%, so the full year average probably remains below 33%, or you just saying, you're still sticking with the full year below 34%?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","We're sticking with the full year below 34%. Thanks for the clarification.","Mark C. DeVries - Barclays Capital, Inc.","Okay. Thanks.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Great. Thanks. Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered. But maybe just a follow up on credit, could you talk a little bit about the industry setting, and \u2013 because you've got more, I would say, more issuers also talking about the seasoning of their portfolios. Do you think that this kind of helps or hurts if others are in somewhat similar positions, and can you just talk about how that might affect yours and the industry going forward?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Well, hard for me to comment on what others are saying. I think the trends are \u2013 and the commentary seems to be fairly consistent, which is I think that the backdrop is still pretty healthy. I think the consumer is still generally healthy. The overall macro environment is pretty strong. With that said, the consumer continues to take on more debt. They continue to take on more leverage, and while it appears to be modest, and it looks like the overall levels are still pretty reasonable and pretty responsible. It's something we're watching carefully, I think others are watching it carefully as well. So our forecast includes that trend. It also includes the other factors that I mentioned, portfolio mix and mix by program and channel and other things. We believe this is going to result in a gradual increase and charge-offs over time. Some of that is seasoning, but as I mentioned earlier, I think seasoning, while everybody has on a vintage similar seasoning patterns, depending on the growth rates and the consistency of the growth rates, you could end up with a very different result depending on the issuer. And so I think, while that is a factor we have certainly considered in our outlook, it gets place maybe less overall (51:50) for us as it does with some others.","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Okay. Great. Thanks. And maybe just a little bit of, kind of an update in terms of some of the new potential activities on the CareCredit front.","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. So CareCredit is a great platform. It's one that we want to grow. So in addition to always signing up and winning new partnerships, which is key, the second area that we're focused on is really the utility of the card. So we're continuing to look at ways, and actually that consumers will have that card are looking to use the card more. So things like our partnership with Rite Aid, and you'll see more of those types of partnerships come out. We have a 50%, we use on that product, which is very high. We're looking at some additional industries that we might want to expand in, as well as, our biggest opportunity really in CareCredit is just getting more of what's in a partner's office. So if you think of dental as an example, it's getting more of those patients who come in to utilize the payment methodology of CareCredit. So we're working on some initiatives around that to really \u2013 similar to retail, increase our penetration in the office, of the card. So lots of activity going on there, lots of great marketing. We feel very positive about that business, and it might be a little kudos (53:24), but it's a growing kudos (53:25).","Moshe Ari Orenbuch - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker)","Got it. Thanks.","Operator","And thank you. And our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, I had a follow up to really those questions on the pipeline in ROA. Margaret, as we think about the verticals you are targeting, and specifically T&E has been mentioned the last couple of quarters as a priority, you just signed up Cathay. More holistically, as we think about the T&E vertical, airlines, hotels and the like, and other verticals that are in your target area, is the profile or the mix of Dual Card in in-store going to materially change over the next few years? Should we be thinking about the profile changing, particularly as the T&E sector seems to be obviously, almost exclusively (54:33)?","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, we look at \u2013 no, I would say, no. Dual Card is still a very important aspect of our business. We'll, I think generally speaking in our overall portfolio, we always prefer if we can have a private label card and a Dual Card in our retail segment, because it allows us to really grow that portfolio. In terms of the co-brand aspect of our business, we're really trying to take some of the learning set of our retail Dual Card space and leverage that across some of these opportunities on T&E side, and driving value props, and even how you sign up and using mobile and digital as a way to really advance there. As Brian said, we're not looking to be the next big co-brand company, that's not our strategy, but we think opportunistically in a way for us to grow the business is really to look for these other opportunities, and take our capabilities that we have, and leveraging those in some of these new markets.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful. And then lastly, just one more follow up on credit. In the broader topic of curing later stage delinquencies, which was highlighted last month. Has there been any \u2013 is there any either internal change or external regulatory changes regarding call center activity, how active your delinquency management is, and anything on the collection front? And then in addition, can you provide some color whether historically you've sold many charge-offs, and how that mix plays into the recovery factor?","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah, sure. So on the first one, I would say, generally we're always making improvements and refinements to our collection strategies. We're fully compliant with the applicable regulatory guidance, whether it's TCPA or whatever it is, and obviously those have some impact on our ability to collect. But I would not highlight them as being overly significant in terms of the overall results. There are things that we adapt to along with the rest of the industry and we make other improvements to work offset to those. In terms of recoveries, I would just reiterate what I said earlier, the overall recovery rate, which includes a combination of what we collect in-house as well as what we sell, it has been pretty consistent. If you look over the past two years, it's been right around 1.1% to 1.2% of average receivables. It's little bit higher this quarter. We think it comes back down into that kind of two-year average going forward.","David M. Scharf - JMP Securities LLC","Got it. Thank you.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah.","Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations","Hey Vanessa, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And thank you. Our last question will come from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Thank you. Good morning. I guess, I have a follow-up question on credit. It sounds now like you guys are talking about more normalization of losses versus some kind of specific stress as it might have sounded like at a recent conference. So maybe you could just talk about how you delineate the line between stress versus normalization. I think that would be really helpful.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Yeah. Sure, Sanjay. So in June our comments indicated that we were expecting to see this modest increase in net charge-offs over the next 12 months. To us that's normalization. I think, others may have viewed it differently. And as part of that dialogue, we focus more specifically around the payment behaviors that were driving the reserve builds specifically in the quarter, that was the guidance we were providing. Now, I think we're trying to give you some broader context on items in the forecast that obviously influence the forecast, and items that drive some of that payment behavior that we're seeing, that the forecast includes things like portfolio mix by platform, by product, program channel. Well, seasoning is not as big for us, as I mentioned, as I think it may be for some others, that's included in our outlook as well, and we're also factoring the trends that we are seeing on the consumer.","And I would just reiterate what I said earlier, that the consumer broadly is still generally healthy. We said all last year that we didn't think the consumer would get better, and they continued to get better all last year, and now we're seeing those improvements subside. But the overall macro-environment is still pretty strong. The thing that we're watching is the thing that I mentioned earlier, that the consumer continues to take on more leverage. It appears to be responsible at this point. The overall levels are reasonable if you look at, I mean, historic context. But it's something that we're watching carefully. And as we mentioned, we're watching what's going on in other asset classes as well, and looking at the layered risks. So our forecast includes that trend continuing, as well as the items I mentioned earlier.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Okay. My follow up Margaret is just on the pipeline. I know you were asked the question, you characterized it as robust. But maybe you could just talk about the probability of something large happening over the near term. I mean, do you feel like that's the possibility?","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","We'd love to have a big win. As I said earlier, we're going to continue to be disciplined and ensure that whatever we do win is a positive for the overall portfolio. We're competing on our capabilities, and we think in that particular area we're very strong, and we'll play out the opportunities that are out there.","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.","Margaret M. Keane - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Brian D. Doubles - Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer","Thanks, Sanjay.","Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations","Hey, thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial.

Overall, solid momentum continued across each of our business platforms driving strong double-digit growth in purchase volume, loan receivables and platform revenue this quarter. Compared to the first quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 17% and platform revenue and loan receivables grew 13%. We continue to see strong growth in our online and mobile purchase volume. Our online and mobile sales growth has been steadily accelerating and first quarter sales grew 29% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 14% to 15% range.","Asset quality metrics were relatively stable this quarter in line with our expectations. 30-plus day delinquencies were 3.85% and our net charge-off rate was 4.7% in the range of losses we have experienced in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Expenses were in line with our expectations increasing 7% over last year. This was largely driven by investments we made in support of our growth initiatives. However, our overall efficiency ratio improved 1.8 percentage points to 30.4%, reflecting our strong revenue growth this quarter. Our receivables growth is supported by continued deposit growth, which grew $10 billion or 29% to $45 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprised 69% of our funding sources at the high end of our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results. And at this point, you can expect for us to grow a little beyond that original target range.","One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full-scale online bank. We plan to launch new product offerings later this year, which will augment growth and enhance the retention of our deposit base. Given the significant growth in deposits, we were able to fully pay off our bank term loan on April 5. We are pleased that we were able to pay off this loan well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019.","Our balance sheet remained strong, with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.1% calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end. We renewed several key relationships during the quarter, including Stein Mart and La-Z-Boy. We also signed a new partnership with Marvel and recently launched the Marvel MasterCard with an attractive cash-back value proposition. We are further leveraging this relationship by developing creative ways to market our deposit products to the Marvel fan base. The new value proposition delivers the greatest benefit on leisure activities, including dining out, movies, concerts and amusement parks. Cardholders receive 3% cash-back on spending in these types of categories and 1% cash-back on other purchases.","We are excited about this partnership and the value this new card will bring to loyal Marvel fans and others who enjoy the benefit of a cash-back program. The partnership will also offer a unique opportunity to co-promote our deposit products in conjunction with the Marvel feature film. We launched a new campaign called Save Like a Hero which will feature Synchrony Bank saving products and be tied to the release of Marvel\u2019s new Captain America movie. This is the second starter program we have rolled out in the travel and entertainment space. You will recall that last quarter we also launched our Stash Hotel Rewards program. We think this is an area that provides attractive opportunities.","During the quarter, we also launched our new Citgo card program. Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the 5,000 plus locally owned and operated Citgo locations in the United States. We continue to work with our partners, new and existing, to develop compelling value propositions for their cardholders. This quarter, we launched a new value prop with Walmart. The program brings even more value to the everyday purchases customers make using their Walmart cards. The 3-2-1 Save cash-back program provides qualifying cardholders the opportunity to earn rewards for purchases they make everyday, including 3% back on purchases made on walmart.com, 2% back on fuel purchases at Walmart and Murphy USA gas stations and 1% back on purchases made at Walmart stores and everywhere that Walmart cards are accepted. The 3-2-1 Save program simplifies and strengthens the card proposition for Walmart cardholders. We work closely with Walmart to meet the evolving needs of their customers and we are excited about this program as it also recognizes the increasing move to online and mobile shopping. It is the first credit card program designed to offer Walmart cardholders even greater savings on their online purchases. We are highly focused on innovating ways to drive organic growth as it remains a key priority and opportunity. We continue to work closely with our partners to deliver growth across all sales channels.","Moving to Slide 4 which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 13% primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 17% and average active account growth of 7%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the annual growth rate. Platform revenue increased 13% over the first quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers that deliver value to our partners and customers.","On the next slide, I will discuss this quarter\u2019s performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to deliver solid performance across all three of our sales platforms in the first quarter. Retail Card generated especially strong results this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 17% and receivables grew 14%. The addition of BP in the second quarter of last year also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 15%. The strong growth in Retail Card was broad-based as we saw growth across our partner programs. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter in Retail Card. We renewed and extended the Stein Mart program. We signed a new partnership with Marvel and launched the new Marvel MasterCard this month and we launched the new value proposition with Walmart, the 3-2-1 Save cash-back program. The position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth.","Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 15% and receivables grew 13% driving platform revenue growth of 14%. Average active accounts increased 12% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products. We renewed a key home furnishing relationship with the extension of our La-Z-Boy partnership.","We continue to expand card reuse and payment solutions, with repeat purchase volume growing 18% year-over-year. Reuse represented 27% of purchase volume in the first quarter. CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Purchase volume was up 14% and receivables grew 9%, driving platform revenue growth of 6%. Average active accounts increased 7% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Card reuse continues to be an area of focus in CareCredit and purchase volume from repeat usage on the card grew 17% compared to last year. Reuse represented 50% of purchase volume in the quarter. Our CareCredit digital innovations continue to resonate with cardholders. The CareCredit app has been downloaded more than 350,000x and visited more than 2.3 million times since we launched it last fall. In addition, our provider locator averaged more than 800,000 hits per month in the first quarter. In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth.","I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.","Brian Doubles","Thanks Margaret. I will start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the first quarter, the business earned $582 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter. This compares to $552 million or $0.66 per diluted share last year. We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volumes up 17%, receivables up 13% and platform revenue up 13%. Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see this in average spend, with purchase volume per average active account increasing 9% over last year as well as growth in average balance per active account up 4% compared to last year. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter last year, so that helped to improve our growth rate year-over-year.","Net interest income was up 12% in the quarter, mainly driven by the growth in receivables. RSAs were up slightly, $10 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.0% for the quarter compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to higher provision expense associated with growth in the programs as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. We typically see the RSA decline from the fourth quarter due to lower post-holiday related volumes. We still expect the RSA benefit on a full year basis to trend slightly under 4.5%. The provision increased $216 million compared to last year. While the increase was driven by receivables growth, we also had the benefit of a lower reserve build last year due to improved asset quality metrics. I will cover this in more in detail later.","Asset quality metrics were relatively stable. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% compared to 3.79% last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.70% compared to 4.53% last year. Credit metrics were in line with our expectations and consistent with the range we have seen in the first quarter over the past 2 years. Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of our receivables was 5.5%. Measured against the last four quarters\u2019 net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3x, which is consistent with the coverage level over the past six quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were stable.","Other income decreased $9 million versus last year. Higher loyalty and rewards costs were partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $30 million, driven by continued growth in our store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $32 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through the RSAs, so there was a partial offset on each of these items. Debt cancellation fees of $64 million were down $1 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel.","Other expenses increased $54 million or 7% versus last year, more in line with the growth of the business. Now that we are comparing the periods where the infrastructure build is largely in the run rate, we expect going forward expenses to be driven largely by growth as well as strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.4%. The first quarter is typically the low point for the efficiency ratio due to marketing, business development and volume related expenses being at their lowest level for the year. The efficiency ratio will normally increase from these levels for the remainder of the year. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our strong performance drove a solid quarter generating an ROA of 2.8%.","I will move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.76% for the quarter, relatively stable to last year and the prior quarter. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The yield on receivables declined 21 basis points to 21.1%, reflecting higher payment rates and a slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions, where the yield is lower than our overall portfolio yield. The decline in receivables yield was offset by a slight benefit from rates earned in our liquidity portfolio due to higher short-term benchmark rates resulting from the Fed tightening in December. We also benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average this quarter as we used excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan facility.","The cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.9% due to an increase from rising short-term benchmark rates and the costs of the senior unsecured debt issuance, which was largely offset by a higher mix of lower-cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan and the payoff for the GE Capital loan last year. Our deposit base increased by over $10 billion or 29% year-over-year, we are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 69% of our funding versus 59% last year. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance.","Next, I will cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continue to see relatively stable asset quality performance, which was generally in line with our expectations. 30-plus delinquencies were 3.85% versus 3.79% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.84% compared to 1.81% in the prior year. The net charge-off rate was 4.7% compared to 4.53% in the first quarter last year. Both the delinquency metrics and net charge-off levels are consistent with the results in the first quarter of 2014 and 2015. We continued to believe their performance is being sustained due in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.5%, down slightly from 5.59% last year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months\u2019 charge-offs, we are currently at 1.3x coverage, which equates to roughly 15.5 months loss coverage in our reserve, which is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we are seeing.","Moving to Slide 9, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continue to be in line with our expectations. Expenses came in at $800 million for the quarter, a 7% increase over last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $41 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were down $16 million, driven primarily by lower third party expense as a result of our completion of the separation from GE. Marketing and business development costs were up $12 million. The higher costs were driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped to drive the strong growth in purchase volume receivables. Information processing was up $19 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter due to seasonal low points in marketing, business development and volume related expenses. We expect the ratio to trend up from this level during the remainder of the year. However, we expect it to remain below 34% in line with what we communicated back in January.","Moving to Slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continued to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we have grown our deposits by over $10 billion primarily for our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 69% of our funding, which is near the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded. And while we have now moved further towards the top end of our target leverage, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year such as checking and online bill pay. Given we are near the top end of our range and we expect to continue to drive deposit growth, we would expect deposits to move a little above 70% of our funding in the upcoming quarters. Longer term, once we reach our optimal mix of deposits, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivable growth.","Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 19% of our funding. In March, we successfully issued $750 million in 3-year notes. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization of between 15% to 20% of our total funding. Our third-party debt, bank term loan and senior unsecured notes now total 12% of our funding sources. As we said in the past, our strategy was to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this would become a more expensive source of funding for the business as rates start to rise. Given the significant growth in deposits, we made $2.7 billion of prepayments in the quarter and paid off the remaining $1.5 billion in early April. We are pleased to have fully paid this loan up well ahead of its contractual maturity in 2019. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.","Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18.1%, CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 17.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.4% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of 110 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $22.2 billion and includes $14.9 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $7.3 billion undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.","I would also like to provide an update on our capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March and we submitted the plan to the Fed in early April. This is in line with the timeline we have communicated on previous calls. Overall, we are executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We have built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels.","And with that, I will turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I will close with a summary of the quarter on Slide 11 and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter, we exhibited broad-based growth across key areas, signed and renewed important partnerships and expanded our network in the utility of our cards and continued to develop innovative solutions and value propositions to help drive sales. And our pipeline of additional opportunities remains strong. Our digital channels remain a key component of our overall strategy and we delivered strong growth both online and through our native app. We are pleased with the ongoing success of our fast growing deposit platforms and strong balance sheet.","I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning guys.","Margaret Keane","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Maybe we could start with your expectations for credit, first we did see charge-offs up slightly year-on-year, but yet still down from 2014 levels. And I was wondering is there any change to your call it relatively stable 430 to 450 guidance? And if not \u2013 and if so, how do we think about the trajectory of both provisions and charge-offs over the next few quarters?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure Ryan. So, I think it still feels like we are operating in a pretty stable environment when it comes to credit. We continue to think that losses will be stable for the balance of the year. We have been pretty clear that we don\u2019t expect them to get better from here. I think that\u2019s pretty consistent across the industry. If you look at the performance in the quarter, it was largely in line with our expectations. If you look at the year-over-year comparison, you have to remember that we had a really strong first quarter last year, which was frankly is better than we expected. We only had a $19 million reserve build in the first quarter last year. So, really what you are seeing now is more of a normalization and generally more in line with our expectations. So, if you look at reserve coverage levels, they are also very consistent. Reserve coverage as a percent of receivables was 5.5%. It was down just 9 basis points from last year. If you look at the reserve coverage against last 12 months charge-offs, it was 1.29x versus 1.26x a year ago, so also very consistent. So, I think for the balance of the year, we continue to say our losses will be stable, an overall change to that 2-year kind of average that we gave in January.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And maybe I can ask a question, Margaret, on the outlook for growth, both loan growth and the pipeline for new business wins. Maybe on loan growth, can you talk about how we should think about it from here, how much of the growth is coming from improving penetration rates versus new client wins? You highlighted a couple of times that the year-over-year growth from BP will subside next quarter. So, I just want to think \u2013 understand how to think about loan growth? And then the portfolio pipeline for new deals, can you maybe talk about potential startups and maybe any other portfolio deals that you are looking at?","Margaret Keane","Sure. I think we have said in the past that we do have BP in the numbers. So that\u2019s a little bit of the growth. But the real growth is coming from organic growth and increased penetration. And throughout CareCredit 50% of the sales are repeat and Payment Solutions, we are seeing nice repeat. I think one of the key drivers of our results is really two things. One is the value props that we continue to enhance and drive into our retailers and we work closely with them to really develop those value propositions. And going back to what Brian saying about the consumer being stable on credit, I do think consumers continue to look for a reason to shop. So, having very strong value propositions is really key. The second is really all the innovation we continue to do on mobile. Our online sales overall, were up 29% year-over-year in the quarter, which is really a testament to the ability to apply and buy I think. And you combine that with the strong value propositions. I think this is why you are really seeing the kind of growth you are seeing. So, I would say most of it is through existing cardholders who are deepening their loyalty to the brand of that particular retailer. On the pipeline itself, our pipeline continues to remain robust. It\u2019s really a mix, I would say of startups as well as existing portfolios that we are looking to win. It\u2019s a combination of both. We have, as I said in the past, dedicated resources in all three platforms. We are working on our network, so in CareCredit being able to add RiteAid things like that. So very focused on the front end on winning deals and feel we have a good pipeline going forward.","Ryan Nash","Just as a very, very quick follow-up, have you disclosed what percentage of overall sales are mobile and online, just I am trying to get a sense for how fast that grew over the next few years?","Margaret Keane","Yes, we just do the combined digital, which is the 29%. And again, the bulk of the sales are still in store obviously, because that\u2019s the bulk of where people just continue to shop, but this metric continues to excel. And probably one of the case is when we see a consumer shop multi-channel, we definitely get higher penetration on the cards. So, if they shop in-store and online, for example, we know they are more loyal and intend to stay longer with us. So really working through all those channels is very important.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for taking my questions.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. You guys provided a lot of the factors with respect to growth in the debt, but I am wondering can you talk about active account growth and average spend level trends and how these compared to recent quarters?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, John. So, I would say the trends have picked up a little bit from recent quarters primarily around active account growth. So, the big thing for us relative to general purpose cards, we are always measuring active accounts and that obviously includes new accounts. Active accounts are more important for us, because we are trying to create those incentives for cardholders to use the card more often. We want to create value propositions that push our card more towards the top of wallet. And so if you look at purchase volume growth, about half of that came from higher spend per active account. That was up about 8.5% from the prior year and then the other half came from an increase in overall active accounts, up 7.5%. So, a lot of what we are doing around the value propositions is getting \u2013 we are getting consumers to use the card more often and they are also spending more on the card when they use it. So I think all those trends are moving \u2013 continue to move in the right direction, but they did get incrementally better this quarter from where we have been trending.","John Hecht","Okay. Thanks Brian. And you talked about the RSA and the seasonality and so forth. Is it \u2013 in thinking about the seasonality going forward, should we just think it kind of moves up so it ends up in the range of guidance throughout the year. And the second question with respect to the RSA business, 3-2-1 program at Walmart impact that at all?","Brian Doubles","Yes. So let me just take the first one. The RSA would typically be fairly stable in the first half of the year. As I mentioned, just given we had a very small reserve build last year, and when that happens, our partners benefit from that. So if you compare against last year, we had a higher RSA percentage last year than what you saw. The RSA this quarter is actually probably more in line with what you should expect going forward. It\u2019s pretty stable in the second quarter. And then we always see a seasonal increase in the RSA percentage in the third quarter and it comes down a bit in the fourth quarter, but it is typically elevated in the second half of the year. And then your second question on Walmart, you will see \u2013 depending on how that plays out, it\u2019s still very early, but you will see any time we launch a value proposition, you typically see loyalty costs, interchange will increase and there is a partial offset in the RSA for those items. But I would continue to use slightly below 4.5% range for the year that we gave you.","John Hecht","Alright. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I know it\u2019s the first quarter, but the NIM is trending better than your guidance, is it fair to say that there is some upside given that trend, similar question for the efficiency ratio, understanding the seasonality, but can we hold kind of the year-over-year increase in that ratio?","Brian Doubles","Yes. So let me just take NIM first. It was slightly above the 15.5% outlook due to the fact that we had really strong deposit growth. We did use some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loan. So when you look at the average liquidity in the quarter compared to last year, it was a little bit lower. So those are all positives and some of those were factored in the guidance we gave you and some of them came in a little bit better. I think as you think about the rest of the year, if deposit growth continues at this pace, we could see some benefit there in our margins. We are always looking at ways to optimize liquidity, so there could be a slight benefit there. However, there would probably be a couple of offsets. One is we continue to see really strong growth in Payment Solutions. You saw that this quarter. And so you will see a little bit of an offset in our receivable yields. And then our guidance did include, if you remember, it included 50 basis points of Fed rate increases in the back half of the year. We had those in June and December. And so the markets pricing and maybe one rate increase. So that would be just a little bit of pressure on the guidance. So I think there are some put and takes, I wouldn\u2019t think about the margin for the balance of the year trending too significantly in either direction from the 15.76 we reported this quarter.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Efficiency ratio?","Brian Doubles","Yes. And then on the efficiency ratio, obviously is very strong in the quarter, 30.4%. it\u2019s definitely going to trend up from here. There is no question. We benefited from having very strong revenue growth in the quarter. We didn\u2019t spend a lot on marketing and strategic investments. Those typically accelerate throughout the balance of the year. I m not going to give you any more specific guidance and we feel really good particularly how we started the year that we will stay below the annual guidance of below 34%. So I think that is \u2013 that\u2019s definitely a good number. We are really pleased with how we started the year, but I am not going to give any more specifics than what we said back in January.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Got it. Just one final question for Margaret, I guess one of the concerns I heard during the quarter and just a follow-up on one of the questions asked before, was that Walmart program and possibly kind of the rising costs to issuers as it relates to enhanced rewards, I mean can you just talk about how you guys think of the that, I understand that it\u2019s a share between the merchants as well, but maybe you could just articulate kind of what you guys are thinking in terms of strategy? Thanks.","Margaret Keane","Sure first of all I think we are always looking at ways to enhance value props, right, because the ultimate goal for both us and the partner is to grow the program. And if we grow the program through the sales and receivables, we all win. So that\u2019s kind of a fundamental. Whenever we do a launch like this, obviously we work closely with a partner. And in terms of the overall economics, there is economics in these deals that we can move around and Brian can talk a little more specifically about that if you want. So for us, the more we grow the program and the more we drive loyalty in the cards through those value proposition, the better we are off as well as the partner. We are pretty excited with this particular launch because it\u2019s a program that I think aligns very close to the strategic direction of Walmart, where they really want to drive online sales. So for us, this is a program that is a big launch and one we are excited about, one that I think we can grow the overall program. And when you grow the overall program, we all win. I don\u2019t know Brian, if you would add more on the economics.","Brian Doubles","Yes. The only thing, I know you guys get this, but the costs of these value propositions run to the RSA, so the partner is sharing in the costs with us to drive growth in the program. And then the other thing that we don\u2019t talk a lot about, but we also set aside marketing and loyalty dollars in the programs and we jointly agreed with the partner on how to spend those dollars. So we can always reallocate from the marketing funds and maybe we will choose to do less one off promotions and shift some dollars into an everyday value prop. I think this is a really good example where we leverage our data analytics capabilities and we look at spending trends and customer insights to really determine the best way to use those marketing dollars to drive growth.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Pardon me, Betsy your line is open, perhaps you are muted.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, yes. Sorry, it\u2019s muted. Sorry. Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So a couple of questions, one on the deposit side, you indicated that you have your goals on deposit funding, just wondering how close you believe you are to that and what would keep you from wanting to increase deposits as a percentage of total funding from here?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure Betsy. So we obviously continue to have really strong deposit growth. We are up $10 billion year-over-year or 29%. It\u2019s been fairly consistent over the past few quarters. I think the only new dynamic is that we did see an influent deposits this quarter when the Fed raised rates. We didn\u2019t move our rates, but I think the announcement of a rate hike prompted people to go check what they were earning in traditional savings account. And they decided to move some money around. So we did see a benefit from that in the quarter. In terms of the target range, we are at 69% of our total funding. We gave you a range of between 60% to 70%. So we are at the high end right now. In my earlier comments, I indicated that we are going to continue to grow deposits. We will probably grow deposits faster than we are growing our receivables, at least based on the market conditions that we see right now. So I would expect that deposit percentage to trend a little above 70% in the next few quarters. And then we are always looking at whether or not we should revisit that target and maybe take it up a little bit, but I think we are going to see how the rest of the year plays out before we do anything there.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And I would think your deposit growth is adding low cost funding relative to the other funding mix that you have got, so you are using that to drive incremental loan growth that is potentially a little more competitive. In other words, you are using the cheaper funding cost to drive more loan growth that is maybe a little bit more skewed towards value to your partners, is that fair?","Brian Doubles","Well, I think \u2013 if you think about the loan growth we are driving, it\u2019s been pretty consistent. If you just look at the straight receivable yield, it\u2019s pretty flat year-over-year, that was down 21 basis points. And that \u2013 again that\u2019s primarily driven by higher payment rates that we are seeing across the portfolio and then more growth in Payment Solutions. So I wouldn\u2019t attribute really any of it to the competitive environment. If you look at loyalty cost and you really have to look at loyalty costs in conjunction with the RSA and some of the marketing spend. We are going to continue to launch attractive value proposition to drive growth. I wouldn\u2019t think about it direct tie-in with deposits. We are kind of \u2013 we look at them separately. We are trying to fund the balance sheet in a very cost effective way and deposits are very cost effective for us. We are going to continue to drive deposits. And then we are making different decisions when we look at the retail programs and how to drive growth. So, our yields should continue to be pretty stable, but for the two dynamics that I mentioned earlier, really strong growth in Payment Solutions and slightly higher payment rates.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And the just a follow-up on the credit questions that you got earlier, it sounded to me like 1Q result in NCS was more seasonal, I know we saw in the master trust data March improved versus February. So, my takeaway is that seasonality should drive down the NCS as we move into second and third quarter. I don\u2019t know if you would agree with that. And maybe you could speak to the fact that delinquencies have been coming down in the 30-day and 90-day buckets and what the implications are for the forward look from your perspective?","Brian Doubles","Yes. If you remember back in January, we tried to be pretty clear that we didn\u2019t expect the favorability we saw kind of in the first half of 2015 to continue when we gave you how to think about the provision. And if you look at \u2013 so, if you look at the net charge-offs in the quarter, I just go back in the first quarter of 2014, net charge-offs were 4.86%. In the first quarter of 2015, they were 4.53% and we are at 4.7% this quarter, so smacked out in the middle of that range that we gave you back in January. So, I think that was pretty good guidance and we came in right in line with our expectations and that\u2019s why we gave you a range for the year. We said credit will be stable, but it will be stable to like a 2-year range in that 4.3% to 4.5% kind of level. And reserves will grow in line with receivables and that\u2019s absolutely what we saw this quarter and you are seeing very stable reserve coverage metrics.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. Brian, you talked about the breakdown of kind of existing accounts versus kind of new accounts in the spending. I guess maybe to be a little bit more basic, the 17% obviously benefited this quarter by the leap year and there might have been some funky things a year ago. What do you think the underlying actual growth rate is and maybe talk a little bit about your share at retailers and how that\u2019s moving?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So, if you adjust for day count, purchase volume will move from 17% to 15% growth. Year-over-year, platform revenue will move from 13% to 12%. So, that\u2019s the impact I think even adjusting for day count, we had really strong growth in the quarter. The purchase volume per average active was up, so consumer spending more average balance per active account was up as well. So, we are still seeing good revolve on the accounts. Overall, very positive trends. I think the thing to think about as you try and figure out the back half of the year starting in the second quarter, the comps will get a little bit tougher for us. We have got the BP portfolio, Guitar Center we also had the Amazon 5% value prop. So, you got to factor those in as you think about the second half of the year, but we are really pleased with how we started. We didn\u2019t get a ton of help from retail sales. They were pretty much more the same, more of what we have been seeing. So, we are definitely taking share. We are definitely outperforming. If you look at the total credit card balances over the past 5 years, it\u2019s about $900 billion of balances and they have been growing it about 3%. Our growth over that same time period is 9%. And so there is no question that we are taking share in the market.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. And you had mentioned Citgo, are there other programs that are going to be kind of ramping in the second half?","Brian Doubles","No, I think that\u2019s the one. And again it\u2019s a relatively modest deal. So, we will have probably a tougher comp from BP and Guitar Center. Citgo won\u2019t totally offset that. So, the comp will get tougher, but the core organic growth is really strong and we obviously hope to have some more program wins in the back half of the year and we will announce those when we get them done.","Moshe Orenbuch","Maybe from a big picture perspective, you talked a little bit about the Walmart program and the sharing of the RSA, so maybe you just talk philosophically about that kind of a relationship versus program relationship with how it might be different in addition to just the shares in RSA?","Margaret Keane","Yes, I think probably the key thing or the difference between the co-brand and the pure like Walmart example is really the engagement that you really get at the top. And I think in all of our big programs, the most important thing is for us to really connect with the strategy that, that particular retailer or partner is really trying to drive. And so the engagement both from an analytics and marketing perspective is just so high. You don\u2019t necessarily always get that same connection when you are doing the co-brand. So, I think that makes a big difference. I think the other thing that all retailers are really facing is how do they reach out to their target markets. And I think the fact that we had this 29% online growth overall year-over-year is certainly a way for us to really continue to connect with the partners, because the reality is consumers are shopping differently. So, I think really be engaged at the strategy level with the retailer is probably one of the, I think bigger differences between what we are doing on that side versus generic co-brand.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. I had a follow-up question, Brian, on the seasonality that you talked about on Slide 8. So, it looks like the allowance, the reserve rate is essentially peaks in the first quarter and we saw that in \u201815 and then it kind of gradually decreases again before peaking in the first quarter of the next year. And as we have been looking at year-over-year trends that reserve rate has actually been following every single one of the periods that are shown here. And similarly first quarter \u201816 fell over first quarter \u201815. But at some point, should we expect the year-over-year to reflect an increase similar to kind of what the charge-off rates up above. We had been seeing year-over-year declines. Now this quarter we saw year-over-year increase. So, when should we for modeling purposes expect that to happen for the reserve rate as well?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Well, if you go back to what we said in January, we pretty much indicated that we thought the coverage metrics would be stable. So, if you go back and compare against the prior year, we are seeing that stability. So, even though we saw 9 basis points of improvement or I guess the lowering of the reserve coverage from the first quarter \u201815 to the first quarter \u201816, from our perspective that\u2019s like dead stable. That\u2019s very consistent. And so I think you are going to start to see that normalization as you go and compare the prior quarter from the prior year. So, I think you are seeing it now. I would tell you to look at both the reserve coverage as a percent of the receivables as well as look at the reserves as a percent of or against last 12 months in net charge-offs. And if you triangulate those two, we think they will be pretty stable for the balance of the year.","Bill Carcache","Great, thanks. And if I may an industry level question for you, Margaret, so there has been, I guess a lot of focus on the friction in the payments ecosystem that certain players like PayPal have created by getting customers to fund their PayPal accounts with their bank accounts effectively disintermediating Visa and MasterCard and their issuing bank partners. And if you extend that thought process part of the Synchrony value proposition to its retail partners is not charging interchange on their private label transactions. And in the sense, one could argue that private label is effectively disintermediating general purpose cards, but there doesn\u2019t \u2013 and of course, we have seen some private label market share gains over the last decade or so, but there doesn\u2019t seem to be as much friction between Synchrony and Visa MasterCard and their issuing bank partners. So, I was hoping maybe you could just speak to the health of your relationship with the payment networks and then maybe also just touch on some of those dynamics.","Margaret Keane","Sure. I think we are working very closely with all those guys. I think at the end of the day, how a consumer is going to decide how they make their payment is going to be up to them, right? So, I think the position we have taken is that all of the players that you talked about are really partners of ours, including PayPal by the way, where we offer our credit programs. So for us, it\u2019s really about getting our cards in the wallet, whatever that wallet is, to be top of wallet and to get consumer to use it more. And I think the connection we have with merchants I think is very different than many of the players out there. And I think that\u2019s the value we bring even to some of the partners you talked about, like Visa or MasterCard and PayPal, right? So, we have that very tight connection with the merchant. And so we see this all as upside for us and continue to see that whole payment landscape as an opportunity for us to be in the forefront and continue to invest and we will continue to invest to be leaders in that.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Thanks. Good morning. Just circling back on the credit, Margaret, have we seen some \u2013 within the industry some pressure from merchants, retailers to basically increase the funnel, widen that out a little bit to drive volumes and maybe a little tick up in non-prime credit duration for those customers, down in the lower FICO spectrums, can you remind us how you guys tend to offset this with existing partners or with new RFPs or de novo and are you seeing that pressure to be a little looser on credit?","Margaret Keane","We are not seeing that. Our partners are not asking us to go deeper. I think we have been very consistent since the crisis in our underwriting. We have not changed underwriting. Our portfolio has remained fairly consistent since 2011. So I think this is where the goal should be not going necessarily deeper, but ensuring that you are bringing the value and sales in an up way through marketing, through being innovative, through driving channel integration and really working it that way. We control underwriting. It\u2019s something that we feel we have to do when we to our contracts. So that\u2019s something that I think is really important from a safety and soundness perspective from our bank. And we work with the retailers. There is many other ways to grow programs without having to necessarily always dig deeper. And I don\u2019t know Brian, if you had mentioned really how the portfolio...","Brian Doubles","Yes. I mean the underwriting profile is very consistent with where it\u2019s been and the average FICO by account is 711, exactly flat to last year. 78% of the new accounts since 2010 our prime credits above 660 FICO. And that\u2019s flat to last year as well. So the overall credit profile continues to be very stable.","David Ho","That\u2019s helpful. And separately on Amazon, obviously you have gotten some really nice digital online growth. Now, are you seeing that volume come in as transactors versus revolvers and the reason I ask is obviously it\u2019s a private label program, so you don\u2019t earn any interchange, but you are obviously paying fairly high rewards. So part of that does get offset in the RSA realized, but are you getting the revolved activity that you were expecting in that relationship?","Brian Doubles","Yes. When we \u2013 obviously, when we launched that new value proposition, we did a lot of modeling initially because we knew that through the door population and people applying for the accounts was going to change. And so that\u2019s part of the reason why, if you remember, when we launched it, we launched it with a soft launch because we wanted to monitor the mix of consumers and we wanted to make sure that we were sizing lines appropriately, that it was a good experience for the prime customer that we are generating increment sales for Amazon. And so we have a lot of things that we are measuring. But one of the big ones for the credit program was revolver versus transactors. And we have monitored. It\u2019s coming in pretty close to what we forecast. So far, very much in line with our expectations. And obviously, the point you made is a good one which is part of why you see loyalty expense growing a little bit faster than interchange because that\u2019s the program where we do have a very attractive value proposition, but we don\u2019t charge interchange to Amazon. So there is an offset in the RSA. It\u2019s all part of that restructuring of that agreement and part of the extension that we do at Amazon when we launch the new value proposition.","David Ho","Sure. And one more follow-up on that if I may, are you seeing a general trend broadly that merchants are more willing to fund a larger portion of the value from the high rewards earned now that they have seen \u2013 that they have gotten some good engagement and account activity?","Margaret Keane","I think that varies retailer by retailer, but I think if you take the whole formula of what we do, the retailer is always looking to fund greater loyalty to their brand and their card. And we have retailers who take some of the earnings off the RSA and plough it right back into additional offers. So it varies across. I think the reality is right now everyone is \u2013 Brian mentioned it early, retailer sales have not been necessarily stellar. So our retailers and our partners are really looking to us to work with them to really make sure we are continuing to get right offers out there. But the retailers are high. The more engaged the retailer is, usually the better the program performance is.","Brian Doubles","It\u2019s not really a new phenomenon. You have to remember, we did low as 5% off a few years back. I think you are seeing more of this now, but it\u2019s a mix as well. It\u2019s maybe doing a little bit less one-off promotions, doing more on an everyday value prop. Again, this is where we are using our data analytics to really determine what is the best value proposition to get the consumer to come and to spend more. And so we are always looking at optimizing that mix between the one-off promotion and the everyday value prop.","David Ho","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","I just wanted to start with a quick follow-up on Amazon, are you any closer now to a harder rollout on that program?","Brian Doubles","Mark, we are in full rollout now. That really happened over holiday. The marketing around it is targeted marketing and Amazon controls a lot of that. But the program is performing very well in line with our expectations and we are pleased with the marketing and the advertising around it.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Are you seeing volumes accelerate as a result of that?","Brian Doubles","We continue to see good volumes on the Amazon program. Obviously, can\u2019t get real specific around it, but we are really excited when we launched it and it\u2019s performing in line with our expectations.","Mark DeVries","Okay, great. And I was hoping turning to the Walmart 3-2-1, I was hoping you could comment at least a high level on kind of your level of optimism that, that could really enhance your tender share there because this is a pretty substantial enhancement of the rewards prop relative to the old card, which is pretty modest. We have always \u2013 I am sorry go ahead.","Margaret Keane","No, I would say that\u2019s why we are pretty excited. We have been working with Walmart since 1999 and most of the value prop on the card has been kind of more pulsing promotional types of things like $0.05 or $0.10 off gas or something like that or some of the types of offerings. So to get a consistent value prop, that\u2019s \u2013 everyday use is really a big deal, because that\u2019s when the consistency and the usage of the card goes up. And obviously, Walmart is a big retailer, so we are pretty excited about it.","Mark DeVries","Yes, fair enough. So given the massive size of them, could you give us some sense of what even just a modest increase in tender share can mean to loan growth?","Brian Doubles","Well, it\u2019s hard for us to get specific around an individual program. Mark, you can take a look at what Walmart sales are in the U.S. and you can calculate your own percentage, but its Walmart continues to be a significant growth opportunity for us.","Mark DeVries","Okay, great. And then just one last question if I may, given you are only one quarter in, but we had 13% loan growth and guidance is for 7% to 9% receivable growth, does that just feel a little bit conservative here or even if you take away \u2013 you lap the comps on BP, Guitar Center, you are still probably 11% or so, you would have to see a pretty material slowing in growth through the end of the year just to get to the high end of the range and that\u2019s what the backdrop of like some really solid momentum around things like Amazon and Walmart just hoping you could comment on that?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter. We are really pleased with the overall growth. The only thing I would point out is the back half the comps get tougher. If the trends continue, we can be a little bit better. We re really pleased, when we look across the portfolio, all three platforms growing really well, all the underlying dynamics in line or better than what we expected. So we are really pleased with how we started the year. We are not going to update guidance. And I would just remind you that the comps get a little bit tougher. But as you pointed out, the start of the year has been really strong.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Thanks.","Greg Ketron","Vanessa, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Don Fandetti","Margaret, you guys have been in a pretty good position in terms of most of your deals being locked up until 2019, when should we start thinking about the risk of early renewals, because if we look at some of the deals that have traded recently, knowing that some of them have been more inter-banked, the ROAs are a lot lower. And so how would you handle that and could retailers come to you and say look, we would like to renew earlier, there is better pricing, could you comment on that?","Margaret Keane","Yes. So I think you have to put this in the context of kind of the overall portfolio and how we manage it. And we are always looking to extend relationships. We never let the relationship go to the end of the term before we start having dialogue. In most cases, something comes up like a new value prop launch that\u2019s very significant or they want to roll out a Dual Card or something like that. So I would just say that this is a constant part of how we manage the overall portfolio and we are always engaging with partners to ensure that we renew them before the end of the term. I think we will have to see how the competitive environment plays out. I think this is where we have to do a really good job delivering for our customers and really ensuring that we actually give them no recent RFP and try to engage with them as early as possible. And we have had great success with that over the long-term relationships that we have had.","Don Fandetti","Okay, great. That\u2019s all I have.","Margaret Keane","Okay. I just want to clarify one point. I mentioned the 29%. I just want to make sure people know. Its online sales were up 29% year-over-year. And if you compare that to what\u2019s happening overall in the industry, that\u2019s about 14% to 15%, so it\u2019s online sales. I don\u2019t want to confuse anyone there, because I might have got misinterpreted, so just want to clarify.","Greg Ketron","Yes. Thanks, everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations teams will be available to answer any further questions you may have and have a great day."],"20024":["Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) Q1 2018 Results Earnings Conference Call April 20, 2018  8:30 AM ET","Executives","Greg Ketron - Director, IR","Margaret Keane - President and CEO","Brian Doubles - EVP and CFO","Analysts","Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse","Ryan Nash - Goldman Sachs","Don Fandetti - Wells Fargo","Bill Carcache - Nomura","Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley","Chris Brendler - Buckingham Research","Sanjay Sakhrani - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.","Rick Shane - JPMorgan","Mark DeVries - Barclays Capital","John Hecht - Jefferies","Operator","Welcome to the Synchrony Financial First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call.

Good morning everyone and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us.","In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules, and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.","Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company's performance.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us. I'll begin on slide three. Overall, we started the year on a solid note with net earnings of $640 million or $0.83 per diluted share. Loan receivables grew within our expected range and we generated strong net interest income growth.","Purchase volume growth slowed in line with expectations given our underwriting refinements and average active account growth was driven by the attractive value propositions and promotional offers on our cards. The net interest margin and efficiency ratio performed as expected, as did our credit quality metrics. Brian will provide more detail on these ratios shortly.","Supporting our funding objective, we continue to generate strong deposit growth, which was up 10% during the quarter. This is an important area for us this year as we continue to implement our prefunding plan in preparation for onboarding the PayPal credit portfolio, which we expect to happen in the third quarter of 2018. The prefunding will consist of both deposit and wholesale funding.","Our capital position remains strong, and we continue to execute our capital plans paying a $0.15 dividend during the quarter and repurchasing 410 million of common stock. We also added some exciting new deals, renewed key relationships, and further expanded our CareCredit network.","In our retail card sales platform, we recently signed a new exclusive partnership with Crate and Barrel. The program is designed to expand customers' financing options and reward customer loyalty.","In addition to our private label credit card, we will be launching a Dual Card that can be used anywhere that MasterCard is accepted. We are excited about this new program and the innovative financing and rich rewards cardholders will have access to when we launch later this year.","We also added new partnerships with jtv, a leading retailer of jewelry and gemstones in United States; and with Mahindra, where we will provide the company's fast-growing U.S. dealer network with promotional financing options for new and used powersports vehicles and accessories. Both of these programs will be part of our Payment Solutions sales platform.","We also renewed several other partnerships, including Nationwide Marketing Group, Briggs & Stratton, and American Signature Furniture. And in CareCredit, we established a new strategic relationship with AVMA, the American Veterinary Medical Association.","In addition, we expanded our valuable CareCredit network into the growing day and medical spa market, helping spa providers drive growth by offering an additional payment option for consumers.","Through our partnership with American Med Spa Association and Spa Industry Association, providers can now make treatments and services more accessible, while expanding their reach to CareCredit's 11 million cardholders. And CareCredit cardholders will now enjoy expanded utility of their card in this in demand wellness segment.","An important objective is to extend the utility of our cards, which will move into the top of cardholders' wallets and migrate cardholders towards more repeat purchase behavior. We have made substantial progress in improving the utility, and therefore, the usage of our cards as evidenced by our reuse rates. For Payment Solutions, the reuse rate in the first quarter was 29% and for CareCredit, it was 53% of total purchase volume.","Equally important is ease of use of our cards and ensuring that cardholders have access to their cards, rewards, and account information across whatever channel they choose to utilize.","We have made investments to develop tools to ensure our cardholders can easily utilize their cards and access account information, including rewards, across our partners' digital channels.","SyPi, a mobile plug-in application, is an example of an investment we made to expand our mobile engagement capabilities and where we are receiving very positive response from our retail partners.","SyPi is currently being used in 19 of our retail partners' app, leading to a significant growth in usage by cardholders. We are also employing technologies such as Sydney, our Artificial Intelligent-Enhanced Virtual Assistant, which not only makes obtaining information easier for our cardholders, but also improves back-office efficiency.","Our digital sales penetration for our retail card consumers has been growing. Digital sales penetration was 28% in the first quarter. Over 40% of applications are happening online, with the mobile channel alone growing 37% over the same quarter of last year.","During the quarter, we also announced another strategic investment, this time, in Payfone, a leader in identity, authentication for digital channels. The investment is one of several we've recently made in the mobile and authentication space and obviously important area given our business model and the increasing move to digital sales channels.","We continue to seek these opportunities, which have proven to be very beneficial strategic decisions in the past with our investments in innovative companies, including Lupe, which evolved into Samsung Pay and GPShopper, a business we have since acquired which has delivered several cutting-edge technologies, including SyPi.","Given our interest in these innovative companies and seeing the value they can bring to our business and our partners, we have developed a team solely dedicated to the task of finding these opportunities and they will be continuing to seek innovative, value-added solutions that can augment our core business with the latest technology. These will not be large-scale investments. However, they will be important to the evolution of our business.","Another area I will highlight is our innovative approach and flexibility in navigating challenges with certain programs. Recently, the hhgregg bankruptcy provided an opportunity for us to accelerate the launch of another successful network card called Synchrony HOME. This card is accepted by retailers at nearly 18,000 locations in verticals such as home furnishings, flooring, and electronics.","Launching the network ensures continued card utility, helping us maintain a revenue stream and manage credit performance. So far, cardholder response has been positive, and we're encouraged by the early results.","In that same vein, we have decided to give Toys\"R\"Us cardholders the opportunity to convert their cards to a Synchrony MasterCard. To help make this card attractive, we have added a 2% cashback value proposition on all purchases.","These are examples of actions that we can take to preserve card utility and relationships with our existing cardholders, even when presented with challenges or issues with programs.","This was obviously a very productive quarter for us and we are pleased to continue to generate growth organically, while also launching new programs, extending the utility of our cards, and making strategic investments to improve the position of our business as we compete in an ever-evolving marketplace.","Before I turn the call over to Brian, I will give you a quick view on how each of our sales platforms performed during the quarter, which is on slide five of the presentation. In Retail Card, we grew loan receivables 5% over last year, reflecting broad-based growth across our partner programs. Interest and fees on loans increased 7%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth, both purchase volume and average active accounts grew 2%.","As I noted earlier, we had another active quarter in our Retail Card sales platform, with the win of a new partner, Crate and Barrel. We are very excited about this relationship and expanding the programs to offer their customers more financing options. We continue to leverage our strong Retail Card foundation and make investments to both drive organic growth and attract profitable new programs.","Payment Solutions delivered a strong first quarter. Broad-based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products resulted in loan receivables growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans also increased 9%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 7% and average active accounts increased 5%.","We are pleased to have added the two new partners in this platform, jtv and Mahindra, while also renewing several key programs. CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter, receivables growth of 8% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans also increased 8%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 8%, and average active accounts increased 7%. And we are excited to be expanding into new verticals, increasing utility of our card and helping business attract clients through expanded payment offerings.","We continue to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the first quarter. We are extending and deepening relationships, signing new programs, and providing innovative, value-added solutions for our partners and cardholders.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.","Brian Doubles","Thanks Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. This morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $640 million, which translates to $0.83 per diluted share. We continue to deliver good growth, with loan receivables up 6% and interest and fees on loans receivables up 8% over last year.","Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. Purchase volume grew 3% over last year. The slower growth in recent quarters reflects the underwriting refinements we have noted previously and the hhgregg bankruptcy. I will cover the impact of the underwriting refinements we've made in more detail later in the presentation.","As we move forward in the impact from these items are included in the prior year run rate, we would expect their impact to moderate in future quarters. Average active account growth was 2% over last year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances, with growth in average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year.","RSAs increased $36 million or 5%. While we shared the strong topline growth and positive operating leverage generated in the quarter, this was offset by higher incremental provision expense.","RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.7% for the quarter, the same level as last year and in line with our expectations. The provision for loan losses increased only 4% over last year, a significantly lower increase than we have been experiencing over the past two years.","And the reserve build in the quarter was $164 million, lower than the $200 million to $225 million range we had expected and substantially lower than the $332 million reserve build in the first quarter of last year. Both reflect the moderating trends in credit normalization and slightly lower loan receivables growth as well as the impact from our underwriting refinements. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation.","Other income was $18 million lower than the prior year. While interchange was up $13 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card this was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $18 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.","As we noted previously, we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend around 100% with some quarterly fluctuation. Other expenses increased $80 million or 9% versus last year, driven primarily by growth, marketing, and technology investments.","We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities and investments to automate and streamline our back office.","The efficiency ratio was 30.9% for the quarter compared to 30.3% last year and in line with our expectations. The slight increase was driven by timing of strategic investments as well as upfront build cost related to the onboarding of PayPal.","Lastly, we did continue our prefunding in the first quarter ahead of the expected closing of the PayPal credit portfolio in the third quarter this year. The increase in liquidity of 15% over last year as well as the increase in liquidity to assets ratio to over 19% versus 18% last year reflect the growth in prefunding through both deposits and wholesale funding. This impacted metrics in the first quarter such as the net interest margin which I will cover next on slide seven.","Net interest income was up 7%, driven by the loan receivables growth and net interest margin was 16.05% compared to last year's margin of 16.18%. The margin was largely in line with our expectations. The margin was impacted by a slightly lower mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, driven primarily by prefunding the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition.","An increase in total interest-bearing liabilities cost of 26 basis points to 2.1% also impacted the margin. Part of the increase in the rate reflects the prefunding strategy as well as higher benchmark rates. This was largely offset by an increase in the yield on receivables, up 18 basis points from last year, mainly due to the increase in prime rates, partially offset by growth in promotional balances.","Regarding our margin outlook for 2018, it is unchanged at 15.75% to 16% including the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition. For next quarter as we continue to build the prefunding ahead of the portfolio acquisition you could see the margin decline into the 15.25% to 15.5% range, virtually all driven by the impact of building liquidity ahead of the transaction.","This mainly impacts the denominator, earning assets, without much of an offset on net interest income. We expect the core margin to continue in the 16.25% range. And once the portfolio is onboard, the margin will return to those levels as the liquidity is replaced by the PayPal Credit portfolio.","Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.52% compared to 4.25% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.28% versus 2.06% last year.","The rate of increase in both the 30-plus and 90-plus delinquency rates slowed for the second quarter in a row, reflecting a more modest impact from normalization and the impact of our underwriting refinements.","Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 6.14% compared to 5.33% last year and in line with our expectations. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCOs continues to be normalization. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.37% and the reserve build from the fourth quarter was $164 million.","As I noted earlier, the reserve build was lower than the $200 million to $225 million range we expected due to the moderating impact from credit normalization and somewhat slower receivables growth as well as the impact from our underwriting refinements. We expect the reserve build next quarter to be similar to this quarter in the $175 million range.","As we look forward to the remainder of 2018, I'd like to describe the impact related to the underwriting refinements on our more recent vintages and our purchase volume growth. First, the most recent vintages continue to trend in line with our expectations. As you remember, we started to make refinements to our underwriting in the second half of 2016, and we continue to see the positive impact of those changes.","Additionally, we have continued to make incremental underwriting changes throughout the year and the vintage curve data suggests that the 2017 vintage is performing better than 2016 and more in line with our 2015 vintage.","Not surprisingly, these underwriting refinements have also resulted in changes to our purchase volume mix by FICO score. If you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification, we continue to grow at a fairly strong pace in accounts with a FICO score greater than 721, which increased 8% over the same quarter last year, while purchase volume for the below 660 FICO range actually declined 15%, reflecting the actions we have been taking. These trends help inform our view of loss expectations in 2018 and beyond.","In summary, while credit continues to normalize from here, we expect the pace of the change and the impact on our results to continue to moderate as we move through 2018, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk adjusted returns.","Moving to slide nine, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $988 million, up 9% over last year. Expenses continue to be primarily driven by growth, marketing, and technology investments.","As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio is 30.9% for the quarter versus 30.3% last year and in line with our expectations. The slight increase was driven by timing of strategic investments as well as upfront build costs related to the onboarding of PayPal. Our efficiency ratio outlook for the year remains around 31%.","Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital, and liquidity position as well as continued execution of the capital plan we announced last May. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business.","Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by nearly $5 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 73% of our funding, slightly higher than the 72% level we were operating at last year.","We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital capabilities. Longer term, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we're pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers.","As part of our prefunding plan for the PayPal Credit portfolio, we did issue $500 million of unsecured debt in the first quarter. We will continue to execute our prefunding plan as we prepare to onboard the PayPal portfolio in the third quarter of 2018. The prefunding will consist of both deposit and wholesale funding. So, overall, we continue to execute our funding strategy and feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.","Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 16.8% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, a 90 basis point reduction, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our capital plan and growth.","Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $24.6 billion, which equated to 25.7% of our total assets. This is up from 24.4% last year, partly reflecting the prefunding ahead of the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition, which we are holding in liquidity until the portfolio is onboard. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.","During the quarter, we continue to execute on the capital plan we announced last May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and repurchased 410 million of common stock during the first quarter. We have $210 million remaining in share repurchases of the $1.64 billion our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30th.","I'd also like to provide an update on our 2018 capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors in late March and we submitted the plan to our regulators in early April. This is in line with the timeline in previous years and we hope to be in a position to announce our capital plans later this quarter.","While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, we would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks in addition to supporting our growth and the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio during the third quarter.","Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Before I conclude, I wanted to recap our current view for the year. First, regarding our margin outlook for 2018, it is unchanged at 15.75% to 16%, including the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition.","For next quarter, as we continue to build the prefunding ahead of the portfolio acquisition, you could see the margin decline into the 15.25% to 15.5% range, largely driven by the impact of building liquidity ahead of the transaction. This mainly impacts the denominator, earning assets, without much of an offset on net interest income. We expect the core margin to continue in the 16.25% range and once the portfolio is onboard, the margin would return to those levels as the liquidity is replaced with the PayPal Credit portfolio.","We continue to expect NCOs to be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range for the full year of 2018, including the impact of PayPal. We expect credit normalization to continue to moderate. It is also important to remember that seasonality results in a higher net charge-off rate in the first half of the year compared to the second half, with the third quarter being the low point in the NCO rate.","Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds to continue to transition to be more growth-driven as we move through 2018. We believe the reserve build in the second quarter will be similar to this quarter in the $175 million range.","The onboarding of the PayPal Credit portfolio will result in much higher reserve builds in the second half of this year after the portfolio is on boarded due to the accounting requirements around portfolio acquisitions. We will provide more specifics around this after the portfolio is acquired, which we continue to expect will be in the third quarter.","Turning to expenses, we continue to generate positive operating leverage and continue to expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic and marketing investments to drive growth as well as the upfront build costs related to the onboarding of PayPal.","In summary, the business continues to generate good growth with attractive long-term returns. Assuming economic conditions and the health of the consumer are consistent going forward, our expectation is that core reserve builds will continue to moderate throughout the year, which combined with continued growth of the business and the impact from continued capital actions will help us generate EPS growth in 2018.","And while the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition creates a degree of EPS dilution this year, this will turn EPS accretive in 2019 and help provide a nice tailwind to EPS as we move forward.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap-up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. Guided by our strategic priorities, our results this quarter, including the many renewals and program wins, demonstrate our commitment to our partners and cardholders and the value they derive from our products and services.","We started the year with solid results, fully in line with our expectations and we'll continue to focus on generating momentum as the year proceeds, working every day to earn the business of our partners and attract new programs.","Returning capital to the shareholders remains a key priority and we are pleased to continue to return significant capital to shareholders through our dividend and share repurchase program.","We are also deploying capital through organic growth and program acquisitions. The previously announced acquisition of PayPal's U.S. Consumer Credit Receivables portfolio is an example of this, as are the strategic investments we are making in our business to help it grow.","At the end of the day, we remain focused on risk adjusted returns, on making strategic business decisions that help us grow our business and deliver value for our partners, cardholders, and shareholders.","I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up to Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]","And we have our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. And really helpful detail in terms of the credit steps that you're taking and its impact on the overall portfolio. When you think about what you've done and this -- your ability to generate kind of 8% growth, perhaps 720, I guess, is the reduction in the sub-660, is that something that's ongoing or are there are steps that you're taking to figure out how the put that back so it's not going to be as big a drag at some point?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure Moshe. So, what I would say is that what we're seeing right now in the purchase volume, both last quarter and this quarter is really the cumulative impact of the changes that we started to make back in the second half of 2016.","So, I think you're going to see a continued reduction in purchase volume on accounts below 660 FICO. I think it probably lasts maybe through the balance of this year and then I think as we get into 2019, just given that we will be comping against those periods where we have lower sales in that segment, I think the purchase volume will kind of moderate or impact on the purchase volume will moderate as we get into 2019 and you won't feel as much of an impact on the overall stats. Does that make sense?","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Yes, it does. And just on a related matter, maybe. Given that I think that the level of overall credit in the PayPal portfolio is slightly below yours, how does that inform your thoughts about how you can manage that portfolio from both existing credit and the group standpoint?","Brian Doubles","Yes, that's a great question. I mean, first, I'd say that we don't just look at the loss rate when we're evaluating one of our programs. We look at the overall return that we're earning on the program; we look at the resiliency of those earnings in various scenarios, including stress scenarios. And what I can tell you is that we're very comfortable with the risk profile of the PayPal Credit portfolio. I think it's well underwritten. We really like the risk adjusted returns.","With that said, while we don't see -- I don't see any significant underwriting changes that we're planning to make at this point. We're obviously going to work with PayPal very closely. I think one of the benefits is they've got a ton of data on their customers. We're going to marry that up with some of our tools and I think jointly, we'll be in a position to make really good underwriting decisions going forward. But I wouldn't expect to see any significant changes. Again, overall, we're very comfortable with the risk profile of that portfolio.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Thanks very much.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Brian Doubles","Hey Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Brian, in regard to the reserve build whether this quarter or into 2Q, can you maybe separate for us what was driven by growth, given the fact that the portfolio has -- the growth rate has have over the last year or so and versus what's driven by normalization?","And I take the point that you're going to be giving us specific guidance related to PayPal after the deal closes, however, can you just provide us with some view of how we should at least think about the build in the back half of the year, how much will come in the back half of the year versus maybe how much will come in 2019? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure, Ryan. So, if you think about the reserve build of $164 million, obviously, that came in below our expectations, which is good news. It was driven primarily by a combination of moderating impact from credit normalization. Receivables growth drove a small portion of that. It came in slightly below our expectations. But if you remember, we guided to 5% to 7% receivables growth, we came in at 6%.","So, I would say on the receivables growth that we're tracking pretty much in line with expectations. So, really, what you're seeing when you think about the reserve build is the impact from the underwriting refinements that we made. So, things are trending in the right direction, very much in line with our expectations.","So, as you think about the second quarter just based on the trends that we're seeing we think the reserve build next quarter will come in in a similar range something around $175 million. And again, significantly lower than the trends we were seeing in 2017.","So, that gets you through the first half of 2018 and then as you think about PayPal coming on. The thing that you've got to remember with PayPal is it comes on with no reserves. We're obviously going to book our standard 14 to 15 months of forward losses. Those reserves will get built over nine to 12 months and think about a fairly significant portion of that reserve build coming in the second half. So, you'll see more of that reserve build in the third quarter, in the fourth quarter, and then it starts to taper off as you get into the kind of the first half of 2019. Other than that--","Ryan Nash","Got it.","Brian Doubles","\u2026we've got to bring the book on. We'll give you a little more color next quarter when we have a really good sense at that point of what the portfolio looks like.","Ryan Nash","Got it. I appreciate the color. And then while I know it's still early just given your comments around the recent vintage performance and based on the trends that you've been seeing I guess are you guys still expecting credit in the core portfolio to begin to level off in the second half? And maybe early what do you think this could potentially mean for 2019 charge-offs on the legacy portfolio ex-PayPal?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Ryan I think it's a little early to start calling 2019 net charge-offs. What I can tell you is that the first quarter was very much in line with our expectations. We're not changing our view for the full year. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be in that 5.5% to 5.8% range for the full year.","Everything is pretty consistent with what we communicated back in January. When we look at the vintages they're performing in line with our expectations. The 2017 vintage looks better than 2016 and more in line with 2015. We're obviously as we talked about earlier remixing the portfolio a little bit, a little bit less than below 660, a little more and above 720.","And you're seeing that come through in both the reserve build and delinquencies which have moderated in the past two quarters. And I think those are probably the two best indicators that tell you things are on track.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thank you for taking my questions.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Thanks Ryan.","Operator","And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Brian good morning. Clearly credit seems to be improving on a year-over-year basis, but as you talk to investors, I think one of the big concerns right now is sort of renewals and how to think about and should that sort of cap the multiple and obviously can't comment on that. But can you give us some any sort of commentary around these big renewals that you have in 2019? Do you think you'd be closer to providing some kind of color as we go through 2018? Or will this just sort of hit us one day, and we'll get a press release?","Margaret Keane","So -- hi it's Margaret, how are you?","Don Fandetti","Hey Margaret.","Margaret Keane","So, what I would say is we're well-entrenched with in partners and working every day to do these renewals. Obviously, we know what's important to communicate as soon as we can. What I can tell you is we can't really tell you sooner than when we know.","But what I can tell you is the entire organization is focused on renewals. We work with our partners every single day to make sure we're meeting their needs and having the right conversations at the right levels to ensure we're working hard to get those renewals under our belt.","Don Fandetti","Okay. And Brian, a clarification on the delinquency. From a year-over-year basis, it improved in Q1. Do you see that -- do you see further improvement there? Or do we sort of have what we are going to see on a year-over-year delinquency change?","Brian Doubles","No, I think you're seeing a trend in line with our expectations. If you go back to the third quarter last year, the year-over-year increase was 54 basis points, it came down to 35 last quarter, it came down to 27 this quarter. So, that's trending in the right direction.","Look, I wouldn't read too much into any one quarter, but we would expect the delinquency trends to continue to moderate in advance of net charge-offs moderating. So, I think we're certainly trending in that direction.","Don Fandetti","Fair. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thanks. Good morning. I had a question on capital, in particular, as it relates to regulatory reform. I know that there's a lot unknown still, but just broadly speaking some non-GSIBs have indicated that the potential to return capital more freely without having to go through the annual process is really the biggest benefit that they see potentially driving, more so than any potential expense savings.","You guys are now at 16.8% for CET1. Can you help us frame the potential that you guys could do -- would be willing and\/or able to do kind of a stepped-up increase in your buyback to get that 16.8% down closer to peer levels versus the more gradual path that you guys have talked about historically, of course, all subject to regulatory reform?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. It's a great question. Obviously, there's a lot of moving pieces in all the proposals that are out there, even the more recent ones. I would say based on what we're seeing right now, I think the positives probably outweigh the negatives for us, particularly if they soften some of the requirements for banks below $250 billion in assets. So, I do think that should benefit us. So, there's definitely some reason, we think, to be optimistic, but we've really got to wait and see what gets past.","As you've highlighted, we are sitting on a significant amount of excess capital today. We have indicated that our goal is to bring our ratios more in line with the peer set. When we look at our business, the returns, the resiliency of the earnings profile and distressed environment, we compare very well to our peers, so we do feel like that as an achievable target over time. However, it's a little immature for us to really speculate on the pace or the magnitude of any future payouts.","The good news is that with the combination of good organic growth, PayPal is a great use of capital -- deploying capital at attractive returns, strong dividend, buyback. We've got a lot of options available to us to bring the capital ratio is more in line. But any more specific commentary is a little premature.","Bill Carcache","That's helpful. Thanks Brian. If I may on the same topic and follow-up with a question around liquidity. And perhaps could you talk a little bit about the amount of liquidity that you guys now hold, perhaps how that could change if you were able to run with the amount that you need, rather than the amount that, I guess, you're currently required to run out for regulatory purposes. And if regulatory reform were to allow you to maintain less liquidity, maybe just frame for us what that could mean for your NIM?","Brian Doubles","Yes, I would think about any impact there, Bill, being pretty modest. If you look at how we operated last year and take liquid assets as a percent of the total, that's probably the range to expect going forward.","Now, you're going to see that percentage tick up. You saw it in the first quarter. You're going to see an even greater increase in the second quarter for the prefunding for PayPal. But once that normalizes out and we bring that portfolio on, I would think about liquid assets as a percent of total being pretty much in line with how we ran in 2017.","Bill Carcache","Got it. Thank you very much for taking my questions.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hey, good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Two more PayPal questions. One just to make sure I understood. I heard you say that look post-PayPal; you wouldn't expect to run these differently on a credit perspective. So, I just want to make sure I understand, does that mean that you're taking in PayPal a little bit lower risk that stays that way?","Your portfolio stays your way and the blended average is a little bit lower than where it is today? Or do you expect interested over time, you would be moving the PayPal portfolio towards your current risk characteristics?","Brian Doubles","Yes, I think that's the way to think about it. We're very comfortable with the loss rate and the overall return profile is very attractive on PayPal. And if you remember, we don't underwrite all of our programs the same way. We have a very customized approach. So, we operate the programs today with different loss rates and that depends on a lot of factors. It depends on the margin on those programs, the overall return profile, the resiliency of those earnings.","And when we look at PayPal, we're very comfortable with the overall profile. So, the way I would think about that in terms of the total company is we've indicated we don't expect it to have an impact on the net charge-off rate this year. I do think it'll provide a little upward bias in loss rate as we move into 2019, but it should be pretty modest. And overall when we look at the entire company inclusive of PayPal, we're very comfortable with the risk profile.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. And then on RSAs, how does the PayPal portfolio impact the RSAs, either in percentage terms or seasonalities, is there any change to that we should be anticipating?","Brian Doubles","Yes. So, if you go back to our outlook, we provided a ratio for RSAs at 4.2% to 4.4%, excluding PayPal and unchanged including PayPal that 4.2%, 4.4%. So, it's not significant enough to move that ratio at all for us for the total company.","Betsy Graseck","Right. And even when you flip into a full year impact, like 1Q, 2Q, there's no\u2026","Brian Doubles","Yes, I wouldn't expect it to have a meaningful change to the RSA rate for the total company.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And no impact on the seasonality?","Brian Doubles","No, it shouldn't have much of an impact on seasonality. In terms of seasonality, you do have to factor in the third quarter, we hit a high point in the RSA, but we don't see anything with PayPal that would necessarily change that dynamic. That's really more of a seasonality-driven event, where you've got higher margins, lower charge-offs in the third quarter, that drives increase sharing with the partners.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. All right. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham Research.","Chris Brendler","Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Could you discuss potentially the investments you're making in marketing and whether or not we'll see some of the drag from underwriting start to turn as you head towards the latter part of the year?","And particularly, looking at the growth rates in CareCredit where I think you face in pretty competitive set, it feels like the slowdown there may just be underwriting related, but any color on that growth outlook will be very helpful? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Let me -- I'll start on the marketing expenses. I think the increase just in the quarter was largely driven by an increase in marketing on our deposits related to the prefunding for PayPal. We also had some timing in our strategic investments as well as we made some specific growth investments related to some of our Retail Card programs.","Obviously, some of those are here with the partners, which is why you saw the RSA come down slightly year-over-year. What was your second question?","Margaret Keane","CareCredit. I think on CareCredit, I think we've mentioned this in the past; it's really a great business. And we've really focused our resources on the sell side to increase utility, the card which we're definitely seeing in the core business and then actually, we've expanded verticals that we're going after.","So, we're taking the model we built and dentist and vet and taking it to other verticals, which is working out to be a very positive thing as well as the fact that we expanded utility of the card in places like Rite-Aid. So, all of that has come together to allow us to continue to really grow in that particular platform.","Chris Brendler","And then just take the slight yield degradation in that CareCredit business to be sort of an indicator of a mix shift of market or is there are other factors going on?","Brian Doubles","It's really driven by some merchant or provider mix where we earn a slightly lower merchant discounts from larger providers and so there's a little bit of mix impact year-over-year. But generally, I'd say that core -- the core yield, the core margins are very stable in CareCredit.","Chris Brendler","Excellent. Thanks so much.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. Just one clarification on the credit stats. I was wondering if you're seeing any behavior among your delinquent borrowers as it relates to tax reform. As these consumers have gotten more discretionary income, have you seen some increase in like payments of delinquent loans?","Brian Doubles","Yes. We really haven't seen anything yet, Sanjay. Obviously, we remain optimistic that we may see something this year. As you know, we didn't build anything into our forecast for that. But if we do expect it customers have additional discretionary dollars that they're either going to spend those dollars or maybe delever a bit as we saw with lower gas prices, but it's still very early.","So, we just haven't seen anything that we would directly attribute to the tax savings. I think when we look at the trends, when we look at our delinquencies, we would tie it more to the underwriting changes that we made than we would to anything specific on consumer or tax saving.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. And then a follow-up on the RSAs, I was hoping, Brian, maybe you could help me with this, because when you look at RSAs to receivables, that was lower than our expectations. And when you look at that metric year-over-year, the ROA went higher, but the RSA as a percent of receivables didn't. So, how should we think about the RSA levels as it relates to profitability? Or how should we think about modeling it? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, Sanjay. We know that this is one of the more challenging aspects of our business for you all to model, which is why we gave you a pretty clear guidance on what to expect. What I can tell you is the first quarter; it came in line with our expectations. I think it's probably helpful if you go back to 2017 where we ended the year at 3.9% of average receivables. If you remember, that was well below our original view of 4.4% to 4.5% for the year and that reduction was driven primarily by the partner sharing in the higher reserve build.","So, just with that as a backdrop, as you think about 2018, we think we moved back into that 4.2% to 4.4% range, largely driven by our expectations that the reserve builds are going to continue to moderate as we move throughout the year and you've seen some of that happen in the first quarter. So, as those reserve builds start to moderate, the RSAs move back closer to that historical range that you would have seen in 2015 and 2016. So, I think that's the best way to think about it.","If I had to highlight one other thing, I would highlight seasonality. Just to reiterate, the RSAs always had a high point in the third quarter when we see higher margins or net charge-offs, so you need to take that into account. But so far, we're tracking very much in line with our expectations and we think we end up somewhere in that 4.2% to 4.4% range for the year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Just one clarification, usually from first quarter to second quarter, it's reasonably the same, maybe slightly higher. I mean should we assume that's the case versus the second quarter then?","Brian Doubles","Look, I think the history is not a perfect predictor here. I think first quarter, we ended on the RSAs where we did to some degree, because net charge-offs were higher. So, it's going to depend and you should see that moderate a bit in terms of the net charge-off rate getting into the second quarter and hit a low point in the third. So, it might tick-up a bit in the second. It'll absolutely be elevated in the third quarter. I think that's the one thing that you can trust and then come back down in the fourth.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Thanks guys for taking my question this morning.","Brian Doubles","Sure.","Rick Shane","Margaret, you outlined some strategies in terms of loss mitigation around retailers going through bankruptcy. I'd love to hear your sort of comparison of what you would expect to related to a retailer going through liquidation in terms of charge-off profile versus what you are able to achieve through the mitigation strategy, sort of a champion\/challenger analysis.","Margaret Keane","Yes. So, first, what I would say is that most of our experience through liquidation is we usually liquidate these books profitably. I think we had an opportunity as we continue to expand our capabilities to think a little differently with the hhgregg portfolio by creating this home vertical, which has been really a real win for us in terms of those cards getting utilized as well as what we're doing on Toys\"R\"Us.","Obviously, one of the things we do when a company is going through liquidation is we immediately send our communications to the consumer set. That there debt is still due to us and for the most part, we see customers pay their debt off. Obviously, you might see a little uptick, but it quickly comes down as we start communicating with those customers.","I think in this case, the fact that we're providing utility both in the hhgregg case and the Toys\"R\"Us case with a fairly good value proposition, we're expecting a really good performance. I don't know Brian if you had anything.","Brian Doubles","Yes. I think one other thing Rick is really important here is maintaining some utility on the card, whether it's through a new program like we do at hhgregg or moving a portion of those customers to I think any brand of MasterCard as we intend to do with the Toys\"R\"Us portfolio.","I think if you can offer them a good product with an attractive credit line value prop, then they'll continue to use the card. And your prospects of minimizing the increasing net charge-offs are significantly greater. So, we feel pretty good about our strategies in both cases.","Rick Shane","Got it. And look I understand the utility case. If we were to index the expected charge-offs on a pool of loans to 100 and you were to go through -- you were to look at a retail that was going through bankruptcy or through liquidation where do you think that index would go versus expectations? Would it go to 150? And what do you think the mitigation strategy can dampen that too? Is obviously not going to be the baseline does it put you in the middle? How should we think about this?","Brian Doubles","Yes. I mean it wouldn't go to 150, Rick. Typically what you see is when there's an announcement on the retailer, you see a tick-up in delinquencies and net charge-offs very manageable. We look for a little bit of reserves for that and then it evens out over time.","I mean the thing that is important to remember here is that consumers particularly today are very aware of their credit score. Having come to the financial crisis, I would say consumers are more acutely aware of their credit score and the implications of doing on their credit scores than they've ever been.","And I think consumers know their obligated on the debt. We are very proactive in terms of our communication with customers to make sure they know that they're still obligated where to make a payment, how things work. And we generally see, like I said, a modest tick-up initially out of the gate and then that levels off and as Margaret said, we liquidate very profitably in all cases.","Rick Shane","Got it. Thank you guys for taking my questions.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","A question around kind of the underlying loan growth trends. Are you still at this point making underwriting tweaks that's contributing to the moderating growth? And should we expect once that's done and you've kind of anniversaried the end of that seeing maybe loan growth reaccelerate?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure Mark. So, look I would say receivables growth at 6% was right in line with our expectations and very much in line with what we communicated back in January. And when you look at the full year and you think about our growth, it's always been a combination of organic growth as well as portfolio acquisitions. And so it'll be 13% to 15% receivables growth this year which is very strong.","The question you raised is a good one. We are -- from our perspective, the underwriting refinements the impact to those will moderate as we move into 2019. That's our expectation. With that said you're never really done. We're always taking on new information. We're looking at payment behavior trends. And so we're constantly making modest refinements. What you're seeing in the results this quarter and you saw last quarter is really the cumulative effect of the changes that we started to make back in the second half of 2016.","To your point, as you start to lap some of those quarters, the comps will get a little bit easier. We'll probably move maybe closer to the historical growth rate for the business. But overall, we feel very good when we look at the underlying growth. We look at the changes that we made that are clearly having the desired impact, still seeing really good growth in that 720-plus FICO segment. And so this is intentional. It was deliberate and is having the desired results. And I think it starts to even out or should even out as we get into 2019.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. And then are there any receivables coming over with Crate and Barrel? So, can you give us a sense of when and how meaningful that might be?","Brian Doubles","Yes. We will acquire a small portfolio, but it won't have a material impact on our results.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Greg Ketron","Hey, Vanessa, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Good morning guys. Thanks much for fitting in here.","Brian Doubles","Hey John.","John Hecht","I guess you addressed the renewals earlier, but I'm wondering whether it's Crate and Barrel or -- which is your recent victory or any other renewals, is there anything you could tell us about changes with respect to partnered prioritizations or the overall economics of the recent renewals and new partnerships that suggest there has been any change in how the overall structures work or is it been pretty consistent with where we were a couple of years ago?","Margaret Keane","It's pretty consistent. I think what we always do -- as Brian even mentioned earlier, is we always look at the returns and the sense of the overall portfolio. So, -- and we look at the risk\/reward in each of those relationships, how much risk are we taking versus the retailers are taking on.","So, we look at the blended returns to make sure that we're making that good risk\/reward trade-off as we bring whether renewals back on or new deals. So, I'd say the environment, while continues to be competitive, I think is pretty rational. So, we're feeling good about what we're winning and the portfolios that we're bringing on and the renewals that we're doing.","John Hecht","Okay. Thanks. And second question is just wondering whether it's commentary on Amazon or just the overall online, e-commerce trends. Is there anything update you can give us there with respect to penetration rates and so forth?","Margaret Keane","Yes. So, -- on Retail Card, our overall penetration rate was 28% for this quarter, which was up about 1.6% from first quarter 2017. Now, the national average is about 15%, so we feel like the continued investments that we're making in our digital capabilities are really ensuring that we're staying ahead of the competitive framework.","I think online and kind of that whole frictionless payment experience is something that we're extraordinarily focused on, the investments we made in Payfone which is going to help us more quickly authenticate customers as they apply for credit through their mobile application, I think, is going to be and in the real positive for us. So, we continue to see mobile and online as a critical element of what we're trying to build out and ensure we're best-in-class for our partners.","Our partnership with Amazon is a great partnership and one that continues to grow, so we feel really good about where we're positioned there as well. So, overall, we're feeling good where we are on the online space and mobile space and our capabilities that we're building out.","John Hecht","Great. Appreciate the color. Thanks.","Greg Ketron","Yes. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest for Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day.","Operator","And thank you ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."],"20027":["Synchrony Financial (NYSE:SYF) Q1 2019 Earnings Conference Call April 18, 2019  8:30 AM ET","Company Participants","Greg Ketron - Director of Investor Relations","Margaret Keane - President & Chief Executive Officer","Brian Doubles - Executive Vice President & Chief Financial Officer","Conference Call Participants","Sanjay Sakhrani - KBW","Terry Ma - Barclays","Rick Shane - JPMorgan","Chris Brendler - Buckingham","Matthew O'Neill - Autonomous Research","Dominick Gabriele - Oppenheimer","David Scharf - JMP Securities","John Hecht - Jefferies","Operator","Welcome to the Synchrony Financial First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call.

Margaret Keane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Doubles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin on slide 3. The momentum we generated over the last several quarters continued in the first quarter of 2019. We maintained our strong performance across several key areas of the business, which helped drive earnings of $1.1 billion, or $1.56 per share. Included in our results is the reserve release related to the Walmart portfolio being moved to loans held-for-sale, which positively impacted results by $0.56. Brian will discuss this in more detail later in the call.","Loan receivables grew 3%. On a core basis, which excludes the Walmart portfolio, loan receivables grew 17%. We generated solid net interest income and purchase volume growth of 10% and average active accounts were up 8%. We also recently renewed and extended key relationships and added some exciting new partnerships.","In our Payment Solutions sales platform, we recently extended our exclusive consumer financing program with P.C. Richard & Son, a leading family-owned and operated appliance and electronics company. P.C. Richard & Son is a valued partner and this extension will build on our long-term partnership in which we have provided credit card and promotional financing options for their customers. The partnership will continue to leverage our marketing analytics and mobile technologies to further enhance the customer experience.","We are partnering on marketing and loyalty programs and a branded mobile app for purchasing and payments, in which customers can shop, receive special offers and promotions and service their credit card. We are excited to continue to build on this long and successful partnership.","We also announced a multi-year extension with Rheem to continue providing a financing program for the purchase of HVAC and water heating products and services. Rheem offers a wide range of residential and commercial products including air conditioners, furnaces, water heaters and more. We have been providing financing options for Rheem customers for 15 years and look forward to continuing to deliver value to Rheem and their customers.","Additionally, in our Payment Solutions platform, we recently signed a multi-year extension of our Suzuki installment powersports and marine program. Qualifying buyers will continue to have access to special financing options and exclusive offers for Suzuki products through its dealer network in the United States.","Powersports is an important category for us and Suzuki is one of our longest running programs in this category, so we are pleased to announce this extension. One of our strategic priorities is to grow our network to create broader acceptance and utility for our cards.","To that end, we recently announced that we expanded acceptance categories for our Synchrony Car Care network to cover even more auto-related needs. Cardholders now have the ability to use this comprehensive Car Care solution at more than 500,000 locations across 25 categories, including gas, auto parts and service, car washes, parking, ridesharing and more. The card also now offers six-month promotional financing on purchases greater than $199. Synchrony Car Care is a valuable financial resource for consumers that want to manage their auto spending needs with one convenient payment method.","In addition, our Synchrony HOME credit card is now accepted at over one million locations nationwide. The card offers valuable rewards including 2% cash back on purchases under $299. And for purchases up $299 or more, cardholders can now receive six months promotional financing. This is in addition to 12 months to 60 months of promotional financing on qualifying purchases at thousands of participating locations. We are pleased to expand the value propositions on this card, giving cardholders the flexibility they want for larger ticket home purchases.","We are also expanding our CareCredit network via a new partnership with Simplee. Through this new partnership, CareCredit will now be part of the Simplee financial experience platform, a digital self-service experience that incorporates advanced data analytics and machine learning to provide patients personalized estimates and payment options. We are happy to be part of the innovative Simplee network.","Another strategic priority for us is to expand and diversify our business. An example of this is extending product offerings through the entry into adjacent and complementary businesses. Our recent acquisition of Pets Best represents our entry into the pet insurance business as a managing general agent.","This acquisition will allow us to offer a comprehensive suite of payment options for veterinarians and pet owners to help families get the care they need for their pet. This complementary acquisition builds on our decades of expertise in the veterinary market. We are excited about adding the Pets Best products to our offerings. This is a type of acquisition we seek, one that makes sense for our customers and partners and enables us to expand our network and product offerings.","As you know adding utility ultimately translates to increased usage and we have made considerable progress on that front. For example, for CareCredit, the reuse rate in the first quarter was 54%.","Equally important as utilization is ease of use of our cards. Concurrent with the rise of e-commerce and digital shopping experiences, we have been making investments to ensure our cardholders have access to their cards rewards and account information across whatever channel they choose to use.","The digital sales penetration for our Retail Card consumers has been growing. Digital sales penetration was 37% in the first quarter. Overall, 48% of our application are happening online, with the mobile channel alone growing 37% over the same quarter of last year.","Overall, this was a strong quarter for us. We continue to generate organic growth, renewing partner relationships, develop valuable strategic partnerships and invest in innovative digital technology and seamless customer experiences. These areas of focus are helping to drive our performance and remain critical for our future success.","I'll spend a few moments on our sales platform results on slide five and then turn it over to Brian to detail our financial results for the quarter.","In Retail Card, strong results were driven by our PayPal Credit program acquisition, which was largely offset by the reclassification of the Walmart portfolio. Loans were up 1%, but excluding the Walmart portfolio, they were up 22%. Interest and fees on loans increased 15% over last year and purchase volume grew 11%. Average active accounts were up 10%. ","Payment Solutions also delivered another solid quarter. We generated broad-based growth across the sales platform, with particular strength in home furnishings and luxury products that resulted in loan receivable growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased 7%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 4% and average active accounts increased 3%.","CareCredit also continued to generate solid growth. Receivables growth of 7% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans also increased 6%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 8% and average active accounts increased 4%.","We continued to deliver solid growth across all three of our sales platforms, as we continue to extend relationships, increase card utility and provide value add solutions to our partners and cardholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. This morning we reported first quarter earnings of $1.1 billion or $1.56 per diluted share. This included the reserve release related to the Walmart portfolio being moved to loans held-for-sale during the quarter. The release totaled $522 million or $395 million after tax and provide an EPS benefit of $0.56 to the quarter.","We generated strong year-over-year growth in a number of areas. Excluding the Walmart portfolio, loan receivables were up 17%. Interest and fees on loan receivables were up 12% over last year, reflecting the addition of the PayPal Credit program last year. We also continued to deliver solid organic growth. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business, as well as the risk-adjusted returns on this growth.","Purchase volume growth was 10% and average active accounts increased 8% over last year. The positive trends continued in average balances, with growth in average balance per average active account up 5% compared to last year. RSAs increased $234 million or 33% from last year. Lower core reserve build growth, as well as improved program performance drove the increase.","RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.3% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. We continue to expect RSAs as a percentage of average receivables to be in the 4.0% to 4.2% range for 2019, which I will cover in more detail later.","The provision for loan losses decreased $503 million or 37% from last year, mainly driven by the reserve release related to the Walmart portfolio. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation.","Other expenses increased $55 million or 6% versus last year, driven primarily by expenses related to the addition of the PayPal Credit program and business growth. The growth rate did slow compared to prior quarters, and we have begun to execute certain cost actions ahead of the Walmart program conveyance later this year. The expense growth rate will continue to be impacted by the addition of the PayPal Credit program, until we are comparing against quarters with PayPal in the run rate, beginning with the third quarter of this year.","We will also continue to make strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities, and investments to automate and streamline the back office. So overall the company continued to generate strong results in the first quarter.","I'll move to slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 10% driven primarily by the addition of the PayPal Credit program and loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.08% compared to last year's margin of 16.05%. The margin was mainly in line with our expectations. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we deployed excess liquidity to support the PayPal Credit program acquisition and receivables growth.","Also impacting the margin was a decline in loan receivables yield and an increase in interest-bearing liability costs. The loan receivables yield was 21.14%, a decline of 25 basis points versus last year, mainly due to the impact of adding the PayPal Credit program. The increase in total interest-bearing liabilities cost was 54 basis points to 2.64% reflecting the higher benchmark rates.","So overall, the margin was in line with our expectations. We believe our margin will continue to run in the 15.75% to 16% range for the year with normal seasonality including a slight decline in the second quarter as well as some potential fluctuation around the Walmart portfolio sale later this year.","Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide 8. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30-plus delinquency rate was 4.92% compared to 4.52% last year, and the 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.51% versus 2.28% last year. The increase in the delinquency rates was primarily due to the reclassification of approximately $8 billion in Walmart loan receivables to held for sale. Only the Walmart loan receivables that we expect to charge-off prior to the expected portfolio of sale remain in period-end loan receivables, which is nearly $700 million.","Given that we continue to report the delinquencies on the nearly $700 million in period-end loan receivables and a high percentage of these receivables are delinquent and represent the majority of the delinquent accounts in the Walmart portfolio in total. The exclusion of the $8 billion in held for sale from period-end loan receivables skewed the reported rates higher.","Also impacting the delinquency rates is the addition of the PayPal Credit program. If you exclude the impact of the Walmart portfolio and the PayPal Credit program the 30-plus delinquency rate improved by approximately 10 basis points and the 90-plus delinquency rate improved by approximately five basis points, reflecting the impact of our underwriting refinements that have resulted in stable to improving credit trends.","Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 6.06% compared to 6.14% last year. While credit trends continued to improve, this was partially offset by the impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit program. Excluding the PayPal Credit program and the Walmart portfolio impact the net charge-off rate was down by approximately 30 basis points compared to last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.39% and the core reserve build from the fourth quarter excluding the reserve release related to the Walmart portfolio was $37 million.","As I noted earlier, the core reserve build was lower than our expectations, due to the improving credit trends resulting from the underwriting refinements we made. Looking forward, we expect the core reserve build for the second quarter will be largely driven by growth and will be in the $100 million to $150 million range. We still expect the additional reductions in reserves related to the Walmart portfolio will average in the $200 million to $250 million range in the second and third quarters. We still anticipate the sale to occur in the late third or early fourth quarter of this year.","We also expect net charge-offs to be 20 to 30 basis points higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter due to the timing of recoveries and as we begin to see the full impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit program. The recovery rate as a percentage of average receivables was 1.27% in the first quarter and we have been running closer to 1% in prior quarters.","Regarding the PayPal Credit program, we are now largely through most of the credit-related purchase accounting benefit that resulted from acquiring the portfolio last year. This is in line with our expectations and included in our 2019 net charge-off outlook. We continue to expect net charge-offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with the slight increase year-over-year entirely driven by the impact from the PayPal Credit portfolio, partially offset by the sale of the Walmart portfolio later this year. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart the net charge-off rate is expected to be flat to 2018.","In summary, credit trends have leveled-off and are showing improvement in line with our expectations and we expect the trends to continue to show stability as we move forward assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns.","Moving to slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $1 billion, up 6% over last year, and were primarily driven by the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program and growth.","As I noted earlier, the growth rate did slow compared to prior periods, and we have begun to execute on certain cost actions ahead of the Walmart program conveyance later this year and we will continue to execute on this as the year progresses. The efficiency ratio was 31% for the quarter, the same level as last year and in line with our expectations.","Moving to slide 10. The key highlights are, we have maintained our funding mix and strong capital and liquidity levels while deploying capital through growth and on-boarding the PayPal Credit program.","We also made progress this year on deploying capital through the execution of the capital plan we announced last May, which increased our dividends and the size of our share repurchases. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity profile.","Over the last year, we've grown our deposits $7.5 billion or 13%, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 75% of our funding compared to 73% last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capabilities. Longer term, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers.","In March, we issued $1.25 billion in senior unsecured notes, with $600 million having a five-year maturity and $650 million having a 10-year maturity. The issuances had strong demand and were significantly oversubscribed.","Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 14.5% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.8% on a fully phased-in basis last year, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio growth and continued execution of our capital plan.","During the quarter, we continued to execute on the capital plan we announced last May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.21 per share and repurchased 966 million of common stock during the first quarter. This represented 30.9 million shares repurchased during the quarter and completes the 2.2 billion share repurchase program our board approved last May.","Regarding our 2019 capital plan. Our plan was reviewed and approved by our Board of Directors and we submitted the plan to our regulators in late March. This is similar to the timeline in previous years. While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, it does include capital deployment from the anticipated capital freed up from the reserve releases and sale of the Walmart portfolio, as well as our regular ongoing capital plan that would include continued deployment of capital through both dividends and share buybacks, in addition to supporting our growth.","Total liquidity, including undrawn credit facilities, was $23.4 billion, which equated to 22.2% of our total assets. This is down from nearly 26% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity to support the PayPal credit program acquisition.","Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Before I conclude I wanted to recap our current view for the second quarter and the year. Overall, the margin performed in line with our expectations for the first quarter. We believe our margin will continue to run in the 15.75% to 16% range for the year with the normal seasonality, including a slight decline in the second quarter, as well as some potential fluctuation around the Walmart portfolio sale later this year.","RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.3% for the quarter, in line with our expectations. Lower core reserve build growth, as well as improved program performance were drivers in the quarter. As we expect the reserve builds to align more with growth in future quarters, this will have a moderating impact on the RSA percentage. We continue to expect the RSA percentage to be in the 4% to 4.2% range for 2019.","Regarding credit. We expect the core reserve build for the second quarter will be largely driven by growth and will be in the $100 million to $150 million range. We still expect the additional reductions in reserves related to the Walmart portfolio will average in the $200 million to $250 million range in the second and third quarters. We still anticipate the sale to occur in the late third or early fourth quarter of this year.","We also expect net charge-offs to be 20 to 30 basis points higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter, due to the timing of recoveries and as we began to see the full impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit program. This is in line with our expectations and included in our 2019 net charge-off outlook.","We continue to expect net charge-offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with a slight increase compared to 2018, entirely driven by the impact from the PayPal Credit portfolio, partially offset by the sale of the Walmart portfolio later this year. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart, the NCO rate is expected to be flat to 2018.","Turning to expenses. We continue to generate positive operating leverage and still expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year. In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive long-term returns.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap-up and then will open the call for Q&A. We generated strong results this quarter as our focus on organic growth, program renewals, strategic partnerships, forward-thinking technology investments and actionable data analytics continue to be key factors in our success.","We are pleased with the significant number of renewals and extensions we have generated over the last several quarters. We are making investments that create value for our partners and a better more seamless experience for our cardholders.","And we're maintaining our focus on delivering value for our shareholders. To that end, we returned $1.1 billion in capital through 966 million of share repurchases and a $0.21 per share quarterly dividend. Additionally, we remain focused on deploying capital through continued organic growth and program acquisitions.","I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. [Operator Instructions] Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Q \u2013 Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. I was hoping to just drill down on the RSA trend a little bit, which is a little bit higher than our expectations. And obviously Brian, you guys kept the guidance range unchanged. I was just hoping you could give us a sense of the sequencing of that RSA because it's been a little uneven in the past. And just to be clear, the reserve release for Walmart doesn't flow through the RSA, right? And then secondly, just on the disclosure change between oil and gas to the Payment Solutions segment, could you just talk about what drove that? Thanks.","A \u2013 Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure Sanjay. So let me take your middle question first and just confirm what you said that the Walmart reserve release did not run through the RSA. So that was not a driver in terms of the quarter and what we recorded. The largest driver of that year-over-year increase in the RSA was really the lower core reserve build. We also saw a better overall performance in many of our programs, so that also pushed the rate up compared to the prior year. So program mix was a driver.","And then, as you think about the balance of the year, now that our expectation is that core reserve build goes back into what we would consider a normal growth-driven reserve build in that $100 million to $150 million range, so that will bring that RSA percentage back down. We still expect the RSA to hit a seasonal high point in the third quarter, so no real change to that expectation. And then when you look at the balance of the year, we still expect it to be in the 4.0% to 4.2% range, so no change to what we communicated back in January.","And then just on the movement on the oil and gas portfolios from retail credit to Payment Solutions. So really the idea there was now that the auto network, we're seeing really good growth there. Those cards can be used for gas now, but there is some real synergies in putting those programs together just strategically. And so that was really the rationale for the move. It did depress the purchase volume numbers in Payment Solutions a little bit year-over-year, so we reported 4% growth in purchase volume in Payment Solutions. If you adjust that for oil and gas purchase, volume would have been up 8%, so very much in line with receivables.","Q \u2013 Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks.","Operator","And thank you. We have our next question from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Q \u2013 Terry Ma","Hey good morning, this is Terry Ma in for Mark. I just wanted to get some color on how the PayPal growth has been trending. You mentioned receivables growth has been up 28% ex Walmart so just hoping you could disaggregate this so we could get a sense of how growth would trend toward the back half of the year?","A \u2013 Margaret Keane","Yes. So I would say that the PayPal program is performing as we had expected it to perform. We said we've had great partnership with them. We are very integrated. We're really working on growing the program. But we had growth across some of our portfolios not just PayPal. So I'd say the core of the business is actually performing really well. I don't know Brian if you'd add anything to that.","A \u2013 Brian Doubles","The only thing I would add is you're seeing outsized growth in the first half year related to PayPal just because we didn't have it the first half last year. That will be comping against similar periods with PayPal in the second half of the year and that's why we expect the growth rate to come down into that 5% to 7% range. But as Margaret said, we're still seeing really good growth on PayPal.","Q \u2013 Terry Ma","Okay got it. Thanks. And just as a follow-up. How much OpEx takeout can we expect related to Walmart over the next few quarters?","A \u2013 Brian Doubles","Yes I would say we're on track with what we communicated back when we made the announcement on Walmart. So we got very detailed plans. We're executing those across the business. If you just look at expenses more broadly, they were up 6% compared to the prior year. But that was really entirely driven by the PayPal Credit portfolio and the fact that we brought that on.","If you exclude PayPal the program -- and exclude PayPal, the expenses were flat year-over-year. So that really is reflective of the fact that we're able to do some restructuring on certain areas of the business ahead of the Walmart portfolio sale later this year. So I think we feel pretty good about the cost takeout. The majority of the costs related to Walmart will come out after the portfolio moves later this year. Obviously, we're very focused on continuing to support that program. We're focused on ensuring a smooth transition. So the majority of those costs stay in place until the portfolio moves. So you really see the full benefit of the cost takeout in 2020.","Q \u2013 Terry Ma","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","And we have our next question from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Q \u2013 Rick Shane","Hey guys, thanks for taking my questions this morning. I just wanted to dive in a little bit deeper on the PayPal portfolio versus the existing portfolio. Is there anything different that we should be thinking about behaviorally in terms of seasonality spending pay downs as we move through the year? And is there any different mix between fixed and floating rate loans versus the existing portfolio we should consider in terms of asset sensitivity?","Brian Doubles","Yeah, Rick I wouldn't build anything in specific to PayPal. I mean we've -- just go through account what we have said in the past on PayPal. Obviously it runs at a slightly higher delinquency net charge-off profile. We did build in some APR increases to address that. And net-net you get back to a very similar return to that program relative to the rest of the portfolio. Seasonality and things like that look pretty similar. So there's nothing I would highlight specific to PayPal you should think about differently.","Rick Shane","Great. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you guys.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Rick.","Operator","And our next question comes from Chris Brendler with Buckingham.","Chris Brendler","Hi, thanks. Good morning and thanks for taking my question. I had a question on PayPal as well. Can you give us a sense; I really appreciate the additional disclosure on the impact of Walmart and PayPal on your credit metrics. But just qualitatively or maybe even more quantitatively, how's the PayPal portfolio performed since you acquired it in July?","And then are you also trying to say that PayPal is still servicing those loans? So do you expect that servicing to transfer near term? And would that have a beneficial impact on the credit metrics in that portfolio once you transfer to your own servicing platform? Thanks.","Margaret Keane","Yeah. So, first I'd say it's performing exactly like we thought it would perform and so both in terms of growth, in terms of delinquency, in terms of overall performance. So again we feel pretty happy about how the overall portfolio is performing. They are servicing the accounts now until we convert to our system, which will happen in June. And once that conversion happens it will be on our system.","I don't anticipate a big shift in the performance of the portfolio because they're following our direction in terms of how to do it today and they're pretty good at what they do anyway. So I don't really see anything there. I think, obviously, we probably could get a little bit of cost leverage out of the cost part of this just because of our scale.","Chris Brendler","Okay, great. One quick follow-up on Pets Best. Can you -- is that going to be a material impact to CareCredit revenue? I assume it's not a lending operation and insurance part is very interesting to me and just wanted to know how big it is in terms of\u2026","Margaret Keane","Yeah. It's not going to have -- it won't have a big impact on the\u2026","Brian Doubles","In the short term.","Margaret Keane","\u2026in the short term.","Chris Brendler","Great. Thanks, guys.","Margaret Keane","Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Thank you.","Operator","We have our next question from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research.","Matthew O\u2019Neill","Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my questions. I was hoping you could give an update or some more details around the PayPal, sort of, APR repricing maybe the extent to which the newer APRs are finding their way into the overall book, and maybe what size the co-brand is versus the original Bill Me Later program.","Brian Doubles","Yeah. So, we rolled those APR changes out earlier and they're going to bleed in over, I would say the balance of this year but into probably the first half of next year before we really feel the benefit of those.","So right now if you look at the yield on the overall company, it was down a little over 20 basis points year-over-year. If you exclude PayPal, which does run at a lower yield than the overall business, yields would have actually been up slightly year-over-year. So that APR lift hasn't worked its way through the yield yet. You'll really see that towards the end of this year and into 2020.","Matthew O\u2019Neill","Thanks. That was helpful.","Brian Doubles","And what was the second part of your question, Matt?","Matthew O\u2019Neill","That was it on PayPal. I did have an unrelated follow-up, however, on CECL. If you guys had any updated views on that as far as the discussion with the regulators. And maybe from a holistic perspective, are you guys looking at, or are the regulators looking at it inclusive of RSA and the implicit risk sharing? Or is it very focused on you guys alone?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. That is great question. So we haven't put a range out there. Obviously, CECL will result in an increase to the level of the reserves just given we move from that incurred model to a lifetime coverage. We are currently running in parallel. We are working through some of the big areas of implementation like the life of a revolving product the payment allocation methodologies and things like that.","There's some discussion out there that reserves are going to double for all credit card portfolio that is not our expectation. So, I would expect we'll probably put out a range most likely in the third quarter after we've run in parallel for a period of time.","And then as you correctly highlighted the big open question on all this is how do the regulators view our capital going forward. In theory, the more reserves you set aside, you should need less capital for unexpected losses. But we're working through that with the regulators right now.","In terms of the RSAs, we actually -- we factor in the RSAs in all of our stress tests they're built into our models. So, we do get credit for that buffering effect that the RSAs have in a stress scenario. So, we do factor that in. It is part of our stress testing models and our capital plans.","Matthew O'Neill","Great. Thank you very much. Appreciate it.","Brian Doubles","Great. Thanks.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Dominick Gabriele with Oppenheimer.","Dominick Gabriele","Hi, thanks so much for taking my questions. Can you just touch on the balances -- the balancing act between trying to drive deposit as a percent of your total funding and with the rates paid for those additional balances?","And kind of what we've seen are some of the competitors have actually cut deposit rates on some of their products. So, what does that mean if you think about your funding costs going forward into 2019? Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes. So, I would say a couple of things. First, when we look at our deposit beta it's actually been a little bit better than we expected through the rate cycle so far. So, our beta has been around 50%. That includes the period last year where we were pre-funding PayPal. During that time period, we were very competitive on rates.","Just given some of the trends we are seeing so far this year as well as the fact that we don't have to pre-fund a large portfolio, we're actually hoping we won't need to be as competitive on rate this year. We've actually seen really strong deposit growth so far this year and we haven't moved our rates at all.","So, look I think we expect to pay slightly higher betas than the norm. But with all that said it doesn't change our view that deposits are still our most attractive source of funds for the business.","Dominick Gabriele","Absolutely. And then if I can ask one more. Can you talk about CareCredit and you've had some nice steady growth there in receivables year-over-year. And then how Walgreens and some of these new partnerships could potentially continue to accelerate that growth in CareCredit? Thanks so much.","Margaret Keane","Yes sure. So, we see CareCredit as a big opportunity for us. Obviously, health care payments and general continue to go up for consumers and CareCredit really gives you the opportunity to segment those costs. And so what we've really been building out is a couple of things.","One, continuing to grow the core by winning new partnerships; two, expanding the utility of the card so things like Walgreens is an example of that where we allow customers to buy outside of the -- the office they bought in but use that card in a Walgreens. And we are seeing really nice traction there. And then the third area we're really looking at is expanding into other verticals that we are not in today. So, last year alone we expanded into 25 different health care verticals.","The one thing I would say is we never really want to be in a position where we are making some kind of credit decision related to health care life and death situations or anything like that. This is really all about those procedures that are elective procedures where consumers want to segregate that part of their expense.","And so I would say we expect to continue to see really nice growth in CareCredit and we are looking at ways to really accelerate that growth in the verticals we are in today and verticals we're looking to expand into. So, pretty excited.","Dominick Gabriele","Thanks so much. I really appreciate it.","Operator","And we have our next question from David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Hi good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Maybe a different angle on trying to get a sense for organic portfolio growth outside of PayPal. Just wondering on a no-name basis, when we look at the top five retail programs outside of PayPal, are any of those experiencing year-over-year declines in ending receivables?","Margaret Keane","No. I don't believe any of them are. I think it's important to note that even if a retailer's sales are off, in most cases our credit card program is two times -- two to three times what the retailer sales are because our customer base that have the cards are the most loyal customers. And as retailers look to bring sales back into the store, obviously the card becomes a really big driver of that performance. So we have not seen deterioration in that way.","Brian Doubles","Yes. The only thing I would add is look you can always have -- quarter-to-quarter, you can have some movement in any of these partnerships. But to Margaret's point, if you look over the long term whether its one year or two years, we are taking -- we're gaining penetration in all of our big programs and we feel pretty good about our position.","Margaret Keane","I think the other piece that's important to note is the digital aspect. As we continue to build out the digital capabilities with our partners and that becomes an even bigger part of the channel, we are able to offset maybe some of the in-store traffic falloff with the omni-channel approach. And we know that if a customer buys mobilely and in store, they're the best customer. They tend to come back over and over. So we continue to use that data analytics to help our partners really grow those sales and continue to expand our digital capability.","David Scharf","Got it. And you -- that response actually prefaced my follow-up which was whether or not there are any sort of wallet share type of metrics that you're able to share with us in terms of through the...","Margaret Keane","I can kind of give you overall -- yes I can give you overall like mobile growth. So we said this quarter, we grew 37% on application growth versus the same quarter of last year. 48% of our applications are now occurring digitally, which is continues to grow and be a big part. So one of the things we see is customers before they even go to shop or actually applying through their mobile app or online to get the cards, obviously the value props are really important in this too in terms of how we work with our partners to get those value props in place. And in Retail Card, we had -- 37% of the sales were online sales. So again, this is a channel that continues to grow. We continue to grow really nicely in the digital sales. So again, we're pretty happy about the performance and expect that to continue to grow.","David Scharf","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies. Please go ahead, John.","John Hecht","Sorry guys. Thanks guys. One side of question on PayPal. Is the amount of deferred interest for the net portfolio any different than the rest of the portfolio?","Brian Doubles","It works similarly to the rest of the portfolio, John.","John Hecht","Okay. And then most of my questions have been asked and answered, but I guess the final one I'd have or secondary one I'd have Brian is, when do you think you'll be able to talk publicly about the capital plans? I mean what -- when do you think that the regulators will be able to approve your plan and you'll get to the Board of Directors process and so forth?","Brian Doubles","Yes. So like I said, we reviewed and the Board approved our plan. We submitted that to the regulators late March. So that's very much in line with what we did last year. So if you look at the last two years, we announced something around mid-May, so that would be our hope. Obviously, we don't control that entire process. But at least on our side, what we've done is try to follow a very similar process with both the Board and our regulators. So we're hopeful that we have a similar result this year in terms of timing.","John Hecht","Appreciate that. Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, John.","Greg Ketron","Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, operator. Good morning everyone and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us.","In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules, and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.","Before we get started, I wanted to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin on slide three. Our performance were strong across several key business drivers in the third quarter, broad based growth helps drives earnings of $671 million or $0.91 per share.","Loan receivables grew 14% and we generated strong net interest income growth of 9%. Purchase volume increased 11% and average active accounts were up 9%. As you know, we completed our acquisition of the PayPal Credit program in the third quarter and that is now included in our results. Brian will discuss some of the associated impacts later in the call.","We also recently renewed and extended key relationships and added some exciting new partnerships. In our Retail Card sales platform, we extended our strategic partnership with Lowe, building on a nearly four decade long relationship. As part of this extension, we will continue to manage and service both their consumer and commercial credit card programs.","A key focus for the program is making the consumer experience even easier by further advancing technological capabilities to enhance the digital experience for Lowe's customer, tapping the power of mobile for areas such as payments and applications. We look forward to continuing to work closely with Lowe's, to help them grow sales and enhance their customers' experience.","We are also very pleased to renew our partnership with JCPenney. This nearly two decade long partnership has been very successful with high engagement. Working together we have leveraged data analytics to uncover new customer insights, further personalizing the customer experience.","We have also helped JCPenney integrate credit payments into their mobile app. The deep collaboration between us has already proven to benefit customers across all shopping channels and we will continue to leverage advance data analytics to help drive even better experiences for card holders. We have been able to add significant value to the program in a dynamic market environment and look forward to continuing the strategic partnership with JCPenney.","In our Payment Solutions sales platform, we renewed key relationships with Associated Materials, a leading manufacturer and distributor of exterior residential building products and Generac, a leading supplier of backup power and prime power products systems and engine power tools. We also signed some exciting new programs during the quarter.","In Payment Solutions we added a new partnership with Fred Myers Jewelers, a national jewelry chain and in CareCredit we added a new partnership with Eargo a hearing aid manufacturer. Over the past several quarters we have broaden the scope of our valuable CareCredit network adding more than 25 new specialties where the card is accepted.","Our focus on expanding CareCredit's utility has led to the acceptance of the card in medical specialties including primary care and general practice, physical therapy, ambulatory surgery, durable medical equipment and urgent care. The Care credit card can be used for deductibles, co-pays, planned medical procedures, annual wellness visits, imaging and other out of pocket costs.","As you know expanding acceptance in utility of the successful card and network has been a key objective for us as we strive to move these cards to the top of the cardholders' wallet, migrating towards more repeat purchase behavior. To that end, we have made substantial progress in improving the usage of our cards as evidenced by our reuse rates. For CareCredit the reuse rate in the third quarter was 53% and for Payment Solutions it was 29% of total purchase volume.","Ease of application and use of our cards while in trying that cardholders have access to their cards, rewards and account information across whatever channel they choose to use is critical. As the mobile channel becomes particularly important to retailers and their customers who are using apps to make purchases and much more, we have developed tools to ensure our cardholders can easily utilize their cards in this increasingly popular channel.","SyPi our mobile plug-in application is an example of an investment we made to expand our mobile engagement capabilities and where we are receiving a very positive response from our retail partners. SyPi is currently being used in 19 of our retail partners' apps including GAP, Lowe's and JCPenney and recently crossed over 1 billion in credit card bill payments since the product's launched in 2016. Comparing September of this year to last year, the number of visits, unique visitors and total payments have increased over 200%.","Our overall digital sales penetration for our retail card consumers have been growing. Digital sales penetration was 33% in the third quarter. 46% of applications are happening online with the mobile channel alone growing 59% over the same quarter of last year. Overall, this was a strong quarter for us. We continue to generate organic growth and renew and extent important relationships, while also adding new programs, extending the utility of our cards and focusing on digital innovations to further improve the customer experience.","Before I turn the call over to Brian, I will give a quick review on how each of our sales platforms performed during the quarter, which is on slide five of the presentation. In Retail Card, strong results were driven by our PayPal Credit program acquisition, along with continued organic growth. Loan receivables increased 16% and interest and fees on loans increased 12% over last year.","Purchase volume grew 11% and average active accounts were up 10%. As I noted earlier, we had a very active quarter in our Retail Card sales platform with the renewal and expansion of the Lowe's and JCPenney program. We are very excited about these significant relationships and their future potential.","Payment Solutions delivered another strong quarter. We generated broad based growth across the sales platform, with particular strength in home furnishings and power products that resulted in loan receivables growth of 9%. Interest and fees on loans increased 8%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 10% and average active accounts increased 5%. We are pleased to have added the Fred Meyer Jewelers partnership and to renew our programs with Associated Materials, and Generac.","CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 8% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Interests and fees on loans also increased 6%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 9% and average active accounts increased 5%.","Expanding into new specialties thereby increasing utility of the CareCredit card is helping to drive performance. We are pleased to add new partnerships including Eargo. We are also making investments such as enhancing the mobile app to continue to support the network and its growth potential.","We continue to deliver solid growth across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter and we are extending relationships, signing new programs and providing value added solutions to our partners and cardholders.","Before I turn the call over to Brian, I will make a quick comment about Wal-Mart. Though we currently have no updates to provide, I want to emphasize that we continue to work closely with Wal-Mart to support the program. And we'll do everything on our end to ensure a successful program transition next year.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. This morning we reported third quarter earnings of $671 million, which translates to $0.91 per diluted share. In addition to adding the PayPal Credit portfolio this quarter, we continue to deliver solid growth with loan receivables up 14% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 10% over last year.","Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business, as well as the risk adjusted returns on this growth. The interest and fee income growth were driven primarily by the growth in receivables. Purchase volume grew 11% over last year and average active account growth was 9%. The positive trends continued in average balances with growth in average balance per average active account up 5% compared to last year.","We're also pleased to have announced the extension of both the Lowe's and JCPenney programs. In both cases, we are able to renew these relationships at attractive risk adjusted returns. While in both cases, we made some modest changes to the economic sharing in these programs. The earnings profile for us going forward will be very similar to our current run rate on these programs.","We were also able to enhance some of the growth commitments and value propositions in the programs, as well as some of the contractual protections we have, which will improve our risk profile and benefit us over the long-term. At the end of the day these are very good renewals for us with improved alignment on growth and very attractive risk adjusted returns.","RSAs increased $66 million or 8% from last year, excluding the impact of adding the PayPal Credit portfolio, the primary drivers of the increase for growth and lower provision expense. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4% for the quarter compared to 4.2% last year. For the fourth quarter we expect the RSAs to be around 4% compared against the third quarter, the RSA will be driven by improving credit trends, partially offset by the seasonal decline we typically see in the fourth quarter.","The provision for loan losses increased $141 million or 11% from last year, driven by the PayPal Credit reserve build, partially offset by moderating credit trends. The reserve build in the quarter was $364 million, including $272 million associated with adding the PayPal portfolio and $92 million related to the core portfolio. The reserve build was lower than our expectations as credit performance was better than we had expected.","I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation. Other income was down $13 million, while interchange was up $18 million driven by continued growth in out of store spending on our dual card. This was offset by loyalty expense that increased $28 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions.","As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs. So there's a partial offset on each of these items. As we noted last quarter, we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near 100% with some quarterly fluctuation.","Other expenses increased $96 million or 10% versus last year, driven primarily by expenses related to on-boarding the PayPal Credit program, as well as expenses related to growth. We expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by the impact of adding the PayPal program until we are comparing against quarters with PayPal and the run rate.","We will also continue to make strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities and investments to automate and streamline the back office. So overall, the company generated solid performance for the third quarter, especially considering the reserve build related to adding the PayPal portfolio.","Moving to slide seven, I will cover net interest income and margin performance for the quarter. Net interest income was up 9%, driven primarily by the addition of the PayPal portfolio and loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.41%, compared to last year's margin of 16.74%. The margin was mainly in line with our expectations. The largest impact on margin performance was the impact of the PayPal portfolio acquisition.","As expected the margin increased from last quarter's level of 15.33% as the liquidity resulting from pre-funding was deployed when the PayPal portfolio was added on July 2nd. We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year. As we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we're holding and have deployed excess liquidity to support the PayPal portfolio acquisition and receivables growth. Also impacting the margin was a decline in the loan receivables yield and an increase in interest bearing liability cost.","The loan receivables yield was 21.11%, a decline of 67 basis points versus last year, mainly due to the impact of adding the PayPal portfolio. The increase in total interest bearing liabilities costs was 43 basis points to 2.36%, reflecting higher benchmark rates. We expect to see the normal seasonal decline in yield in the fourth quarter given the build and receivables during holiday season. This has been as much as 50 to 60 basis points historically. As a result, we expect the net interest margin to trend down into the 15.75% to 16% range in the fourth quarter, which is in line with our outlook for margins to be in the 16% range for the second half of the year.","Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30 plus delinquency rate improved a 4.59%, compared to 4.80% last year and the 90 plus delinquency rate declined to 2.09% and 2.22% last year.","The year-over-year trends in both the 30 plus and 90 plus delinquency rates were stable to improving for the second quarter in a row with the 30 plus delinquency right now 21 basis points below the prior year, reflecting the impact of our underwriting refinements and a more modest impact for normalization.","Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 4.97%, compared to 4.95% last year and in line with our expectations. While the net charge-off rate benefited from the addition of the PayPal Credit portfolio, the credit trends in the core portfolio also continue to moderate. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.11% and the reserve build from the second quarter was $364 million.","As I noted earlier the reserve build was lower than our expectations due to the improving credit trends resulting from the underwriting refinements we made. The core reserve build was $92 million and the reserve build on the PayPal portfolio acquired in the quarter was $272 million, both below our expectations.","As we have been noting in recent quarters, we continue to see favorable trends resulting from the impact related to the underwriting refinements on two key metrics; our more recent vintages, and our purchase volume growth. First, the most recent vintages continue to trend in line with our expectations. The vintage curve data suggest that the 2017 vintage is performing better than 2016 and more in line with our 2015 vintage. And while it is still early to fully assess the 2018 vintage trends, the results so far are similar 2017.","These underwriting refinements continue to drive changes to our purchase volume mix by FICO score. If you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification excluding the impact of the acquired PayPal portfolio, we continue to grow at a fairly strong pace and accounts with a FICO score of 721 and higher, which increased 11% over the same quarter last year. While purchase volume for accounts of FICO score is of 660 and below, actually declined 12%, reflecting some of the modest tightening we have been doing. These trends help and form our view of loss expectations for this year and beyond.","Looking forward, we typically see a seasonal uptick in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter and continue to expect net charge-offs to be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range for 2018. Regarding reserve build for the fourth quarter, we expect the reserve build on our existing or core portfolio to continue to transition to be more growth driven and will be in the $75 million to $100 million range next quarter.","We expect the reserve build related to the PayPal Credit portfolio due to the accounting requirements around portfolio acquisitions will result in an additional reserve build in the $125 million to $150 million range, for a total reserve build in the $200 million to $250 million next quarter.","In summary, while credit continues to normalize from here, we expect the pace of the change and the impact on our results to continue to moderate as we move forward, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk adjusted returns.","Moving to slide nine, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $1.1 billion, up 10% over last year and were primarily driven by the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program and growth. The efficiency ratio was 31% for the quarter versus 30.4% last year and in line with our expectations. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of strategic investments. We continue to expect the efficiency ratio to be in the 31% range for 2018.","Moving to slide 10, the key highlights are maintaining our funding mix and strong liquidity and capital levels, while on-boarding the PayPal portfolio. We also made progress in deploying capital to our capital plans and growth by executing the capital plan we announced in May, which increased our dividends and the size of our share repurchases through June of next year.","We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity profile. Over the last year we have grown our deposits nearly $8 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This was a key component of our funding strategy for the PayPal portfolio.","This puts deposits at 72% of our funding maintaining the level we have been operating at over the last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program, by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building at our digital capabilities. Longer term we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers.","On the wholesale funding side, we were pleased to do our first public issuance out of the newly established Synchrony Card Issuance Trust during the quarter. The issuance had strong demand and we ended up issuing 1 billion in three year fixed rate funding.","Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 14.2% CET 1 under the fully phased in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.2% on a fully phased in basis last year, a 300 basis point reduction, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio growth and continued execution of our capital plan.","During the quarter we continued to execute on the capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.21 per share and repurchased $966 million of common stock during the third quarter. This represented 30.3 million shares repurchase during the quarter, more than double the amount of shares we have been averaging in the prior four quarters. We have approximately $1 billion remaining in potential share repurchases of the $2.2 billion our Board authorized through the fourth quarters ending June 30, 2019.","We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $23 billion, which equated to 22% of our total assets. This is down from 24% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity to support the PayPal portfolio acquisition.","Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet, with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Before I conclude, I wanted to recap our current view for the fourth quarter and the year. First, regarding our margin outlook, we expect to see normal seasonal decline in yield in the fourth quarter given the build and receivables during holiday season. This has been as much as 50 to 60 basis points historically. As a result, we expect the net interest margin to trend into the 15.75% to 16% range in the fourth quarter in line with our outlook that the margin would run in the 16% range for the second half of this year. We expect RSAs to be around 4% in the fourth quarter.","Regarding credit, we continue to expect net charge offs to be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range for the year with the typical seasonal uptick in net charge-offs in the fourth quarter. We expect the reserve build on our existing or core portfolio to continue to transition to be more growth driven and will be in the $75 million to $100 million range next quarter. We expect the reserve build related to the PayPal Credit portfolio due to the accounting requirements around portfolio acquisitions will result in an additional reserve build in the $125 million to $150 range, for a total reserve build in the $200 million to $250 million range next quarter.","Turning to expenses, we continue to generate positive operating leverage and still expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year.","In summary, the business continues to generate good growth with attractive long-term returns. And while the PayPal Credit portfolio acquisition creates a degree of EPS dilution in the half of this, we expected to be an EPS accretive in 2019 and help provide a nice tailwind to EPS as we move forward.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. We generated strong results this quarter, significantly expanding our relationship with PayPal with the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program, while also continuing to drive organic growth. We renewed key partnerships and signed exciting new programs. We continue to invest in our digital capabilities and network, focusing on ease of card use across platforms as well as card utility, enhancing our competitive position in the rapidly changing marketplace.","We are also seeing other important elements of our business, such as credit quality perform in line with our expectations. All of this contributes to our ability to return capital to shareholders and we were pleased to increase our dividend and share repurchases this quarter. We are also focused on aligning capital through organic growth and program acquisitions. We focus on risk adjusted returns, while pursuing strategies that help us to profitably grow the business and deliver value.","I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Hey, guys. Thanks very much for taking my questions. First, Margaret, you did refer to the Wal-Mart working with them to ensure the most I guess seamless transition. In the prior call as you guys have talked about various options, I'm wondering can you give us an update on how you proceed with those options and maybe give us some clarification on when you might have a final decision to make.","Margaret Keane","Sure. We're not through those options. So what I'd say is we really can't give you a reflection of which one it is, but we're working closely with them now on working through valuation and we expect to have clarity by the first quarter. I think what we said in the last call is that either option whether the portfolio transitions to another issuer or whether we keep the portfolio, both cases we believe that we can replace the EPS, so focused on working with them, focused on getting to a place that we can have a final decision in the first quarter.","John Hecht","Okay. Thanks. And then and then PayPal, I guess a couple of kind of details of PayPal, were there any one time expenses this quarter tied to kind of on-boarding that portfolio? Brian, you've given some guidance about Q4 ALL build will there be any other ALL build next year? And then how do we think about kind of the integration of those credit metrics, I guess, the NCO trajectory, as that seasons into the calendar year of 2019?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, John. So I wouldn't say they're really any one time expenses related to that. We did do some upfront spending before we brought the portfolio on, just to get a team in place to manage it. You saw some of that actually in the second quarter, a little more this quarter. But, other than that, I would say that where you're seeing an impact on the expenses is really running through professional fees, which you saw increase, that's really driven by the interim servicing until our team takes that over in full.","And so you'll see that expense come down as we get into kind of the first half of 2019. And then that will be replaced by true employee costs on our side as we take over the full kind of operation of that portfolio.","In terms of the ALLL, I mean, it came in right in line with our expectations if anything, it was a little bit better. So the reserve came in at $272 million that was better than we expected. Overall, we're very pleased with the credit trends that we're seeing on PayPal, so no change to the full year net charge-off guidance.","If you remember, just due to some of the purchase accounting on PayPal, we gave you guidance with and without, so 5.5% to 5.8% with and without PayPal. So it moved us around within the range, but wasn't significant enough to change the range for the full year. And that outlook is still good.","So I'm sorry, John, do you have one more?","John Hecht","Yes, I guess just given the on-boarding process and the accounting associated with it, when should we see the PayPal charge-off trends, you influence the overall book?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So I would think about PayPal, you kind of burn off that mark pretty quick in the remainder of this year, and then you'll start to see some upward bias in the net charge-off rate as we move into 2019, just given the overall credit profile of PayPal relative to our book. So think about it not having much of an impact as we get through 2018. And then some modest upward bias in the net charge-off rate for 2019, which obviously we'll give you more color on that when we do our outlook for the full year.","John Hecht","Okay. Appreciate it guys. Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Donald Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Donald Fandetti","Margaret, there's been a little bit of investor discussions of maybe Cap One isn't super excited to buy the portfolio. I know you can't comment on that deal specifically, but can you help us understand, when you win deals historically, besides just getting the net interest income, what are some of the other reasons, why you want to buy that portfolio, is it data, things of that nature?","And then the second part of the question would be, if you do sell it and you move forward with the buybacks, could you also make a sizable portfolio acquisition if one were to come up that was unique or do you feel like you're super committed to the buybacks and that would probably limit your ability?","Margaret Keane","Yes, so I think the first part I would comment on, probably the most important aspect of buying a book is really around the customer. What you really want to do is ensure that smooth transition from one issuer to another.","So as we think about when we do an acquisition particularly of a big book that would be something that would be really important for us because one the customer keeping that transition smooth, keeping the card is utility going. You point on data and analytics, all those elements are extremely important. So those would be the things that we would be focusing on in terms of an acquisition of a portfolio.","In terms of, could we purchase a portfolio, obviously, yes, we have said that's been one of our strategies all along in terms of how we would deploy capital, similar to how we did PayPal. But obviously would have to be at the right return, the right risk adjusted margin so that we drive the bottom-line the way we want for the company. I don't know Brian if you would add.","Brian Doubles","Yes, Don, the only thing I would add is when we communicated our plan on both options last quarter, we did indicate that share repurchases and higher returning alternative. So that would include portfolio acquisitions obviously, we're looking at making bigger investments in the organic growth of the business to investing in high growth programs like PayPal, like TJX, more investment in CareCredit and Payment Solutions.","But then if something came along as Margaret said, with the right risk adjusted returns and attractive portfolio acquisition, we would absolutely take a look at it.","Donald Fandetti","Okay, that's helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks, good morning. Yes, I have two model related questions for Brian and then one for Margaret. Just on the model questions, Brian, the RSA coming in better than expected as a percentage of receivables despite the renewals and better credit, is that a good run rate to think about going forward as we look into next year?","And then secondly on the PayPal allowance build. Is there a way to think about how much of the portfolio you have reserved for by the end of the year based on what you're expecting? I just want to think about how much more needs to be reserved for, as we move into next year given the accounting.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, Sanjay. So first on the RSAs, the RSAs came in a little bit better than we expected, that's been a trend all year. In the quarter, what really drove that was some program mix that we're seeing better growth, higher growth and programs where we pay a lower RSA percentage so that was a big driver. And then obviously we are no longer making payments on the Toys\"R\"Us program.","And then the other factor is we did have slightly lower yield just given the improvement in the credit trends, lower delinquencies. And so that drives a little less revolve lower interest and fees, et cetera. So, that's what really drove the result in the quarter.","And then as you think about the fourth quarter, it probably worth just commenting on a couple drivers there, we expect it will coming around the same 4% level. Part of that's driven by credit continuing to improve, so that results in a higher RSA. And then as you probably remember we have that normal seasonality we see moving from the third quarter to the fourth quarter, which brings the RSA back down. So, couple of puts and takes that gets you back into that, gets you back into that 4% range.","So then on the PayPal reserves, again it came in a little bit better than we expected just given the credit trends that we're seeing on that portfolio for the quarter. We gave you a pretty good indication of what to expect for the fourth quarter. When you add both of those up you are in that $400 million range.","And if you go back and look at the size of the portfolio that we disclosed there is some information out there in terms of what PayPal disclosed on the loss rate for that portfolio. If you assume 14 to 15 months coverage on that, you assume that we get about 400 million done this year. That gives you a pretty good indication of what to expect for 2019 in order to complete that build.","So, nothing specific at this point, but I think you have got most of the pieces just given that to come up with a pretty good estimate. And the way I would think about it moving through 2019, obviously it should continue to come down. So you saw $272 million, you got our guidance for the fourth quarter that will come down, it will come down a bit more in the first quarter and then kind of prorate through the balance of 2019.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And I am sorry, one more. The delinquency rate, was that impacted by PayPal in anyway?","Brian Doubles","Yes, actually the core 30 plus delinquency rate was a little bit better than we reported, so better than the 21 basis points down year-over-year, with a partially offset for PayPal. So PayPal brought it up a few basis points.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. And then Margaret, just following up on the discussion on portfolio acquisitions, one of your competitors is considering strategic alignment - realignments and that might create an opportunity that buy a sizable smaller portfolio, a private label relationship. Could you just talk about your appetite, if something like that were to come up? Thanks.","Margaret Keane","Obviously we take a look, but we'd have to evaluate what the overall portfolio was what we would like to be part of in that portfolio and it's hard for us to really comment on that, given that that's not really out there yet. But obviously if we did, we would obviously take a look.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Right, thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I had a question on the mechanics under a portfolio sale. If you were to say move the portfolio to held for sale at the end of Q1, is that reasonable to expect at that point you'd to hold only four months of allowance through the July 31st portfolio transfer date and would look to use the benefits of those reserve releases to start incremental buybacks even before the portfolio officially goes away.","Brian Doubles","Yes, that's more or less how it works. So the point at which we have confirmation that the portfolio is going to transition or move off of our balance sheet we would move it to held for sale it start to shorten that reserve period between the time once you move in and the time you expect to transfer it. So that's a pretty reasonable assumption, Bill.","Bill Carcache","Okay, great. Thank you. And I had a follow-up question on renewal risk for you, Margaret. For many years you guys were able sustain very attractive through the cycle risk adjusted margins inside of GE, but today many investors are questioning whether there really is a secret sauce and some believe your larger competitors can simply swooped in and take away your customers when the contracts come up to renewal.","This loss of the partnerships and RSA pressure wasn't something that we saw when you guys were inside of GE. So what is it that is fundamentally changed since you guys went public that makes this a greater risk now, or is it not if you could just comment on that that would be helpful?","Margaret Keane","Sure. We don't see it as a great risk. I view Wal-Mart as an outlier. I think if you just look at what we've done in this month where we've renewed Lowe's so by the way we'll have over four decades, and the fact that we've renewed JCPenney, which we have for two decades. I think our experience and our trends have shown that we can renew deals.","So I'm not sitting here saying that all of a sudden there is a big competitive shift. Look, our view is we're one of the best private label issuers. We know how to service the retail marketplace. We've built out a ton of capabilities, and honestly I view Wal-Mart as an outlier.","Brian Doubles","Hey, Bill, the other thing I would just point out, if you go back to the last round of renewals that we did, those were all done with the knowledge that we were going to separate from GE. So we're really in kind of the second or third wave of renewals. And as Margaret said, we think about Wal-Mart as an outlier. Our track record on renewals has been very strong with and without GE.","Bill Carcache","That's very helpful, thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. When we think about credit performance, obviously the primary driver is FICO score and credit quality. But one of the other influential factors is utility. I'm curious when you think about the PayPal product versus your core private label. If there is utility factor that you think will influence credit performance related to delinquencies and charge-offs over the longer term.","Brian Doubles","Yes, Rick, I mean certainly that's a factor I would say broadly across the portfolio. But I wouldn't say that PayPal is unique relative to other products and other programs that we have. I think the elements that you talked initially drive more of the performance. So whether it's the FICO even though we don't use really to underwrite we use it to score the portfolio. Our proprietary scores are really the primary driver in terms of what we expect to see on overall credit performance. So to factor but I wouldn't highlight anything unique on PayPal.","Rick Shane","Got it. So when you differentiate the performance for PayPal versus your core portfolio, what do you think the primary factor is?","Brian Doubles","I would say I will go back to what I said it's the overall credit profile and how we underwrite that portfolio relative to others. I think as we've talked about in the past, if you look at all of our programs, we underwrite based on a set of overall guidelines overall parameters, but then we drill down into the individual program level.","And we underwrite a little bit differently based on the customer mix, the customer profile that through the door population in terms of who is apply for credit. And it's a combination of all those factors that mosaic that gives us the overall credit performance that we target for that program.","Rick Shane","Okay, great. Thank you. That's very helpful.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thank you. Was interested in hearing how you thought about the potential trade-offs of renegotiating Lowe's well in advance of - and when that was up in an environment where presumably it's quite competitive and you may have to give away some economics to renew versus the ability to kind of push out some of the renewal risk on that relationship?","Brian Doubles","Yes, I think we have been pretty clear, Mark, that we're always working to renew all of our big partners and if we can do that outside of a competitive process and do in a way where we protect our return profile and our economics and do in a way that we get some really good alignment around growth or change some things around the value prop or acquisition incentives and that's always something we're looking to do and we have got a pretty good track record of doing that.","So I wouldn't say there is anything unique in either the - into the Lowe's or the JCPenney renewals, I think these things naturally happen as part of these relationships.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Where there any enhancements made to the value prepositions around out of the cards in those renewal programs?","Brian Doubles","What I would say and I can't get too specific, but in all of these cases when you early renew typically there is some puts and takes in terms of the economics and what we're going to do in terms of the value prop and acquisition incentive. And in both cases JCPenney or Lowe's we got some really nice commitments around growth and some things that we're going to change, but nothing that's been announced at this point.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS. Eric perhaps you're muted on your end.","Eric Wasserstrom","Yes, I am sorry, can you hear me now?","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Eric Wasserstrom","Yes, sorry about that. Just Brian, one question on PayPal and then a follow-up on Wal-Mart. On the PayPal portfolio other than credit performance which you've already guided to a little bit for the fourth quarter, now that you have seen it perform for about one quarter. Is there anything about it, that is behaving differently than your expectation?","Brian Doubles","No, I'd say it's performing very much in line with our expectations, I would maybe point to credit performance being a touch better than we thought, that's what drove the lower reserve build, the turn of books slightly different what we thought, but overall we're very pleased with the performance and it's pretty much in line with our expectation. So, we're pretty excited to get focused on growth.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thank you for that. And then just to follow-up on Wal-Mart and I appreciate that you have already talked a lot about it and you're still in the midst of this negotiation. But is it your baseline assumption that the portfolio will be sold or are you still pursuing each avenue on like a 50-50 probability for example?","Margaret Keane","We're still on discussion, so we - I wouldn't put any kind of 50-50 or anything on it. I think we're working closely with Wal-Mart again, our job is to come to a conclusion in the first quarter and whatever the decision is, we are committed to really ensuring a smooth transition and really delivering for Wal-Mart through the end of the contract.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research.","Matthew O'Neill","Yes, hi thanks for taking my questions. I think basically two for Brian. The first around the underwriting refinements that seem to start in earnest this year and the results you discussed regarding the performance above sort of 720, 721 and 660 and below. I was wondering if that's a trend that we should kind of continue to expect beyond 2018? And maybe just a high level view on kind of loan growth outlook as a result.","And then if I could for a follow-up, one of your smaller competitors commented recently around seeing minimal if any impacts from CCIL. And I was just wondering if you could comment on that regarding your business?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So first on the underwriting changes, I think our expectation is that we're going to start to lap those periods at some point probably towards the end of the first half of 2019. So I think that trend continues for a couple more quarters and then some of that comes down you get back to a more what we will consider a core growth rate.","But overall I think we're very pleased with the results of those underwriting refinements. I think we told you about a year ago that we expected the credit trends to start to moderate and level-off in the second half of 2018. And if anything the performance has been in line to slightly better than that. So, we're still seeing really good volume on accounts greater than 720 as we indicated. And what we're seeing on the accounts below 660 FICO was very, very targeted, very intentional, and it's having the desire results.","And I think if you look across, whether it's a reserve build or the delinquency metrics, everything is performing in line to slightly better than we thought. So I think as you move into 2019, you start to lap some of those periods and you start to see those, the impact on purchase volume level off a bit.","And then your second question just on CCIL, I think there's obviously still a lot of work to do here. Most credit card issuers would say it's going to result in some increasing level of reserves. Just going from an incurred loss model for lifetime losses, I think the vast majority of issuers are expecting some level of increase. But there is still a lot that's undecided at this point. You've got to determine the life of the revolving product. Depending on which payment allocation methodology you pick, you get a different answer. Frankly, this is, it's fairly challenging accounting guidance to apply to revolving credit.","So look, we're doing a lot of work on this, we're participating in all the industry groups and talking to other issuers. Our teams internally are hard at work modeling this. We got six to nine months to kind of run in parallel here and when we have an estimate of the impact we'll certainly share it with all of you.","Matthew O'Neill","Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Coffey with Susquehanna.","James Friedman","It's Jamie, for John. Thanks for taking my question. But periodically, Margaret, you would give e-commerce related disclosure. I was wondering if you had something equivalent that you could share so we can kind of mark your progress with that. And maybe I'll just ask my second one upfront, in case you don't happy to have that one. So, if you could talk at least qualitatively about the deal pipeline for 2019 and 2020, as is been alluded to one of your competitors has talked rather enthusiastically about the potential contribution coming up from new opportunities. How does it look out there? And is there a lot of opportunity for you guys? Thank you.","Margaret Keane","Sure. So I would say that, we're very focused on continuing to assent digital capabilities. I think this is an area that we know becomes a critical part for our partners. And so our year-over-year mobile growth was 59% and our online penetration for Retail Card was 33%, which was up 9 percentage points.","James Friedman","Thank you.","Margaret Keane","And about 46% of our applications occurred digitally in the third quarter. So certainly our mobile enhancements and capabilities and things we continue to build out are having a really good impact.","On the pipeline, we feel good about the pipeline. I would say there's not one big deal out there right now, other than maybe some of the rumors that were started this week. So we'd have to look at that. But I think what we've been very diligent on is looking at new startups and existing programs and winning across all three platforms. And we feel good about the progress we make and what the pipeline looks like, I could say going into 2019, I really can't comment on what's going to be beyond that.","But again, we're focused on all three platforms Retail Card being one of the ones we talked a lot about. But we've been able to win very successfully in our Payment Solutions business. And I think CareCredit, we continue to expand with utility of the card, as well as expanding our partnership and expansion into new verticals. So we feel, we're poised for a strong pipeline going forward.","James Friedman","Okay, appreciate the color. I'll jump back into the queue. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. We have our next question from Chris Brendler with Buckingham.","Chris Brendler","Hi, thanks. Good morning, and thanks for taking my question. Just want to focus on the margin for a minute, you noted that you're expected to decline back into the 15.75% to 16% range. Just wanted to get a little more color around, is that just sort of liquidity portfolio being build backup or is there anything actually pressuring the margin.","And one sort of related question on the component parts, if I look at the consumer loan yield and your detail our average balance reconciliation, looks like the consumer loans here was actually relatively flat sequentially, so it's obviously a little bit surprised I thought you'd see a little more of impact from PayPal. Is there any accounting related sort of impact in there that makes it look flatter or does it actually 21.5 a good number for the PayPal portfolio? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So maybe I'll take the second one first. So if you look at the yield in the quarter, it was down driven by the PayPal acquisition obviously largely promotional balances they do come on with a lower yield. And then we also had I think as I indicated earlier a modest decline in interest and fees that was similar to what you'd expect just given the improving delinquency trends.","There was a slight reduction in yield just driven by purchase accounting that's pretty standard that burns off over the next couple of quarters. But other than that, and some of the noise related to PayPal I would say the core margins the core yield is very stable. And then as you move from the third to the fourth quarter, just the seasonal decline in yield that we see has been up to 60 basis points in the past.","And so that's really what you're seeing as you move from the third to the fourth is that seasonal declines you put on a lot of holiday balances that aren't necessarily earning as you put them on. And so that drives that seasonal decline in the fourth quarter. So other than that the core margins are pretty stable. And for the full year, we're right on top of that range that we gave you back in January for margins to be in that 15.75% to 16% range.","Chris Brendler","Okay. Probably a little early to comment on 2019, but if you could, it feels like these trends should continue into 2019. The one thing I was worried about in this quarter was pretty sizable increase in deposit costs looks like it was up on 18 basis points sequentially. But you also grew deposits pretty rapidly this quarter. So I'm wondering if maybe you hit the gas a little bit on deposits to help fund PayPal and that should settle down a little bit in terms of costs increases as you go into 2019.","Brian Doubles","Yes, I mean, nothing specific to give on 2019 margins at this point. But I think your comments are in line. So I would say that we were very competitive all year on deposits and pricing just to prefund PayPal. And so you're going to feel the effects of that for a few quarters. But our expectation is that we won't have to be as competitive as we move into 2019 that was very unique to having to prefund the PayPal transaction.","Chris Brendler","Great, thanks so much.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Dominic Gabriel with Oppenheimer.","Dominic Gabriel","Hi, thank you for taking my questions. I just wanted to ask previous question in maybe a different way. Could you see yourself look to expand partnerships with much smaller retailers than you've typically in the past have gone after. Is there - could there be a strategy shift there, where that could be a renewed focus of some sort?","Margaret Keane","Well, I think if you really look at our business we actually do deals smaller retailers particularly in our Payment Solutions platform. That's where we have a number of smaller retailers, but even in the Retail Card, depending on the retailer, we really can run the gamut from small to big. So again if the right opportunity came up it was the right partnership to get involved with, we would certainly look at it.","Dominic Gabriel","Okay, great. Thank you so much. And then real quick, just wanted to get a little more detail around the renewals; you mentioned something about maybe the tender share. Is there a chance that on those two renewals that the tender share was somehow limited at some point and now you're - they've kind of unshackled you almost to say where you can now grow within the total sales of those businesses at a faster rate than you've previously? Okay.","Margaret Keane","No, the goal is always to grow the sales. It's always more beneficial for our partners to grow sales on their cards if you will to Lowe's to grow on the Lowe's card and JCPenney to grow on the JCPenney card. Because remember, they don't pay any share in the RSAs. And then the other big positive is really around the data analytics around the customers that are using a card.","So we've never been shackled by how much. We always want to grow that penetration to as high as we possibly can. So - and I think what we were saying here is that as we continue to build out more capabilities and leverage some of our capabilities partnering with them, that just gives us a lot more opportunity as we go into these renewals.","Dominic Gabriel","Great, thank you so much. I really appreciate it.","Greg Ketron","Vanessa, we have time for one more question.","Operator","And thank you. Our last question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. I guess there was a lot of talk about the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio. But could you talk a little bit about your experience in the portfolios where you've kind of gone on your own after a partner and how that has worked and how we could think about this if it were to go in that direction and the portfolio was not sold?","Margaret Keane","Yes, I think we have two probably current examples. The first is when Hhgregg did result because they went bankrupt, we converted those cards to a new network, we created call the home network. But the other good example is Toys\"R\"Us, I mean, obviously we took - we kept that portfolio again because of the bankruptcy and converted that to a general purpose credit card.","But I would just generally say whenever a portfolio stays with us over the years, whether it didn't convert or there was a bankruptcy of some sort, we always look at ways to convert those cards, so they can be continue to be utilized. So we have processes in places to really make sure we can transfer them to even new programs, or in the one case we created a network. So we feel pretty positive that we can handle either case if we Wal-Mart were to go, or to stay, I don't know Brian, if you would add anything else.","Brian Doubles","No, I would just say that the Toys\"R\"Us conversion into a Synchrony Branded MasterCard has really paid off for us. I mean, we're seeing really good activation rates, we're seeing good sales, good spending patterns. And so it's performed very well so far. I mean, it's still early we're testing a number of different things and different strategies on that portfolio, but so far we have been pretty pleased with the performance.","Moshe Orenbuch","And the absence of revenue shared, does it help the profitability?","Brian Doubles","It certainly helps the profitability. The way that we typically think about that is that gives you more dollars to invest in the value prop. So, for Toys\"R\"Us or us we put that out with a very rich value prop, we tested 2% cash back it's performing really well. You may not need to do that in all cases, but it certainly gives you a bigger economic pool to work with to drive growth going forward.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Just a quick follow-up, the pricing changes that you made on the PayPal Credit portfolio, when do those actually phase into the yield on the loans?","Brian Doubles","Yes, you'll start to see that as we move into 2019, now you have to remember the current balances are protected so obviously that only influences go forward sales. So, it will start to bleed in, you probably won't see much in the first half, but it will bleed in throughout 2019.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks very much.","Brian Doubles","Thank you.","Greg Ketron","Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and we hope you have a great day.","Operator","And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for participating.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I'll begin on slide three. We ended 2018 with a strong fourth quarter which sets the foundation for 2019. We have a number of significant areas to cover today. So I'm going to spend my time covering our business highlights including the renewal and extensions of several key programs, as well as the direction we are going with the Walmart portfolio later this year. Brian will detail our financial results and our outlook for 2019, as well as the potential financial impact of the Walmart portfolio sale later in the call.","A very significant and exciting development in the fourth quarter was our renewal with Sam's Club, a top five program for us. By extending our strategic partnership with Sam's Club, we will continue to provide enhanced financing options for Sam's Club members across the retailer's nearly 600 clubs.","Sam's Club is a valued and longstanding partner and we are very much looking forward to continuing to deliver innovative products and capabilities and fantastic customer service to help grow membership and sales. Further, we have come to an agreement with Walmart and Capital One on the sale of the Walmart portfolio which will be acquired by Capital One. Brian will provide more details on this later in the call, but I will emphasize that in the coming months we are committed to a seamless transition of the program to Capital One.","I'm happy to report that we also renewed several other key partnerships over the last few months. We are very pleased to renew and extend our relationships with Amazon under a long-term agreement building on our 11-year relationship with them.","We continue to work with Amazon on enhancing the Amazon store card experience for account holders. We recently launched account management capabilities to a voice command using Alexa, as well as a native app where you can check balances, look up account activity and rewards and manage payments. We look forward to continuing our high level of engagement with Amazon well into the future.","We also signed a new co-brand program with eBay, building on a relationship that began in 2004.","We are excited about the launch of our new eBay MasterCard, which has attractive value props that reward cardholders with points each time they use their card on and off the eBay website with more points accumulating for purchases made through eBay. We are happy to offer this new program in partnership with one of the world's largest online marketplaces and believe we can help add significant value to eBay and its U.S. customers.","We are excited to renew our relationships with Google. Through this partnership, we provide financing for Google store hardware products including Pixel and Google Home products. We look forward to continuing to work with Google and the future prospects of this program.","During the quarter, we also extended and expanded our relationship with Qurate Retail Group, one of the largest e-commerce and mobile commerce company in the United States. As part of the expanded partnership, we will provide private label credit card services to HSN starting in August of this year.","We are, obviously, very pleased with this program. We also extended our relationship with QVC, which we have since 2005 and also with zulily, a relatively new and successful partnership.","Our recent renewals and new program wins further demonstrate our strength in the online retail space, highlighting our e-commerce and digital capabilities. We are also happy to add a new retail card partnership with Harbor Freight, a discount tool and equipment retailer with 900 stores nationwide.","In our Payment Solutions business, we renewed a key partnership with Mohawk, a leading global floor manufacturer. We also added a new relationship to our Payment Solutions business. We announced a strategic industry-first credit card partnership with Fanatics, the global leader in license sports merchandise.","The long-term partnership will offer fans a new way to pay for merchandise in their account for their favorite team and players with a branded Fanatics credit card. In addition, cardholders will receive special offers to unique sports experiences and will be part of the Fanatics FanCash loyalty program. Together, we will leverage our deep expertise in data analytics to deliver personalized shopping experiences and enhanced loyalty for fans.","During the quarter, we also significantly extended our CareCredit network and card utility with Walgreens' recent agreement to accept CareCredit in all 9,000 stores. With the program expected to launch in the first quarter of this year, cardholders will be able to use their CareCredit cards at Walgreens for all of their health and wellness feeds, including prescriptions, deductibles and co-pays. With this new relationship, CareCredit will be accepted at over 17,000 pharmacies nationwide for pharmacy, health, beauty and personal care purchases.","Also, in CareCredit, with the recent addition of a new executive partnership with the Medical Group Management Association and our successful peer review by the Health Care Financial Management Association, the CareCredit network has further positioned itself for continued rapid expansion into various new health care specialties in the health system space generally. It was not only a very productive quarter for us, but a very productive year.","We accomplished a lot in 2018 including the renewal and extension of five of our largest ongoing programs: PayPal, Lowe's, JCPenney, Amazon and Sam's Club. Across all of our platforms, we renewed more than 50 existing partnerships, but also signing more than 35 new business deals. We also expanded into 11 new CareCredit specialties. And earlier this year we acquired Loop Commerce, a technology leader in digital and in-store gifting services, which brought into our product line and technology capabilities.","Overall, it was also a breakout year for technology. Our investments over the past four years are increasingly contributing to our success. Data analytics, AI, the cloud and others are now credit and customer service innovation and new digital and mobile customer experiences. Looking ahead, we continue to have a strong growth trajectory and we will continue to pursue partnerships on economic terms that meet our risk-adjusted return threshold.","I will now turn the call over to Brian to detail our financial results and our outlook for 2019.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $783 million or $1.09 per diluted share. Loan receivables were up 14% and interest and fees on loan receivables were up 13% over last year, reflecting the addition of the PayPal Credit portfolio in the third quarter. We also continued to deliver solid organic growth. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business as well as the risk-adjusted returns on this growth.","The interest and fee income growth were driven primarily by the growth in receivables. Purchase volume grew 10% over last year and average active account growth was 8%. The positive trends continued in average balances, with growth in average balance per average active account, up 5% compared to last year.","RSAs increased $76 million, or 10%, from last year in line with receivable growth. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.8% for the quarter compared to 3.9% last year. The provision for loan losses increased $98 million or 7% from last year, driven by the PayPal Credit reserve build, partially offset by moderating credit trends. The reserve build in the quarter was $204 million, in line with our expectation of $200 million to $250 million. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation.","Other income was up $2 million, while interchange was up $14 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our dual card. This was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $15 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange in loyalty expense went back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.","We expect loyalty program expenses as a percent of interchange revenue to continue to trend near 100% with some quarterly fluctuation. Other expenses increased to $108 million or 11% versus last year, driven primarily by expenses related to the addition of the PayPal Credit program and business growth. The expense growth rate will continue to be impacted by the addition of the PayPal program until we are comparing against quarters with PayPal on the run rate.","We will also continue to make strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities and investments to automate and streamline the back office. So overall, the company generated strong performance for the fourth quarter, especially considering the reserve build related to adding the PayPal Credit portfolio.","I'll move to slide seven, and cover our net interest income and margin trend. Net interest income was up 11%, driven primarily by the addition of the PayPal portfolio and loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.06% compared to last year's margin of 16.24%. The margin was mainly in line with our expectations.","We benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we deployed excess liquidity to support the PayPal portfolio acquisition and receivables growth. Also impacting the margin was a decline in the loan receivables yield and an increase in interest bearing liability cost.","The loan receivables yield was 21.2%, a decline of 23 basis points versus last year, mainly due to the impact of adding the PayPal portfolio. The increase in total interest bearing liabilities cost was up 52 basis points to 2.48% reflecting higher benchmark rates. We will cover our expectations for the margin going forward in our 2019 outlook later.","Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 4.76% compared to 4.67% last year and the 90 plus delinquency rate was 2.29% versus 2.28% last year. The year-over-year trends in both the 30 plus and 90 plus delinquency rates were relatively stable for the third quarter in a row.","If you exclude the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio, the 30 plus delinquency rate improved by approximately 15 basis points and the 90 plus delinquency rate improved by approximately five basis points compared to the prior year, reflecting the impact of our underwriting refinements and a more modest impact from normalization.","Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.54% compared to 5.78% last year and in line with our expectations. While the net charge-off rate benefited from the purchase accounting impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit portfolio, the credit trends in the core portfolio also continued to improve.","Excluding the PayPal Credit portfolio impact, the net charge-off rate was down by approximately 10 basis points compared to last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.9% and the reserve build from the third quarter was $204 million.","As I noted earlier, the reserve build was in line with our expectations due to the improving credit trends, resulting from the underwriting refinements we made. These underwriting refinements continued to drive changes to our purchase volume mix by FICO score.","If you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification, excluding the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio, we continued to grow at a fairly strong pace in accounts with a FICO score of 7.21 or higher, which increased 7% over the same quarter last year.","While purchase volume for accounts with FICO scores of 6.60 and below declined 9%, reflecting some of the modest tightening we've been doing. These trends helped inform our view of loss expectations for this year and beyond.","In summary, the core credit trends have leveled off and are showing improvement in line with our expectations and we expect the core trends to continue to show stability as we move forward assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns. Later I\u2019ll provide our outlook on credit expectations for the upcoming year.","Moving to slide nine, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $1.1 billion, up 11% over last year and were primarily driven by the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program and growth. The efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter versus 30.3% last year and in line with our expectations. The increase was primarily driven by the timing of strategic investments.","Moving to slide 10, the key highlights are, we have maintained our funding mix and strong capital and liquidity levels while on-boarding the PayPal portfolio. We also made progresses here in deploying capital through growth and by executing the capital plan we announced last May, which increased our dividends and the size of our share repurchases through June of 2019. We are committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet with a robust capital and liquidity profile.","Over the last year we've grown our deposits over $7.5 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 73% of our funding, maintaining the level we have been operating at over the last year.","We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital capabilities. Longer term, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers.","Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 14% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rule. This compares to 15.8% on a fully phased-in basis last year, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio and continued execution of our capital plan.","During the quarter, we continued to execute on the capital plan we announced last May, by paying a common stock dividend of $0.21 per share. After repurchasing nearly 1 billion of common stock during the third quarter, we did not repurchase stock during the fourth quarter, as we are out of the market pending developments around Walmart and the number of significant renewals we announced.","We've approximately 1 billion remaining in potential share repurchases of the 2.2 billion, our Board authorized through the fourth quarters ending June 30, 2019. We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plans subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.","Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $19 billion, which equated to 18% of our total assets. This is down from 22% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity to support the PayPal portfolio acquisition.","Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We are committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels. And we expect to continue deploying capitals through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Next on slide 11, I'll quickly recap our 2018 performance compared to the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables, our growth of 14% was in line with our outlook range of 13% to 15% including the PayPal Credit portfolio. The growth continued to be driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering solid organic growth.","Our continued investments in mobile, innovation and data analytics capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth as well as win new programs. Moderately tempering some of the growth was the impact from the underwriting refinements we began to implement in the second half of 2016.","Net interest margin was 15.97% for the year at the higher end of the 15.75% to 16% range we provided back in January. A more optimal asset and funding mix along with some benefits from a lower than expected deposit rate data were the major drivers of the performance.","RSAs as a percent of average receivables came in lower than our outlook last January. RSAs came in at 3.7% versus the original outlook of 4.2% to 4.4%. The lower RSA percent was mainly driven by a modest reduction in yield given improving delinquency trends. The elimination of the RSA payment on Toys\"R\"Us and portfolio mix. This demonstrates the countercyclical nature of the RSAs.","Our net charge-off rate of 5.63% was in line with our outlook of 5.5% to 5.8% range for the year. Net charge-offs continue to normalize the degree off the very favorable levels in 2015 and 2016, and as expected, the trends stabilized in the second half of this year.","We also saw reserve builds declined from over $1.2 billion in 2017 to near $850 million in 2018, as expected. The efficiency ratio for the year was 30.8% also in line with our expectations. We continued to drive operating leverage to higher margins, revenue growth and increased productivity.","And lastly, we generated return on assets of 2.8% versus expectations of around 2.5% due to the factors I just noted.","Moving to our 2019 outlook on slide 12. Our macro assumptions for 2019 assume the FET continues to tighten this year and the unemployment rate is mainly stable. We are providing the 2019 outlook including the impact of the Walmart portfolio sale expected to occur later in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter this year. I will also provide some details around other impacts the portfolio sale will have on the reserve and capital deployment.","Our outlook for core receivables growth, excluding the impact of the Walmart portfolio sale, is in the 5% to 7% range. The growth rate takes into account strong growth we are seeing from e-commerce and digital and that the impact from the underwriting refinements is now reflected in the ongoing run rate. This also assumes economic trends continue. We expect to grow sales volume at 2 to 3 times broader retail sales and for e-commerce and digital to continue its strong growth.","We believe our margin will continue to run in the 15.75% to 16% range this year with the normal seasonality we see quarter-to-quarter. While the 2019 margin, when compared to 2018, will benefit from the PayPal pre-funding impact not repeating in higher benchmark rates, this will be largely offset by a slightly lower revolve rate, as well as excess liquidity for a short period of time due to the Walmart portfolio sale.","We expect that RSAs as a percentage of average receivables will trend closer to the 4% to 4.2% range for 2019. The single largest driver of the expected increase in the RSA outlook is the sale of the Walmart portfolio which operates at a lower RSA percentage than our overall rate. The outlook is more in line with our historical run rate and, aside from the Walmart portfolio sale impact, reflects continued strong performance of our programs.","The good news here is that we're able to renew and extend five of our largest ongoing programs, beginning with PayPal, Lowe's, JCPenney, Amazon and Sam's Club while maintaining the RSA as a percent of average receivables in line with the historical average for the company and at attractive risk-adjusted returns.","In terms of credit, we expect net charge-offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with a slight increase entirely driven by the impacts from the PayPal Credit portfolio, partially offset by the sale of the Walmart portfolio. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Walmart, the net charge-off rate is expected to be flat to 2018.","Looking at seasonality in net charge-offs, we typically see the NCO rate trend higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter due to the seasonal decline in receivables. While the increase has historically been in the 40 to 70 basis point range, we expect it may trend towards the higher end of this range given the decline purchase accounting benefit from the PayPal Credit portfolio.","Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds will continue to transition to more growth-driven builds and less from normalization. We will also see some impact due to the remaining reserve build on the PayPal Credit program. Our expectation is that reserve builds for the first quarter of 2019 will be similar to what we saw in the fourth quarter around $200 million. This would exclude any reserve impact from the sale of the Walmart portfolio which I will get to shortly.","Moving to the efficiency ratio for 2019. We expect to continue to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of approximately 31% similar to 2018. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will partly offset by continued spend on strategic investments we feel are important to the business. Regarding Walmart's impact on the efficiency ratio, we are executing cost actions that will offset the revenue impact from the portfolio of being sold.","Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry, and we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. Finally, consistent with our track record, we expect to generate a return on assets of 2.5% or greater in 2019.","Before I conclude, I wanted to provide some additional information on the impacts from the Walmart portfolio of sale. Given we now have an agreement to sell the portfolio it will be moved to loans held for sale in the first quarter.","Our future expected losses in the portfolio will be limited to the remaining time we have it and in the first quarter we will be releasing reserves in the range of approximately $500 million based on the expected sale date. This begins to free up part of the capital related to the Walmart portfolio that we communicated earlier.","Beyond the first quarter, additional capital will be freed up from future reserve releases on the portfolio and ultimately the sale of the portfolio later this year. We expect the size of the portfolio will be approximately $9 billion at the time of the sale.","The capital freed up will be deployed through share repurchases and\/or higher returning alternatives. Overall, we continue to believe the combination of capital deployment and cost savings will result in the replacement of the EPS the program was generating.","And with that I'll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a recap of our strategic priorities, the continued focus of our assets to drive value to our partners, cardholders and shareholders. A top priority remains to execute successfully across our three platforms, building upon our capabilities in marketing, analytics, loyalty and digital and mobile technology.","We still have a lot of room to grow organically and we will focus on driving that organic growth, but also evaluating potential new programs with appropriate risk-adjusted returns.","We will continue to make investments to expand the utility of our cards and innovate with our partners to create attractive value proposition and drive card usage. We will continue to invest in next-generation data analytics and technology offering. Digital and mobile technologies remained a key focus as these channels become increasingly popular.","We will further develop frictionless customer experiences in a digitized environment through the use of customer journey and size. We are also focused on leveraging alternative data and machine learning to further drive innovation, advanced underwriting and authentication.","Our banking platform remains an important funding source. And as such, we will continue to broaden our products and capabilities to help increase loyalty, diversify funding and drive profitability. We will also continue to explore opportunities to expand and diversify the business in areas like health care finance, small business and proprietary networks.","It remains a key priority to operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We have proven our ability to do this and it will remain a top priority for us in the future. We expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operation, business growth, credit rating and regulatory targets.","Finally, we will continue to utilize our strong capital position to support growth, which are in capital through dividends and share purchases and M&A and continued investments that support our business objectives and capabilities. We believe we are well-positioned for long-term growth and we look forward to driving results for our partner\u2019s, cardholders and shareholders in 2019.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks and congratulations on a whole bunch of things that you announced. Maybe Margaret, you could just summarize, because I think there's been some debate over the last few months about the level of expertise from an e-commerce standpoint. And I've been impressed actually with the partners that you've renewed and the partners that you've added. And can you just talk about the contribution that that makes to your growth rate? And what it means for additional partnerships that you've been able to add?","Margaret Keane","Yeah. Thank you. Thank you, Moshe. I think that all of you know that we've been working really hard to continue to enhance our digital capabilities, and we've been focusing both on the digital side as well as analytics. And I think if you see some of the names and partners that we've been also with or win over the last 12 months, you can see we're certainly winning in the digital space whether it\u2019s Amazon, PayPal, eBay, LazMall, zulily.","We're winning in the space and I think if we look at our overall performance, our year-over-year mobile growth totaled 39% and 52% with PayPal in the fourth quarter. U.S. growth is about 16%. Our online sales for retail card penetration was 35%. And our apps, actual apps occurring digitally are up 45%, 49% with PayPal in the fourth quarter.","And the last piece, I'd add is, we've talked about SyPi is -- which is really the whole plug-in that we do with our partners where you don't really meet their site through actually ending partners application. We have that out there with 21 brands and partners right now. We just hit over 1 billion in credit card payments in that application.","So our view is we have a soup to nuts capabilities from applying and buying to a digital card, to getting your loyalty rewards, to then servicing your account within the apps. So our perspective is we certainly have the capability and continue to enhance that capability. Probably the biggest enhancement now is taking all that digital capability and enhancing it with data and customer journeys as we continue to make each experience frictionless.","Moshe Orenbuch","Okay. Thanks. And a follow-up question, Brian, you talked about having $1 billion remaining and then the $500 million that is now available as of the reserve release. Could you talk a little bit about perhaps the cadence of how you would deploy that and whether it's buyback or other alternatives?","Brian Doubles","Yeah, sure, Moshe. So, look now that we have clarity around the portfolio being sold, we'll start to free up the capital that's allocated to portfolio. As we said earlier, we still believe the transaction allows us to offset the EPS impact to Walmart. It's accretive relative to our renewal.","And so I think in terms of timing, if I just take you through the year, we indicated that in the first quarter we\u2019ll move the portfolio that held for sale will only retain reserves for the period that we\u2019re holding the assets. So you'll see a fairly significant reserve release in the first quarter. That should be around $500 million.","And then you'll see subsequent reserve releases in the second quarter and third quarter, somewhere in the range of $200 million to $250 million in each quarter. And so that steps you through the reserve releases and what to expect there. And then, obviously, we expect to sell the assets late third quarter, early fourth quarter. And that's when we'll free up the additional capital that's allocated to the portfolio.","So that gives you a sense of the cadence on the capital release in terms of the timing on deployments. We\u2019re, obviously, in discussions with the regulators on our board on how to go about that and timing and when we have more to share there. We'll, obviously, share it with all of you.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Thanks very much.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. We have our next question from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Thanks very much. Real quick I guess clarification, Brian. You mentioned a $200 million reserve build in Q1, but then separate from that, you've got a release from Walmart. Are we -- the distinguished -- the Walmart portfolio at this point given that its going -- it won't held for sale from call it the core portfolio? Or how do we think about that basis there?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. I would take it in those two pieces, John. So I would take in the first quarter, we expect the reserve build for the core portfolio plus the remaining build related to PayPal. We're still working our way through that. We think that is a $200 million approximate build in the first quarter. And then you'll see approximately $500 million release in the first quarter related to Walmart. So you have those net $300 million release in the first quarter.","John Hecht","Okay, thanks. And then, you guys have really worked through a lot of the partnerships extended brought out new partnerships. Margaret, I'm wondering, can you tell us has there been any changes in the structural components of the contracts? Or is it largely like it's been the last several years?","Margaret Keane","It's largely the same. I think, if you look at the overall plan for 2019, you could see the RSA's and our overall return for the business returns remains the same. So, we're just really pleased about how the quarter ended and how we actually successfully want to renew throughout 2018. We had 50 renewals overall -- for the overall business and we're really confident.","I think one of the things that we've continually said is we're going to renew deals that work for us and that are important to us. And that we have high-level engagement from our partners where we feel we can really grow. And I think everyone that we've been able to renew and win our partners that fit that description.","John Hecht","Wonderful. Thanks very much guys.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning, and congrats on all these developments. I guess first question is with all these extensions and renewals, should we assume that any appreciable concentration has been pushed out five years now?","Brian Doubles","Sanjay, you're talking about the terms of the agreements?","Sanjay Sakhrani","Yeah. I'm just saying like as far as like any significant renewal you might have going forward in terms of the concentration? Is it fair to assume now we're four, five years away from anything significant?","Brian Doubles","Well, look, I think when you assume, obviously, these are all confidential agreements, but in each case for the large renewals, these are multi-year agreements, multiyear extensions from the last contractual date. And I think that gives you some indication that in all cases this gives us fairly significant amount of time to get in there, drive growth, drive penetration with these partners. So very good extensions in all cases, really attractive financial profile, good returns.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. And then I guess a follow-up question for Margaret. I'm curious what you think led to a different outcome on Sam's Club versus Walmart? I know the product and the value props were different, but I mean did they feel just differently about the value you provided versus Walmart? Maybe you could just talk about that a little bit? Thanks.","Margaret Keane","Yeah. I think part of it is really the importance of the credit card program. I think to the Sam's Club, it's a little different than the percentage penetration we had in Walmart. So I think from a member perspective, the card's a big part of Sam's Club sales. So I think that's an important element.","I think the other is, and I've said this all along, it's really two separate teams. We have always had a decent relationship with Sam's Club. And I think we leveraged our capabilities and the things we're building to win that relationship. I think one of the things we've talked about throughout this process is how -- this isn't always easy, how important it is for us to continue to deliver for both Walmart and Sam's throughout this transition?","And I think as we went through the holiday, we made sure we delivered great customer service to both parties and I think that's how you win in the space. It's really about how you deliver for the partner. And I think we've been able to come out of this in a really good way and we are looking really forward to really continuing our partnership with Sam and helping them grow their sales and extend their membership. I mean, that's what's really important here.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Right. Congrats again.","Margaret Keane","Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","And we have our next question from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","So Brian, just to clarify the Walmart portfolio, was there a gain or sale or was it more sort of at par? And then, I guess, essentially what you're saying is, you're sort of reiterating this $2.5 billion of freed up capital, maybe adjusted a little bit by the portfolio size, but essentially no change there. You walk through the reserve, if you could kind of comment on that.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So, look, in terms of the first question, I can't be too specific on the terms, but I will highlight that our ability to replace the EPS didn't hinge on getting a gain on the portfolio. So the capital released from our perspective was really coming from the reserves and the capital that\u2019s allocated to the portfolio. So now that we have clarity on the portfolio sale and the timing, we still believe the transaction allows us to offset the EPS. Other than that, I can't be too specific.","And I gave you -- in terms of the capital, I gave you pretty clear walk on the reserves. The portfolio is approximately $9 billion at the time of sale. When we made our first announcement, it was closer to $10 billion. So we do expect a little bit of attrition between now and then, just given some scaling because of marketing funds and things like that between now and close. But I think that\u2019s real.","Don Fandetti","The other clarification, I thought last quarter you had mentioned that you thought the loan yield might be down potentially 50 to 60 basis points quarter-over-quarter, but it looks like it was up. Can you talk about that?","Brian Doubles","The loan yield, just in general?","Don Fandetti","Yes. I mean, I thought it was going to be down a little bit more. I could have that wrong, but it seems like it came in a little bit better.","Brian Doubles","Yes. So what we said that, net interest margin in total would be kind of in that 16% range for the second half of the year and it came in right in line with that. If you look at just the receivable yield, that was down 23 basis points compared to the prior year. And that was entirely driven by the PayPal portfolio. So if you exclude the effects of PayPal, the core yield would have been up approximately 10 bps compared to the prior year, so pretty consistent.","Don Fandetti","Okay.","Brian Doubles","I think, any other noise quarter-to-quarter is probably just normal seasonality, Don.","Don Fandetti","Okay, got it.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. Brian, you'd made the comment that long term the expectation is that the deposits will grow in line with receivables growth. I'm curious what the funding mix is going to look like this year. Will you pay down some debt, or will we actually just see a build in the investment securities until the proceeds are redeployed?","Brian Doubles","Yes, Rick. Look I think in terms of our funding plans for 2018, I would expect them to be largely consistent with where we\u2019ve trended over the last couple of years. Our target ranges are for deposits to be 70% to 75% of the funding, secure to be 15% to 20%, unsecured to be 10% to 15%. I don't see anything as I think about 2019 that really changes that profile in a material way. Now, obviously, we're opportunistic in terms of when to go a little bit heavier on one of those funding sources than others. But, overall, I think that's the target range that we're pretty comfortable with. And you'll see that for most of 2019.","The only other thing I would highlight is we're going to be very careful around how we manage liquidity in advance of the Walmart portfolio sales. So we will have to carry some excess liquidity after that sale happens, but we'll look to minimize that as best as we can and we\u2019ll do that through all three of those funding sources.","Rick Shane","Got it. And again, look obviously, the deposit funding is very important part of the long-term strategy and I guess, I'm curious, how easy if you turn on and off as you sort of approach this event call lead to Q3 and then ramp it up going forward?","Brian Doubles","Yes. It's actually fairly easy. And look that's good and bad. I mean, we're steel fairly rate sensitive in the deposit book. And so if we lack the market significantly for a period of time then we'll be able to manage the deposit inflow and the maturities in a way that helps us minimize the excess liquidity that we carry after the Walmart portfolio transitions. So I think it's pretty manageable. You can negate it entirely, but it's certainly something we'll be focused on and it's pretty manageable from our perspective.","Rick Shane","Great. Really appreciate the color. Thanks, guys.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","I wondered if you could give us some color as to how the PayPal portfolio is going relative to expectations and as well as a give some color around, how you're thinking about the reserving for that? I know you gave us 1Q, but may be can you give us a sense as to the forward look for the full year coming from them?","Margaret Keane","Sure. I'll start out. First, our partnership is really just fantastic. We have such a high level of engagement between us and PayPal. I think maybe some of you saw the announcements as we are working with PayPal to help deferred load in employees of the federal government, we did that in like 24 hours. And to get that kind of level of engagement in terms of how to service their customers and how to grow the program is just fantastic. So we're fully, fully aligned.","The program is operating the way we thought it would. And I think we're just really excited about the overall growth potential as we continue to look at areas of opportunity together for growth. Obviously, we have work to do you to kind of bring the full portfolio on, but we're very focused on delivering for that. And we're just overall really pleased with our partnership and I couldn't be happy about how the program is performing. Brian, on the reserves.","Brian Doubles","Yeah. So, Betsy, on the reserves, we ended the quarter with a $204 million build. We think the first quarter looks very similar in terms of the range and that includes both the reserve build for PayPal as well as the core reserve build.","So, we're not going to break out PayPal anymore going forward, but what we'll do is step that out for you as we get through the year, kind of, one quarter at a time. So, we think the PayPal reserve build based on the purchase accounting, that's largely complete by the end of the second quarter, maybe a little bit addressed in the third quarter. But we think $200 million range for the first quarter then in April; we\u2019ll give you a sense for what we think in the second quarter.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. And then on the buybacks, is there any opportunity for you to accelerate that with the Walmart sale, I think the back book sale that you're doing, is there any kind of forward purchase that you can do? I'm just trying to think through, if that's feasible for you?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Look, it's harder for us to be too specific in terms of timing versus relatively fresh agreement. We now have certainty around timing and other things and we\u2019re in conversions with our board and our regulators about how and when we can deploy that capital.","So, I can't be much more specific than that other than, our goal is to deploy it as it\u2019s being freed up, assuming that more in line with all of our capital targets and the board and the regulators are comfortable. So, when we have more to announce, we'll certainly announce it.","Betsy Graseck","Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yeah, thanks. Could you discuss a little more about where we should expect some of the expenses to come out as you manage to a relatively flat efficiency ratio with the Walmart revenues going away?","Brian Doubles","Yes. So, look, first I'd say that we have very detailed plans that we're going to begin executing and have already started to execute this year to get that done. Some of the cost actions will actually happen in advance of the program moving.","So, there are some costs that are not directly tied to the program. But I would think about Mark, the majority of the cost actions will be completed as soon as possible after the portfolio is sold.","And one of the things that we're, obviously, very focused on as Margaret said is not affecting the performance of the program, making sure we ensure a seamless transition on our part. And so a lot of those cause remain in place until the portfolio transfers.","But we do feel like we've got a really good plan in place to offset any impact on the efficiency ratio. We don't expect there to be any impact on our operating leverage. But you'll really see the full benefits of those cost actions in 2020. That will be our first year without the program.","Mark DeVries","Got it. And then on the Amazon renewal, were you able to make any changes to the agreement there that may improve your position in relative to chase like better geography on the website for advertising or acceptance that hold through?","Margaret Keane","Yeah, look, Mark what I would say there is we can't provide any specifics on any of our individual agreements. But as we've said in the past, whenever you do these renewals, you typically move around the economics, you look for ways to drive further alignment between us and the partner, you find ways to drive more growth.","And in the case of all of our renewals, we've been able to achieve an attractive financial profile. I think in all cases, we have better alignment with the partner under to go-forward agreement and so we feel really good about what we did with Amazon, but in the case of all the renewals.","Mark DeVries","Okay, thanks.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research.","Matthew O'Neill","Yeah, hi, thanks for taking my question. Understand that you're not going to provide specific sort of confidential terms on the Sam\u2019s renewable. I was wondering if you could maybe just kind of give us directionally an idea, was it more of just a push out of the existing contract, or was it really back to the table open book negotiation with a longer potential duration to the renewal?","Margaret Keane","Well, you know, look, in all these cases, these are good negotiations. So we had a good negotiation with our friends at Sam's. We feel really good about the outcome. And I think, as Brian said, this is a multiyear agreement, an extension from when that program was supposed to end. So, for us, I think -- look I think the most positive thing is we've been able to renew Sam's, resolve where the Walmart book is going. And not have the loss sitting over our head. So the overall results of where we ended is, really great for the company. We're very confident that we'll continue to serve Sam's Club really well and help them grow which is what we do. And I think we did all this in the fourth quarter and we delivered in the fourth quarter for our partners. So we feel good and we're very happy about where we landed with the agreement with Walmart and Sam's Club.","Matthew O'Neill","Thanks. And maybe just as a quick follow-up to that. From a higher level, obviously, a huge numbers of renewables on a lot of large partners and impressive outcome with respect to the 2019 guidance maintaining the 2.5 ROA, just curious, in these discussions was it in part motivated by serve an adjustment to the terms as far as on ROA and the share growth with respect to the tax reform? Or were there any other kind of consistent changes throughout the renewables, or was it really just kind of the duration was up. It was time to come back to the table and generally speaking not material changes and similar ROA outlook?","Brian Doubles","Yeah, look, I would say that every one of these is very unique. In some cases, you are moving around some terms, in some cases you're moving around the value prop or the marketing funds to benefit the consumer and drive growth, in some cases, you're tweaking the RSA or the marketing funds. I mean there's just so many different things inside of these agreements so you can move based on what the partner wants and what we want to achieve.","I'd say in all cases where we have moved around economics, we do it in a way historically that has benefited the consumer frankly and has \u2013 we\u2019ve put dollars to work to drive growth. As Margaret said in all cases, these renewals have a very attractive financial profile.","We gave you our 2019 outlook that includes the impact of all the renewals and you can see as you mentioned the RSA percentage and ROA percentage are right in line with the historical run rate. So you always move some things around in these to get both parties happy. But in all cases, we're able to get this done with a pretty attractive financial profile for us.","Matthew O'Neill","Got it. Thanks very much, guys.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Margaret Keane","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.","Jamie Friedman","Margaret, in your prepared remarks, you had called out something about Google. But I didn't see it on page three. I was just wondering if you could just revisit what you said there, it sounded important?","Margaret Keane","Yes. We renewed our partnership with Google. We actually financed their hardware, so Pixel and items that they sell on their website. So that was an extension we did as well in our fourth quarter. So that's kind of what I said in the prepared remarks.","Jamie Friedman","Okay. And then also in your answer to the first question, you gave some of those technology related metrics that you frequently share. I was wondering if you could repeat those, you were going kind of quick there?","Margaret Keane","Yes, sure. So our year-over-year mobile growth totaled 39%, 52% with PayPal in the fourth quarter. So we continue to see really good traction. I think two things. One is, the additional capabilities we continue to build as we try to make that whole mobile experience wing to wing friction less.","But I think the other is, consumers more and more are on their tablets or on their phones in terms of how they're shopping. So that was I think a big move for us. Our online sales, actually sales on our cards online for retail card was 35%. So that continues to grow as well in the fourth quarter.","And then, in terms of acquiring new accounts, applications, we're now up to 45% of our apps occurring digitally. If you add PayPal in there in the fourth quarter, it was 49%. And then lastly, we integrated SyPi into 21 of our partners and brands. And that particular SyPi capability allows you to really service your card seamlessly with any app of the retailers, so you never have to leave. And we hit a $1 billion in card payments last year.","So we're continuing to see very good traction in terms of the capabilities that we're building out. We worked very closely with our partners as they are looking at their digital roadmap. And we're trying to align with them and deliver every quarter on the needs for those particular partners. So again, really excited about what we've been able to build. And there's a lot -- still lots of opportunity to grow on the digital roadmap, and partnerships with our customers.","Jamie Friedman","Thank you very much.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Chris Brendler with the Buckingham.","Chris Brendler","Hi. Thanks, and congratulations as well. I had a question on PayPal acquisition. And sort of how it's trending, it's kind of hard to see exactly what's going on. But Brain, I think you called out some NIM or yield pressure related to PayPal. And also, just if you can give us a sense of the growth profile on the ROA at this point. It doesn\u2019t quite seem like with delinquencies building and the yield coming down a little bit, I'm not sure how to think about the return profile of the PayPal transaction at this point. Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So look, we -- I guess, what I would say is, the portfolio or the program is trending exactly in line with our expectations. We knew that there would be a little bit of noise in some of the metrics in 2018. As we indicated, you go to work through that reserve build, the upfront reserve build on the portfolio. We still expect the program to be accretive in 2019, no change to what we said earlier.","The impact on yield is really just driven by the fact that the PayPal portfolio itself runs at a lower yield on our overall book. We did make some pricing changes that will start to bleed in over the course of 2019 into 2020. That will offset some of that, but you're really just saying the fact that the PayPal portfolio, given where it's priced, runs at a lower yield than the overall portfolio. And so that drove some of what you're seeing on net interest margin and yield in the quarter.","And then, what you're seeing on some of the credit metrics is just the working through the rest of the purchase accounting. So that's largely done this quarter. As we've indicated in the past, the PayPal portfolio will put some upward bias on the net charge-off rate into 2019. We highlighted that as part of our outlook. So if you think about net charge-offs in that 5.7% to 5.9% range that includes PayPal, it includes the partial offset for Walmart.","And if you exclude both of those impacts, the core net charge-off rate is flat. So, we try to get you a pretty good indication of where PayPal is influencing those metrics, but I would say generally the program, the portfolio is trending right in line with our expectations.","Chris Brendler","That's helpful. Thanks. And a separate question. You mentioned, Toys\"R\"Us having, I think a benefit on retailers sharing this quarter. And just sort of studying back since that bankruptcy occurred in 2018, we potentially could have more retail bankruptcies in your portfolio in the future.","Is that a glitch from an earnings-neutral event to think in this case Toys\"R\"Us, like is this test case suggests that we shouldn't worry too much about retailers too much along the future? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Look our goal is to always try and keep it earnings neutral. Toys\"R\"Us a good example, gives you an indication of the options that we have, when that happens to one of our partners. So in that case, we took those account holders. We converted into a Synchrony branded general-purpose card. We stopped paying the RSA, as we indicated and we use those additional dollars to fund a very attractive value prop. So that's certainly our goal. And we do have options to help mitigate the impact in those cases.","Chris Brendler","Great. Thanks so much.","Greg Ketron","With that, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you, sir. Our last question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. I had a couple of quick ones. First, on your loan growth guidance, what was the balance of the Walmart loans at the end of 2018? I want to make sure that we're looking at the correct point or period and 2018 base for the guide?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. I mean, Bill, I can't give it to you specifically. But we indicated it was 10 billion, expected to be 9 billion when we close, so it's somewhere in between. That's probably as close as I can get you.","Bill Carcache","Okay. And then last just question on tail risk under the agreement. Can you give us a sense of whether we should expect any impact? I understand that the terms of the agreement are tough financial, but should we expect or what kind of impact if any, should we expect -- the impact of the Walmart portfolio to have on your results post sales, if any?","Brian Doubles","It will have no impact on our results post sales. This is a complete transfer of the portfolio. We are retaining no risk. There is no ongoing sharing. There is no law support. There is nothing. This is a very standard clean transaction. So, when it closes, it's closed.","Bill Carcache","Okay. So it's reasonable then to conclude that essentially the three parties for the transactions; yourself, Capital One and Walmart, Capital One's indication last night that its losses are limited, which suggest then that Walmart is playing a role in absorbing losses beyond a certain amount, but not to you guys.","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Look, I can't comment on the agreement between the other two parties. What I can tell you is that our side of this is pretty clean from that perspective, very standard transfer of the portfolio, very market. We're not retaining any risk.","Bill Carcache","Understood. Thank you very much. Congratulations.","Brian Doubles","Thank you.","Greg Ketron","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day.","Operator","And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. We thank you for participating.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our fourth quarter earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us this morning.","In addition to today's press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our Web site, synchronyfinancial.com.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to join us today.","I'll start on Slide 3, but before I cover those slides, I will begin with a review of our 2014 accomplishments. After I provide a fourth quarter summary, I will then turn the call over to Brian to provide more details on our results and review our 2015 outlook.","2014 was a hallmark year for Synchrony Financial with many milestones to mark our progress. One of the highlights of the year, as you are all aware, was our launch as a new public company, a large step toward our eventual separation from GE. Also, in preparation to be a standalone public company, we successfully added infrastructure to a number of key functional areas and operations to support our future standalone capabilities. This includes important capabilities such as our new data centers that have been certified and are fully operational. We are now in the process of converting our applications and IT infrastructure.","And while achieving separation is of great importance to the future of Synchrony, we have also stayed focused on our business objectives. We have extended a significant number of our largest programs, extending our partnerships has been a key priority and we have lots of success here. We have been capitalizing on new business opportunities signing on several new partners across all three of our platforms.","To better serve our partners and cardholders, we continue to enhance our existing offerings and invest in new strategies with a focus on innovation and mobile payment technologies. We are pursuing a wallet strategy that is partner and consumer-led. Our approach is to build, partner and invest in the development of payment services that embrace the latest technologies from across the industry to benefit our customers and partners.","For example, we have a mobile platform that today allows customers to apply and buy, service their account and receive rewards on their mobile device. To further enhance our payment strategies, we are in discussions with key players, testing emerging technologies and piloting proprietary mobile payment applications as part of our roadmap to developing long-term successful mobile payment solutions. While developing this capabilities, we are maintaining the value proposition of our cards through the mobile payment process.","Last October, we signed up to participate in the Apple Pay program for our Dual Cards, putting us in a position to place participating Dual Cards into the Apple Pay wallet and we continue to progress on this front for rollout later this year. And as we noted last quarter, we continue to work with our strategic partners such as LoopPay to enhance our capabilities and provide options to our customers of mobile payments.","We are also working with MCX in deploying their CurrentC app for some of our partners. We are also forging partnerships with leaders in the mobile space to further enhance our capabilities. Most recently entering into a strategic partnership and investment with GPShopper, a leading, integrated, one-stop mobile commerce platform for retailers and brands. GPShopper builds integrated mobile apps and has significant retail expertise. Their mobile platform will enable us to launch mobile solutions with even richer features, including deeper credit integration across our whole partner base and facilitate the development of our mobile platforms for small to midsize partners. This will help drive an improved mobile shopping experience, greater customer loyalty and deeper engagement.","We also believe credit is increasingly important as customers' shopping behavior is moved to digital. Our ability to offer instant credit at the time of purchase whether in store or digitally makes Synchrony well-positioned to capitalize on these trends given our competitive strengths and scale. And we are seeing the results of these efforts materialize in a significant increase in online sales activity I will cover shortly.","Additionally, we launched EMV chip-enabled technology to enhance security on certain partners' Dual Cards and we are on track to have all Dual Cards chip-enabled by late 2015. Needless to say, we've had a lot underway and accomplished several key strategic priorities in 2014. From a performance standpoint, the overall fundamentals of the business remained strong throughout the year.","Speaking specifically to the fourth quarter performance as outlined on Slide 3, we reported diluted earnings per share of $0.64. During the quarter, purchase volume was up 11% with holiday sales supporting this strong growth. Receivables growth was up 7% over the same quarter last year and platform revenue increased a solid 9%.","As I noted, our focus on digital strategies has helped drive a significant increase in online purchase volume. For the fourth quarter, online purchase volume increased over 18% compared to the prior year. Asset quality improved with net charge-offs down 37 basis points and delinquencies down 21 basis points. We continued our strong deposit growth with deposits growing over $9 billion or 36% in 2014. Expenses were in line with our expectations. They were impacted by investments we made to help grow the business and support the build-out of our standalone infrastructure. Our balance sheet remained strong with Tier 1 common capital of 14.9% and liquidity of $13 billion at quarter end.","Moving to our business highlights, we recently announced a new agreement with BP that will be one of our 20 largest programs when we onboard them midyear. In addition, we extended our partnerships with Rooms To Go and Yamaha, all within our 40 largest programs. We added over 2,000 partners to our team and solutions platform and over 9,000 CareCredit provider locations since the fourth quarter of last year. I'll cover the performance of our three business platforms in a moment.","Lastly, as I outlined earlier, we have partnered with and made a strategic equity investment in GPShopper.","Moving to Slide 4 for a perspective on our key growth metrics, purchase volume for the quarter was $30 billion, an increase of 11% over last year. This helped drive receivables growth of 7% to $61 billion. Our average active accounts were up to $62 million, a 6% increase from last year and platform revenue was up 9% over the fourth quarter of last year. We did have a gain on portfolio sales in the quarter and excluding this, platform revenue growth was 7%. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continue to drive incremental growth through our value propositions and promotional financing offers.","On the next slide, I'll spend a few minutes discussing the performance with each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to give you more detail on our financial results.","Our three sales platforms, Retail Card, Payment Solutions and CareCredit continue to generate solid results. Retail Card, which is a leading provider of private label credit cards, also offers our proprietary Dual Cards. Dual Cards are co-branded, but differentiated as they have the capability to act as a private label card within the retailer's sales channel. Retail Card also offers small business products. Through our Retail Card platform, we partner with 19 national and regional retailers that collectively have over 33,000 locations across U.S. The addition of BP will bring us to 20 partners.","Retail Card accounts for nearly 70% of our receivables and platform revenue. Partner program performance was strong and broad based driving purchase volume growth of 12%, receivables growth of 6% and platform revenue growth of 7% excluding the gain on portfolio sales. Renewing and extending our programs has been a key priority in this business and we have been very successful here as I noted earlier. We now have nearly 90% of our Retail Card receivables under contract through 2018 and beyond.","Our longevity and dedication in the private label space for over 80 years is certainly helpful. The fact that this is our primary business, which we have been in for decades, is very important to our partners. It is also helping us win new programs, both existing and startup programs. We feel very good about the position we hold in this space and the partnerships we've developed and maintained.","Payment Solutions, which accounts for 20% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue, is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases primarily in the home furnishing, consumer electronics, jewelry, automotive and power products markets. We have 63,000 partners that collectively have over 119,000 locations. Purchase volume was up 10% and average active accounts were up 8% over last year driving receivables growth of 11% and platform revenue growth of 8%. The majority of our industries had positive year-over-year growth in both purchase volume and receivables. Performance was particularly strong in home furnishing, automotive products and power equipment. We extended our Rooms To Go and Yamaha partnerships and we are also actively pursuing a solid pipeline of potential new partnership opportunities as well.","CareCredit, which accounts for 11% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue, is a leading provider of financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures that include dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology services. The majority of our partners are individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers. The remainder are national and regional healthcare providers.","We service a broad network of over 156,000 providers with over 186,000 locations. The majority of our specialties showed year-over-year growth in both purchase volume and receivables with dental and veterinary turning the highest receivable growth. Purchase volume and average active accounts were both up 7% driving receivables and platform revenue growth of 5% over last year.","In sum, a strong quarter across each of our sales platforms as our focus on expanding and deepening our partnerships and programs yielded solid performance.","I'm now going to turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter.","Brian Doubles","Great, thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. The business earned $531 million of net income, which translates to $0.64 per diluted share on the quarter. Overall, as Margaret noted, the company delivered strong top-line growth with purchase volume up 11% and receivables up 7%.","Net interest income was up 5% compared to last year and this includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was raised to increase liquidity in the third quarter. The growth in interest income of 7% is in line with our receivables growth.","RSAs were up $36 million or 5% driven by growth in the programs. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.6% for the quarter and 4.5% for the year, consistent with 2013 and our expectations. The provision decreased $21 million or 3% compared to last year. There are a couple drivers here worth pointing out.","First, as you may recall in the fourth quarter of last year, there was an increase to the provision related to some enhancements to our reserve methodology, which did not repeat this quarter. Second, asset quality trends improved and charge-offs were lower year-over-year, which drove part of the decline. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.14%, down 21 basis points versus last year and the net charge-off rate was 4.32%, down 37 basis points versus last year. These items were largely offset by incremental provisions due to strong loan receivables growth.","Other income increased $32 million versus last year, largely driven by a $46 million gain related to portfolio sales in the quarter. Excluding the gain, other income was down $14 million driven by the following. Interchange was up $31 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spend on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $34 million primarily driven by the launch of new value propositions last quarter.","Debt cancellation fees of $67 million were consistent with prior quarters; however, they were down $21 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses decreased 2% as the prior year's quarter included charges related to certain regulatory matters. After adjusting for these charges, other expense increased due to three main drivers, which we discussed last quarter.","First, we're making investments to support ongoing growth, particularly in our Retail Card program. As many of you are aware, we recently completed long-term extensions with many of our large partners and as part of those renewals, we set aside more dollars in the marketing and growth funds to support those programs.","Second, we also launched our new branding campaign in September and continued our marketing efforts with a focus on our deposit products. And lastly, we continue to invest in the infrastructure build as we execute our plan to separate from GE.","So overall, the business had a good quarter. We had strong balance sheet growth and solid top-line growth generating an ROA of 2.7%.","Next, I'll move to Slide 7 and walk you through net interest income and our margin. Net interest income was up 5% driven by strong receivables growth, which was partially offset by higher funding costs. The net interest margin declined to 15.6%, which was in line with our expectations. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting.","The majority of the variance, approximately 300 basis points, was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio. We increased liquidity on the balance sheet to nearly $13 billion, which is up $11 billion versus last year. We have the cash conservatively invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the Fed, which results in lower yields than the rest of our earning assets.","The yield on our receivables declined 47 basis points as a result of slightly higher payment rates in the quarter and the impact of portfolio mix given the growth we're seeing in our promotional offers and payment solutions. Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.8%. Given the changes in our funding profile, I'll walk you through our breakdown by funding source.","First, the cost of our deposits was fairly stable, up 6 basis points to 1.6%. The increase was driven by extending the average tenor of our direct retail CDs, partially offset by strong growth in our lower rate savings account product.","Our deposit base increased over $9 billion year-over-year. We view this as a very attractive source of funds for us and we expect direct depositors to be a larger funding source going forward. Securitization funding costs increased 25 basis points to 1.5%. This was driven by extending some maturities in our Master Note Trust and the addition of $6 billion of undrawn securitization capacity.","Our other debt costs increased by 67 basis points to 2.7%, which is due to the higher rate on the GE Capital and bank loans, as well as the unsecured bond. It is worth noting here that the new bonds we issued are longer tenor, so we have replaced shorter-term variable rate funding for longer-dated fixed-rate funding. And this should benefit us in a rising rate environment.","Over the past two quarters, our margin has changed significantly due to the factors I just noted, the primary drivers of the liquidity build and the cost of the new funding sources we put in place after the IPO. As we enter 2015, the transition of our balance sheet is largely complete and we expect our margins to be relatively stable going forward. I'll cover this in more detail later in our 2015 outlook.","On Slide 8, I'll walk through some of our key credit metrics. Before I get to that, I thought it would be helpful to provide some perspective on the seasonal trends we see in the fourth quarter. We typically see receivables grow during the holiday season and you also see a corresponding increase to the allowance as well. However, the allowance coverage as a percentage of receivables typically comes down a bit in the fourth quarter just given a significant portion of the holiday balances pay down in the first quarter and don't translate into losses.","So overall, if you look at the trends in the third and fourth quarters last year compared to what we're seeing now, they are fairly consistent.","So turning more specifically to the fourth quarter results, as I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to slightly improving trends on asset quality, 30 plus delinquencies were 4.14%, down 21 basis points versus last year, 90 plus delinquencies were 1.9%, down 6 basis points. The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.32%, down 37 basis points after excluding the charge-offs associated with the non-core portfolio sale last year.","Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.28%, which is down 18 basis points from the prior quarter given the seasonal dynamic I mentioned above.","Another metric you can use to measure reserve coverage is to compare the reserve to the last 12 months of charge-offs. We're currently at 1.26x coverage, which equates to roughly 15 months of loss coverage on our reserve. This has been fairly consistent throughout 2014.","So overall, we feel good about the performance of our portfolio and our underwriting approach. And based on what we're seeing today, we think credit trends will continue to be stable.","Let me turn to Slide 9 and cover expenses. Overall expenses were in line with our expectations. Expenses did decline from the prior year, but the fourth quarter last year included $118 million in charges related to regulatory matters. Excluding these charges, expenses increased $103 million and were driven primarily by incremental investments in our programs and our brand, as well as the infrastructure we're building as part of our separation from GE.","So looking at the key expense line items for the quarter, employee costs were up $37 million as we added additional employees over the past year to support growth in the business and the infrastructure build as we prepare for separation.","Marketing and business development costs were up $48 million as we've increased investment in our programs, continued our marketing efforts around our deposit platform, as well as launching the new brand for the company. Other expenses were down $103 million, mainly due to the charges related to the regulatory matters I mentioned earlier.","So overall, our efficiency ratio was 32.4% for the quarter, which still indicates a very efficient operation compared against other financial institutions.","Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. So looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy is the continued growth of our deposit base. We view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by over $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program and this puts deposits at 56% of our funding. So we are well-positioned to meet our long-term target of being 60% to 70% deposit-funded.","Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable at around $15 billion or 24% of our funding. We did issue a little over $800 million of new securitization debt in the fourth quarter. Earlier in the year, we extended some of our maturities and added the undrawn capacity to further strengthen our liquidity.","Lastly, I want to walk through some recent developments related to our funding. So first, as we've said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility and GE Capital for funding. These are more expensive forms of financing for us and not part of our long-term funding strategy.","So on January 5th, we made a $1.8 billion prepayment on the bank and GE Capital loans and given this happened outside of the quarter, you don't see it reflected in the numbers, but the net effect is that the bank term loan facility decreased to $6.6 billion and the GE Capital loan decreased to $523 million. This is a positive result for the business given the bank term loan facility and the GE Capital loan carry higher spreads than our other funding sources.","So overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We'll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to prepay the bank and GE Capital loans.","So turning to capital, we ended the quarter at 14.9% Tier 1 common under Basel I. This level places us among the highest in our peer group. This translates to 14.5% common equity Tier 1 under the fully phased in Basel III guidance. The only other point I'd make regarding our capital levels is that consistent with prior communications, we do not plan to return capital through dividends or buybacks until we complete the separation from GE. So we do expect our capital levels will continue to increase during that time. And post-separation, we'd expect to begin returning capital in line with our peers.","So moving to liquidity, total liquidity increased to $19 billion and that's comprised of $12.9 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets.","So overall, we're executing on the strategy that we outlined as part of the IPO. We built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels.","Moving to Slide 11, I'll cover our outlook for 2015. Our macro assumptions for 2015 are consistent with the consensus views on forward rates on unemployment, our framework assumes the Fed beginning to tighten later this year and stable to slightly improving unemployment rate.","Our guidance for receivables growth is in the 6% to 8% range compared to the 5% plus we have communicated in the past. We believe a majority of the growth will be organic and we will continue to grow sales volume at two to three times the industries we operate in. This guidance includes our new relationship with BP, but doesn't assume any other new portfolio acquisitions.","We believe our margin will be in the 15% to 15.5% range this year compared to our prior guidance of near 15%. Aside from normal seasonality, we believe the receivables yield and funding costs will be relatively stable in 2015. If rates do increase later this year, we expect our neutral to slightly asset sensitive position would provide a small benefit to our net interest income.","In terms of our funding plan more broadly, we'll continue to grow our direct deposits and expect to achieve our target of 60% to 70% deposit funding in 2015. We will also continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets and we will use the proceeds to continue to pay down both the bank term loan and the GE Capital loan well in advance of the contractual maturity in 2019.","In terms of credit, given the view that unemployment will be stable to slightly improving throughout 2015 and our plan not to change our underwriting profile, we believe our credit metrics will continue to be stable, which is consistent with our prior guidance.","Our net charge-off ratio for the full year of 2014 was 4.5%. We tightened up our expectations on efficiency ratio from below 35% to below 34% as we have more visibility on 2015. This includes the incremental run rate costs associated with the separation, as well as the startup costs related to the BP program launch. We do expect to see some variation in this measure throughout 2015 driven by timing of the separation-related expenditures and some seasonality.","Finally, we continue to expect to generate a return on assets between 2.5% and 3% in 2015, which is consistent with earlier guidance and reflects the full impact of the changes to the funding profile and the balance sheet, as well as the separation costs.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I'll close with a summary of the quarter and our key priorities for 2015 on Slide 12 and then let Greg begin the Q&A portion of the call.","During the quarter, we exhibited strong broad based growth across several key areas. We signed a new agreement with BP and this will be one of our 20 largest programs. We also continued our success in extending a number of key partnerships and now have extended a large number of our relationships to 2018 and beyond.","Looking ahead to this year, our strategic priorities are focused on generating growth across all three of our platforms with our partner-focused business model bringing value through mobile, marketing, analytics and loyalty capabilities. We have attractive growth opportunities in several forms. There is also ample opportunity to better penetrate our existing programs and we have a healthy pipeline, which provides potential beyond our organic growth opportunity.","We will look to capitalize on opportunities to further leverage data analytics and mobile and e-capabilities as we continue to seek ways to provide even more value to our partners and consumers and stay at the forefront of emerging payment trends. We will continue executing on our direct deposit strategy continuing the substantial growth we have generated on the platform and driving our deposits to the target range of 60% to 70% of funding. And while we are focused on the strategies that drive our business, we will also be executing on our plans to separate from GE, including the filing of our application in the first half of this year and continuing the build-out of our standalone infrastructure.","As you can see by our 2015 outlook, we expect to continue to operate with a strong financial profile and balance sheet this year.","To conclude, we like our position and the prospects we have to leverage our deep expertise, solid foundation and track record of success with our distinctive market position. We are also very excited about the future of Synchrony Financial and look forward to continued progress towards our objectives.","This concludes our comments on the quarter, so I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session. As we do so, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you, good morning. Congrats on the BP portfolio win. I guess I was just wondering if you could just talk about the nature of the pipeline of new deals both in terms of size and pricing. Obviously, we're hearing that it's pretty competitive out there. And then I have got one follow-up.","Margaret Keane","Sure, Sanjay. It's Margaret. So I would say that overall we have a solid pipeline in all three of our platforms. As you mentioned, we won BP. The other positives, nearly 90% of our receivables in Retail Card are already locked up till 2018 and beyond. We added a bunch of new partners last year in Payment Solutions and CareCredit. So I would say the competitive environment is a little more competitive than we've seen over the last three years, but I think a couple of things.","I think one, our retailers and our partners are still looking for capabilities, people who are really going to come in and actually build their sales and help them build out their platforms and I think we have a key advantage there. I think the other thing is going through this process you really have to maintain discipline. We don't have to win every deal nor would we want to win every deal and I think you know this.","Our number one opportunity is still organic growth. So our biggest opportunity is to continue to grow with the portfolios we have. So I think we can be patient and we can be smart about which of these portfolios we really want to go after.","Sanjay Sakhrani","That makes sense. And then just my follow-up question is on the ROA trajectory. I guess there's some seasonality to that on a quarterly basis. Could you just walk us through that? Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure, Sanjay, this is Brian. So in terms of the seasonality and I guess I'd start with kind of where we ended in the fourth quarter. If you think about the first quarter and second quarter, I'd probably use the midpoint of the ROA guidance that we provided for 1Q and 2Q and then typically we see the ROA come up a bit in the third quarter and that's where we see the low point on charge-offs. That's been pretty consistent over time, so you see the ROA pick up a bit in the third quarter and then it comes down a bit in the fourth quarter and that's driven by just the higher marketing spend that we have, as well as some incremental provisions for the growth in the balance sheet. So that should give you a pretty good way to think about it for the year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Great, thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Margaret Keane","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","A couple of questions. One, could you update us on how you're thinking about how the MCX launch this year is going to play into your strengths and maybe a little bit about what you intend to do to capitalize on it?","Margaret Keane","Sure. So I think we've said before that we think mobile wallets are a key part of what we want to play in going forward. And our goal is really to be in as many wallets as we possibly can. And as you know, many of our partners are working with MCX, so our team is working with our partners, as well as MCX to be part of that platform.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And expectation is that's a midyear release?","Margaret Keane","I really can't comment on that. I think our team is still working through. I don't know if we have definitive dates, but I would say definitely within this year, you will see us in a couple of wallets and MCX would be one of them.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then follow-up question is just on the reserving outlook. I know there was a bit of a built here. I just wanted to understand given the fact that you're looking for stable NCOs next year, the reserve build is largely likely to be a function of loan growth. Is that an accurate assumption?","Brian Doubles","Yes. I think that's the way to think about it, Betsy. The provisions in the quarter and what we saw last quarter are really driven by growth. The credit trends really across the board continue to be stable to slightly improving. If you look at just the quarter year-over-year, 30 plus was better, charge-offs were better, 90 plus was a little bit better as well. So we feel good about the overall credit trends that we're seeing.","And similar to what we said last quarter, we don't think they are going to get a lot better from here. We certainly don't see them getting worse than where they are. At least as we look out to 2015, we feel like we've got fairly good visibility that far out.","Again, we're calling for stable to slightly improving unemployment. That's a driver for us. We're also not planning to make any changes to how we're underwriting today, so those are the two biggest inputs and how we think credit is going to trend next year and we think that if those are going to be stable to slightly improving that gives us some comfort that we think the charge-off trends and delinquency should be pretty stable as well.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, that's super. Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. I guess you kind of gave us a little bit higher metrics for a couple of the key factors and a little bit better growth, a little bit better net interest margin, a little lower expenses. I mean could you talk a little bit about what's underlying that because some of your competitors I think kind of have been going in opposite directions on some of those metrics?","Brian Doubles","Yes. I think, Moshe, I'd say the key thing for us is when we provided the prior guidance, it was kind of a mix of short-term and long-term targets for the business. I think we've got better line of sight to what we think 2015 is going to look like. If you compare the guidance that we're providing for 2015, it's not that far off of what we actually delivered in 2014. So I think that gives us some comfort.","We continue to see pretty solid growth. We don't have anything really bullish in there on retail sales. We're still assuming that we trend along at 2% to 3%. Our goal, as we've talked about in the past, is to grow two to three times the retail environment in the industries that we operate in. So that gives us some comfort that we'll continue to be in that 6% to 8% range. That lines up pretty closely with where we were in the fourth quarter.","And I'd call the rest of the adjustments kind of slight enhancements to where we were previously and that's just really attributable to continuing to execute on the things that we have to execute on and just having a little bit better line of sight to 2015.","Moshe Orenbuch","Certainly, all right. And just following up on the asset growth, anything that you can tell us about the consumers' willingness, ability and willingness to kind of carry debt that you're seeing?","Margaret Keane","Yes. It's remained pretty stable. We're not seeing any big movements there at all. I would tell you that overall the consumers definitely continue to show positive momentum in terms of spending. I think consumer confidence is up, employment is up, certainly gas prices are going to help because people have more discretionary dollars. So we're not really seeing a big shift in how they are revolving with us.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Don Fandetti","Yes, Brian, you guys have made some very good progress with your online bank. There is some concern around what happens to the online franchises when the Fed raises rates. I was wondering if you could talk about how you factored in a deposit beta and what your overall thought on that risk is as you look out into potential rate hike.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, Don. It's something obviously we're spending a lot of time working on right now and there's not a lot of history that you can draw from. Obviously, if you go back to 2004 to 2007, that was the last kind of rising rate environment where we had online banks. There's been quite a bit published around that time period and online banks had a deposit beta of 60 to 70. Branch-based banks were around 40. We expect to be in that 60 to 70 kind of range. To the extent that we're still trying to grow, it may be closer to 70 than 60. I think time will tell.","I think there's a couple of things that you should factor in though first. Given the fact that we don't have expensive branch infrastructure to support, we feel like that's a pretty affordable deposit beta given our margins. So that's kind of how we've thought about it. That's factored into the net interest margin guidance that we provided for 2015. So we feel like we can manage a rising rate environment with the online deposit platform.","Don Fandetti","Okay. And one housekeeping item. Were there two extra days of income in the quarter?","Brian Doubles","I think one extra day.","Don Fandetti","One extra day. Okay. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Jeff Lengler with Goldman Sachs.","Jeff Lengler","Hi, good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning, Jeff.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Jeff Lengler","At least on the surface, it looks like the BP partnership is another contract that will have the Dual Card or co-brand capabilities. I guess as you think about new partnerships you could add, how much of an emphasis on these co-brand partnerships do you have versus traditional private label and can you just talk about the economics or margins as they compare to just the traditional private label?","Margaret Keane","Sure. So we like co-brand and I think it's fair to say that our co-brand works a little different than our competitors in the sense that a traditional co-brand runs on the network when they are at the pump, if you will. And for us, our Dual Card runs on our closed loop network, so one of the big positives for us is we really get additional data as we work with those partners, as well as we don't charge interchange.","So there is I think a difference there. In terms of our pricing, I think the way to think \u2013 they're actually very close in pricing, they just get there a little differently. I think there's higher receivables, loan losses and interchange on the Dual Card. Private label has more evolved, so that's really the difference.","Jeff Lengler","Okay. And then just on liquidity, I think it was at like $13.4 billion or 18% of assets and it looks like you started to deploy a modest amount into investment securities. I know you're not subject to the LCR right now, but can you just remind us how you think about what is the right level of liquidity on your balance sheet, how much do you need to set aside for dry powder and do you have any preliminary estimates on where you would shake out on the LCR? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes. So we use a variety of metrics to size the liquidity portfolio for the business. First, we run internal liquidity stress scenarios. We also look at our maturities coverage, wholesale maturity coverage and we manage to some metrics there and then we look at LCR and any other applicable regulatory guidance. And it's really a combination of those factors that help us size liquidity for the business.","I'll tell you we're comfortably above LCR. LCR is not a constraint. We don't expect it to be a constraint going forward. The only thing I'd point out on liquidity, the fourth quarter tends to be a low point for liquidity for us just given the growth in the receivables balance. You'll see it come up a little bit in the first, second and third quarters as a percentage of assets.","Jeff Lengler","Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Brad Ball with Evercore.","Brad Ball","Thank you. With respect to the separation application you said you're applying first half 2015, is it still reasonable to expect that you could gain approval from the Fed sometime in the second half and complete the separation from GE by year-end 2015?","Margaret Keane","Sure. Let me give you a little flavor on that. So as I said, we'll submit the first half. We're making very good progress on the infrastructure build-out. We've hired a team. Our forward governance is in place. We brought up our IT data center, so we're moving our applications and infrastructure into the new data center. Treasury, risk, infrastructure are all there.","So the way it's going to work is once we submit the application, the Fed will come in and do a review and what they're really going to be looking for is are we standalone ready. That process is new to the Fed in a way because we'll be the first company coming out after the crisis and it will be new for us. So our goal and our target is the end of the year, but the reality is it will be up to the Fed to give us that approval.","Brad Ball","Great, very helpful. And then my follow-up question is on oil prices and gas prices at the pump. Are you seeing any notable impacts on either sales volume or on receivables and credit in the quarter, or so far this quarter and what's your outlook for the impact of lower gas prices in the business? Then just real quickly what's the size of the BP business? What's the size of the opportunity there?","Brian Doubles","Sure. So let me start on your first question. I think it's still a little bit too early to tell if we're seeing any real impact from gas prices where they are. We expect this to be a positive for the consumer. Obviously, it should be a positive for us. We think with that additional discretionary income, they are going to certainly spend a portion of that \u2013 we believe they will spend a portion of that on our cards, so that's a positive for us.","We haven't factored in any real lift there in terms of our outlook for 2015 just because I think it's still a little bit too early to tell, but it's hard to view it as anything but positive. So I think that's good. Then in terms of BP, we're not in a position to disclose the size of the portfolio, but even after we bring on BP, if we look at our concentration of oil and gas in the portfolio, it's less than 3% of receivables. So this is a space where we have continued opportunity to grow. It's a space we like.","Brad Ball","Great, thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. I had a follow-up on the separation question. Assuming you are able to get the separation approved at year-end, can you remind us what that means for the timing of your ability to do a dividend and buybacks?","Brian Doubles","Yes. So we're speculating to some extent. I think we've got to file the application, we've got to get through the process and then we will have a little bit better line of sight to how it's going to work post-separation, but our expectation is that after we receive the approval to separate, we would get a capital plan on file with our regulators very shortly thereafter and then subject to their approval, we would begin to deploy capital and start a regular dividend.","So the timing is definitely post-separation, but it's a little difficult to get any more precise around it.","Mark DeVries","Okay. And am I correct in thinking that the dividend would come first and then buybacks would be a subsequent event?","Brian Doubles","That's right, that's right. Our priorities are dividend first and establishing a regular dividend for our shareholders and then looking at a buyback program.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. And then I just wanted to clarify something about the guidance. I think you indicated that on the 6% to 8% outlook for receivable growth, a majority of that will be organic. Although is most of the delta between the 6% and the 8% and the prior 5% plus the BP, or are you also more optimistic on your organic growth outside of BP?","Brian Doubles","Yes. I'd say we've got a little bit better line of sight to our organic growth too and we're feeling more optimistic there as well. But the 6% to 8% does include BP.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Good morning. You noted that you plan to be about neutral to maybe slightly asset-sensitive towards the end of the year when most people expect rates to rise, but as you grow loans, do you anticipate some of the asset sensitivity rising given some of the more variable-rate loans? And how confident are you at increasing repricing opportunities in Payment Solutions and CareCredit purchase volumes, which tend to be a little more fixed?","Brian Doubles","Yes. So there's a couple of things to think about, just where we ended the fourth quarter will again be slightly asset-sensitive so 100 basis point parallel shock to interest rates would take our net interest income up about $50 million. So that's fairly consistent with where we have been in the past. That's very slight from our perspective.","Overall, our goal is to minimize the interest rate risk that we're taking. So we try and match our assets and liabilities by duration. We also look at fixed versus variable. The one thing, more specific to your question, to factor in for CareCredit and Payment Solutions is that those are fixed-rate assets to the consumer, but as rates rise, given the highly promotional nature in those businesses, we charge the merchants what we call a merchant discount and that is variable rate. So as we're bringing new business on the books, there's definitely an offset there in how we price those promotions to the merchants.","David Ho","Okay. So the asset sensitivity could be a little understated. In terms of the strong volumes that you were seeing on the purchase volume side, how much of that was from Dual Card and how do you size that opportunity over time because we're seeing a nicer translation of the interchange fees versus some of your peers?","Brian Doubles","Yes. We continue to see good Dual Card growth. We don't break that out separately, but part of the reason is if you think about our overall strategy for the most part is a low and grow strategy. We talked about this in the past. So we start out consumers with a smaller line PLCC card. And then over time we watch them and then we upgrade them to a larger PLCC line and then ultimately we upgrade them into a Dual Card. We like that strategy. We think its prudent risk management, but just given that dynamic of transferring an existing PLCC customer into a Dual Card product, you're always going to see higher growth rates in Dual Card. That's been fairly consistent.","So I think that's one of the \u2013 that's certainly one of the drivers driving the Dual Card growth. The other thing I'd point out is we did launch some very attractive value propositions last quarter. The new value prop on the Sam's Club card, the 531 has been very well-received. That's performing probably a little bit better than our expectations, so we've been pleased to see that. So that's driving some of the interchange growth that you see as well.","David Ho","Great, thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Hey, guys, thanks for taking my question. You've essentially raised the outlook modestly in terms of asset growth. Asset growth is really derivative of purchase volumes. Just curious if you're assuming the correlation is exactly the same or there's any change there because I'm assuming a lot of this has to do with the BP contract, as you had mentioned before and just wondering if there's anything in the nature of that contract where that correlation is different.","Brian Doubles","I would think about it similarly. I don't think when it comes to purchase volume receivables I would think about it different than our historic trends even with BP. Some of the oil and gas portfolios turn a little bit quicker so you'd see higher purchase volume and a little less translate into receivables. But generally, we like to provide receivables guidance for you guys just given that's how we earn the vast majority of our income. Interchange isn't as impactful for us, so that's why we thought the receivables guidance would be a little bit more helpful.","Rick Shane","Perfect, thanks, Brian. And just to follow up on that, again, that contract \u2013 the cards will go into place in the second quarter. Should we assume that, and again you've talked about the fact that there are incremental reasons why you raised the asset growth guidance. We should assume, however, that a lot of that is going to be back-end loaded in the year.","Brian Doubles","I don't know if I'd necessarily assume that, Rick. The majority of the growth continues to be organic growth. So I wouldn't make the assumption that it's back-half loaded. I would \u2013 it is probably easiest to model it with BP starting at the beginning of the third quarter, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't\u2026","Rick Shane","Got it.","Brian Doubles","Assume that that's dramatically different than what we've been seeing on the organic side.","Rick Shane","Brian and I apologize, I should have been clearer. The incremental on top of what you had previously given will be a little bit more back-end-loaded, not for the overall year.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Specific to BP, I would build it in second half.","Rick Shane","Okay, great. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura Securities.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. There's been a lot of focus recently among the general purpose card issuers surrounding growth driven reserve building and in particular how growth tends to drive charge-off rates higher into the season and approach peak losses somewhere around year two. For you guys, your allowance as a percentage of period end losses seems very stable, but I was hoping that you could talk about how that growth dynamic is impacting you and whether there are any notable differences in the normal seasoning effects that you observe in private label versus general purpose card lending?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Bill, I'd say the seasoning that we see in private label is pretty consistent to what you'd see in general purpose card. I think 18 to 30 months for peak charge-offs is pretty consistent whether you look at general purpose or you look at PLCC or Dual Card. So I think that's fairly consistent.","There is some seasoning impact I think in our book. We're not seeing it as a big driver though and one of the things I think you have to take into account is that our growth rates have been very consistent over the last three, four years. And to the extent that you are putting on new business at the same rate that you put on business the year prior, you shouldn't see a big impact from seasoning. And so we're not seeing that I think to the same extent that maybe others are. We think the charge-offs and the growth rates are going to be fairly consistent and fairly stable.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. That's really helpful. And as a follow-up, I had a question, a follow-up on Dual Card and your comments there. Can you talk about whether you guys expect the longer term or how you're thinking about the longer-term credit performance of your private label versus your Dual Card products? I don't believe that in the last cycle that you guys were growing as much in Dual Card and I guess I'm thinking of that in the context of how in past cycles we've seen the greater utility in Dual Card generally result in higher credit losses while the limited utility of private label has actually been a positive. So I'm wondering how you're thinking about all that from an underwriting perspective on those products.","Margaret Keane","Yes. I think one of the positives is the fact that in many of our retailers, we offer both products and I think that gives us some flexibility if we were to enter a cycle, particularly on origination. But I think the bottom line here is just how we do our underwriting. We talked about the low and grow strategy, so we start you out with a private label, give you a little bigger private label card and then offer you the Dual Card. So I think just how we go to market on our Dual Card is different than the traditional co-brand and gives us some flexibility in a crisis or a deteriorating credit environment.","Brian Doubles","I think the other thing just to point out is that we're pretty disciplined on Dual Card around line sizes. So even though a Dual Card will carry a larger line than PLCC, we are not talking about the same kind of lines that you'd see in a general purpose card.","Bill Carcache","Got it. That's very helpful. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Dan Werner with Morningstar.","Dan Werner","Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Could you give me a little color on the deposit funding in terms of how much is brokered versus how much is through the direct bank and where do you see the growth rates for each of those going forward?","Brian Doubles","Sure. I think we had a little over $12 billion of broker deposit funding. Our strategy with broker deposits, there are some advantages to broker deposits I think if you use them the right way and I'll just maybe spend a minute describing how we think about the brokered versus retail deposits.","First, our goal is not to really increase broker deposits from where they are today, so we'll hold that relatively flat. We'll probably shrink it a little bit. You'll see that come down as a percentage of the overall funding stack. And right now, one of the advantages of broker deposits is that you can originate longer tenors and you can do it at attractive rates.","I think the other advantage of broker deposits is there's no early termination or early withdrawal provisions on broker deposits. So it provides a very predictable funding base for the company and it works very similarly \u2013 looks very similar to a term loan, if you will.","And so that's why we think it will continue to have a place in our funding stack, but it's not a funding source that we're looking to grow. So it will continue to shrink and it has over the last couple of years.","Dan Werner","Okay. And this is as a follow-up. In terms of acquiring other card portfolios or other deposit bases, is that pretty much limited due to the fact that you're going through the separation process with the Fed?","Brian Doubles","No. I think portfolio acquisitions that are in our core and align very well with one of our three sales platforms, we're definitely pursuing those. BP is a great example of that. So we don't feel like we're restricted on normal course portfolio acquisitions at all. We've been very active, as Margaret mentioned earlier, we've got a very active BD pipeline, so we continue to pursue those opportunities and we will continue to do so.","Dan Werner","Okay. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Yes. Thanks very much. Most of my questions have been asked, but a couple nuance questions. Number one, with respect to the NIM guidance, which is slightly up, what are the drivers of that, is there anything going on with yields or is it primarily related to the early January payoff of the debt?","Brian Doubles","That's certainly part of it. I wouldn't read it as a significant change from the earlier guidance. We were guiding to near 15%. This is 15% to 15.5%. I think we've got better line of sight to how we think 2015 is going to play out. Maybe a slightly different expectation on interest rates played through there a little bit and I think we're optimistic that we'll be able to pay down the bank loan and the GE Capital loan well ahead of the contractual maturity. Just given those are more expensive forms of debt, we think we'll save a little bit of money there on interest expense. Those are related factors we were just able to tighten that up a bit.","John Hecht","Okay. That's helpful. And then with respect to the RSA, given the composition of the partners, the consideration of BP, anything that we should expect in terms of changing that as a percentage of receivables or should that be pretty consistent throughout the year?","Brian Doubles","Well, it's been very consistent. In 2013, it was around 4.5% of average receivables. It was 4.5% in 2014. A couple small changes as we think about 2015.","First, just given some of the value proposition launches, loyalty expense is up, that runs through the retailer share, so there was a partial offsets there. The two programs that exited in the fourth quarter we paid a disproportionately higher share in both of those programs.","And so just by nature of those going away, that will save us a little bit on the RSA line. So I would think about it running just under that 4.5% range for 2015.","John Hecht","Great. Thanks very much.","Brian Doubles","Sure.","Margaret Keane","So before we conclude the call today, I want to thank the investment community and especially our shareholders for their continued support. I also want to thank our team for a remarkable 2014. We really accomplished a great deal together this year. And the hard work will continue in 2015 as we seek to further leverage our distinctive market position and enhance our capabilities to help our partners and to grow our business. We like our position and prospects and we're very excited about the future of Synchrony Financial and look forward to continued progress towards our objectives.","Greg Ketron","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

After we complete the presentation we will open the call up for questions. Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us. As you are aware, the fourth quarter marked a major milestone for our company. We completed the separation from GE through the successful execution of the exchange offer. We're very proud of this significant accomplishment.","There are likely several new shareholders on the call today as a result. We welcome you. And several previous owners that may have opted for larger stakes in our company during the time of transition. We thank you for all your support in making this transaction a success and the team looks forward to seeing you this year. We're excited about our future prospects as a focused, standalone company and look forward to reporting our progress to you.","We were honored to have our stock added to the S&P 500 index upon consummation of the exchange offer. This is a testament to our strong position among leading financial services companies. During the call today I will first provide a review of the fourth quarter. Brian will then give more details on our financial results and outline our 2016 outlook. Finally, I will conclude with the overview of our strategic priorities. I will begin on slide 3.","Fourth quarter net earnings totaled $547 million or $0.65 per diluted share. Overall strong momentum continued across each of our business platforms driving strong purchase volume, receivables and platform revenue growth for this quarter. Compared to the fourth quarter of last year, purchase volume grew 8% with holiday sales supporting this strong growth. Online and mobile sales volume was a key component of our holiday sales.","Our online and mobile sales growth steadily accelerated throughout last year with fourth quarter sales growing 23% over the same quarter of the prior year. Our online and mobile sales growth has far outpaced U.S. growth trends which have been in the 14% to 15% range. We delivered another quarter of strong receivables growth. Loan receivables were up 11% and platform revenue grew 5%. Asset quality strengthened as demonstrated by a 9 basis point decline in our net charge-off rate and an 8 basis point improvement in 30-plus day delinquencies.","Expenses were in line with our expectations, with the increase being largely driven by investments being made in support of growth initiatives, as well as the infrastructure build associated with our establishment as a standalone company. Deposit growth continued at a very strong pace, with deposits increasing $8 billion or 24%, to $43 billion. Deposits now comprise 64% of our funding sources, squarely in line with our targeted range of 60% to 70%. Competitive rates, outstanding customer service and the continued enhancement of our product suite have driven these results.","One of our strategic priorities is to build Synchrony Bank into a leading full scale online bank. And we plan on launching new product offerings later this year to growth and further boost the retention of our deposit base. Our balance sheet remains strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 16.8% calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 18%, of total assets at quarter end.","During this time of transition we remained very focused on driving business momentum. During the fourth quarter alone we renewed several key relationships including Dick's Sporting Goods, Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring. We also launched two of our recent wins with Newegg and Stash Hotel Rewards. We're enthusiastic about the prospects for these relationships and our ability to continue delivering significant value to these programs. Driving organic growth remains a key opportunity and we rigorously pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepen penetration across all our partnerships.","Given the rapid pace of change within the digital payments area, online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business and we're seizing the opportunities that are being presented to us by the swiftly changing environment. Through our innovation and strategic partnerships we're helping to shape the future of how private label cards function in mobile wallets and provide value to our merchants and their consumers across mobile channels.","This quarter we launched two mobile applications that leverage innovative technology to provide enhanced functionality across our mobile product suite. Both of these efforts build upon collaboration with our strategic partner, GPShopper, a leader in integrated mobile platforms among retail clients.","First we launched the CareCredit mobile application. This app, available on the Apple Store and Google Play, enables millions of CareCredit cardholders convenient access to account servicing options. It includes the ability to locate healthcare providers and help focus merchants which can facilitate the connection across CareCredit's more than 195,000 total merchant locations.","The app also features access to a digital card and offers a variety of value added notifications and updates. We already have seen more than 700,000 visits to date. We also launched the CarCareONE mobile app which readily connects millions of CarCareONE cardholders to more than 23,000 automotive related merchants nationwide. Users can quickly and easily access account servicing, a location finder and offers such as special financing on their smartphones. We also launched a pilot with JCPenney to offer their private label credit cards in Apple Pay.","We continue to seek ways to increase the utility of our cards and their usage. Mobile applications are one of the ways we can readily connect cardholders and partners. In doing so we improve the experience for the cardholder, help to increase engagement and ultimately drive more purchase volume.","Moving to slide 4 which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remains strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 5%. The addition of the BP program in the second quarter also contributed to the annual growth rate.","Platform revenue increased 5% over the fourth quarter of last year. We continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing and marketing offers that will resonate with our partners and customers. On the next slide I will discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail.","We continued to deliver solid performance across all three of our sales platforms in the fourth quarter. Retail Card generated strong performance this quarter. Purchase volume growth was 8% and receivables grew 12%. The addition of BP in the second quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 5%. As you may recall, there was a $46 billion gain on sale of portfolios in the fourth quarter of 2014.","Renewing and extending our programs remain a key priority in this business and our success on this front is a testament to the strength and depth of our partnerships. This quarter we renewed our long-standing relationship with Dick's Sporting Goods, a key partner. With this extension we have nearly 92% of our Retail Card receivables under contract to 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for future growth.","Payment Solutions delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 9% and receivables grew 12% driving platform revenue growth of 7%. Average active accounts increased 11% over last year. The majority of the industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volumes and receivables with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products. We were very pleased to have extended our long term relationship with Discount Tire, P.C. Richard & Son, Polaris and Mohawk Flooring this quarter.","CareCredit had a solid quarter, purchase volume growth was 9% and receivables grew 7% driving platform revenue growth of 3%. Average active accounts increased 6% over last year. Receivables growth this quarter was once again led by our dental and veterinary specialties.","In terms of business developments, we announced that Rite Aid is now accepting our CareCredit cards for prescriptions and general merchandise purchases in all 4,600 Rite Aid stores in the United States. CareCredit also announced the expansion of the patient financing agreement with National Vision, one of the largest optical retailers in the U.S. with over 800 locations across 43 states.","In summary, each platform delivered solid results and continued to make progress in the development, extension and deepening of important relationships while continuing to drive organic growth. I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter and our outlook for 2016.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Margaret. I will start on slide 6 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter the business earned $547 million in net income which translates to $0.65 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11% and platform revenue up 5%. Overall we're pleased with the growth we generated across the business in 2015.","The value propositions on our cards continue to resonate with consumers. The business delivered growth in average active accounts as well as increases in purchase volume and the average balance per active account compared to last year. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the second quarter so that helped improve our growth rate year over year. Platform revenue included a $46 million gain on sale of the portfolios in the fourth quarter of last year and excluding the gain platform revenue growth was 7%. Net interest income was up 8% in the quarter mainly driven by the growth in receivables.","RSAs were up $36 million or 5%, compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were slightly under 4.5% for the quarter compared to 4.6% last year. On a full-year basis RSAs were 4.4% of average receivables in 2015 compared to 4.5% last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due to programs we exited last year where we paid a higher RSA as a percentage of average receivables as well as higher loyalty costs that are shared through the RSA with our retailers. The RSA percentage on a full-year basis has been relatively stable, around 4.5% for the past three years.","The provision increased $26 million or 3%, compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth partially offset by the improvement in asset quality. The improvement in asset quality is reflected in lower 30-plus delinquencies which improved 8 basis points versus last year to 4.06% and the net charge-off rate which fell to 4.23%, 9 basis points below last year.","Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables is down 16 basis points compared to the fourth quarter last year to 5.12%. However, measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.3 times. This is consistent with the coverage level over the past four quarters which has been in the 1.2 to 1.3 times range. Overall our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable.","Other income decreased $75 million versus last year primarily driven by the $46 million gain on portfolio sales last year, but also higher loyalty and rewards costs partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $27 million driven by continued growth in out of store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $34 million primarily driven by new value propositions.","As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through our RSAs so there is a partial offset on each of these items. Debt cancellation fees of $62 million were down $5 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $78 million versus the fourth quarter of last year. In addition to the infrastructure build that is now in the expense run rate, the majority of the increase was driven by growth and strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities.","The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 34% and 33.5% year to date which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall we had strong top-line growth and drove a solid quarter generating an ROA of 2.6%. I will move to slide 7 and go through our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income was up 8% driven by loan receivable growth. The net interest margin was 15.73% for the fourth quarter, 13 basis points higher than last year.","As we had expected and noted on our third quarter earnings call, the margin experienced a seasonal decline from the third quarter due to the buildup in receivables. However, the margin was about the guidance of 15% to 15.5% we set out back in January. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. While the yield on receivables was relatively stable at 21.2%, we did see a slight improvement in interest-earning asset yields as we carried a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average for the quarter.","Cost of funding was relatively stable at 1.8% due to a higher mix of lower cost deposit funding, reductions in the bank term loan facility and the payoff of the GE capital loan which offset the cost of the senior unsecured debt issuance. Our deposit base increased by over $8 billion or 24%, year over year. We're pleased with the progress we have made growing our direct deposit platform; deposits are now 64% of our funding versus 56% last year. And while the fourth quarter margin was a little above the range we set up back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Overall we continue to be pleased with our margin performance which exceeded our guidance for the year.","Next I will cover our key credit trends on slide 8. As I noted earlier, we continue to see stable to improving trends on asset quality. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.06%, down 8 basis points versus last year; 90-plus delinquencies were 1.86%, down 4 basis points. We continue to believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends compared to last year. The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.23%, down 9 basis points versus last year.","Lastly the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.12% which was down 16 basis points from the prior year. As I noted before, if you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months charge-offs we're currently at 1.3 times coverage which equates to roughly 15.5 months loss coverage in our reserve. As I noted earlier, this is fairly consistent with prior quarters. So, overall we continue to feel good about the performance of the portfolio and the underlying economic trends we're seeing.","Moving to slide 9, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses continue to be in line and we delivered on our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year. Expenses came in at $870 million for the quarter and, compared to last year, are largely driven by separation-related costs, growth of the business and IT investments related to our digital and mobile capabilities.","Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $58 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business. Professional fees were up $26 million driven primarily by growth. Marketing and business development costs were down $37 million. The decrease was attributable to lower spend on brand advertising and marketing associated with our direct deposit products.","As you may recall, last year we did a major brand advertising campaign following our IPO. Also given the strong growth in deposits we're able to dial back some of our deposit-related marketing spend in the quarter. Information processing was up $23 million driven by higher IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. The efficiency ratio was 34% for the quarter as seasonally driven expenses tend to peak in the fourth quarter. The ratio was 33.5% for 2015, in line with our expectation of below 34% for the year.","Moving to slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first - one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business.","Over the last year we have grown our deposits by over $8 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 64% of our funding which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. And while we have now moved further within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities.","We're also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products later this year such as checking and online bill pay. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $13 billion to $15 billion range which is approximately 20% of our funding. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding.","Our third-party debt, bank term loans and senior unsecured notes totaled 16% of our funding sources. As we have said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the Bank term one facility as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business compared to deposits and other lower-cost funding sources.","We have continued to pay this down making a $500 million prepayment in early December and we also made a $1 billion prepayment in early January that will be reflected in the first quarter outstanding balance. Since the IPO we have paid down the Bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $3.2 billion currently. And we expect to continue to pay this down in future quarters. We also expect to continue issuing unsecured bonds and we issued $1 billion in three-year fixed rate senior unsecured notes in December.","Overall we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We will continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility.","Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 16.8% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 15.9% CET1 under the fully phased in Basel III rules. This compares to 14.5% on a fully phased in basis last year, an increase of 140 basis points over the past year. Total liquidity increased to $20.9 billion and includes $14.8 billion in cash and short term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 25% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LTR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LTR levels. Overall we're executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We've built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels.","Next on slide 11 I will recap our 2015 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables our growth of 11% exceeded our outlook range of 6% to 8%. The growth in 2015 was driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth, as well as the addition of BP and other program wins.","Net interest margin was 15.8% for the year which is better than the 15% to 15.5% range we provided back in January. We have continued to look for ways to deploy excess liquidity generated from strong deposit growth, taking the opportunity to pay down higher cost funding sources.","Our net charge-off rate was slightly better than we expected with net charge-offs improving 18 basis points. We attribute this to our improved credit profile as well as the improving economic environment and likely some benefit from lower gas prices. The efficiency ratio for the year was 33.5% which was in line with our guidance of below 34% for the year. Despite the investment we made to build our standalone infrastructure, our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry. We feel well-positioned to manage this going forward as we expect this business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. And lastly, we generated a return on assets of 2.9% which was at the upper end of our guidance for 2015. So overall we were pleased with the results of our financial performance in 2015.","Moving to our 2016 outlook on slide 12, our macro assumptions for 2016 are consistent with the consensus views on forward rates and unemployment, our framework assumes the Fed tightens 50 basis points this year and a stable to slightly improving unemployment rate. Our guidance for receivable growth is in the 7% to 9% range. We expect we will continue to grow sales volume at 2 to 3 times broader retail sales. This guidance doesn't assume any significant new portfolio acquisitions.","We believe our margin will be in the 15.5% range this year. If rates do increase during the year we expect our neutral to slightly asset sensitive position would provide a small benefit to our net interest income. In terms of our funding plan more broadly, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect to move towards the higher end of our target of 60% to 70% deposit funding in 2016. We will also continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets and will use the proceeds to continue to pay down the bank term loan well in advance of the contractual maturity in 2019.","In terms of credit, given the view that unemployment will be stable to slightly improving this year and our play not to change or underwriting profile, we believe our net charge-off rate will continue to be relatively stable in the 4.3% to 4.5% range we experienced in 2014 and 2015. And while we expect net charge-offs to be stable, we do not believe the benefit we received in our reserve build in 2015 will repeat and reserve posts in 2016 will be more in line with receivables growth.","Moving to the efficiency ratio, we continue to plan on running the business with an efficiency ratio below 34% on a full-year basis in 2016. Our efficiency ratio continued to compare favorably to the industry and we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term.","Finally, we continue to expect to generate a return on assets in the 2.5% to 3% range in 2016, consistent with our guidance for 2015. Before I conclude I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2016. As I have stated in the past, although we're not subject to CCAR, we're planning to follow a very similar process. We will use the Fed's CCAR assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that we'll review with our Board and our regulators in early April and hope to hear back from the Fed in June.","While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, our plans will include both dividends and share buybacks. And with that I will turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I will close with an overview of our key strategic priorities. First, we remain focused on driving growth both organically and through new program wins across our three platforms. We have historically produced organic growth of 2 to 3 times market growth rates and we expect to continue to deliver similar growth.","Innovative idea propositions and enhanced functionality and utility for card users are some of the ways in which we will accomplish this. For example, we rolled out several compelling value propositions, innovative programs like these and network expansion such as the one we initiated with Rite Aid for our CareCredit cards help to increase penetration.","We also won over 20 new deals last year and the pipeline remains strong. We have a demonstrated track record of success that we plan to continue to leverage this year and beyond as we seek to add new partners and programs with an attractive risk and return profile.","Second, we will continue to expand our robust data analytics and technology offerings. We will continue our mobile wallet development for private-label credit cards such as the pilot with JCPenney and Apple Pay. Our digital strategies have helped drive an increase in online and mobile purchase volume at a faster pace than the national growth rate. We're focused on leveraging our leading capabilities as the digital landscape evolves.","We're expanding our robust data and analytics capabilities through investments in Big Data technologies and insight tools such as data visualization software. Our partners highly value the insights we bring and the impact it has on their programs.","Third, we will continue position our business for long term growth. We will focus on building our Synchrony Bank franchise into a full-scale online bank through the development of a broad product suite to increase loyalty, diversify our funding sources and drive profitability. During 2015 we grew deposits a strong 24%. We will also leverage and explore adjacencies to our core business for growth opportunities such as expanding our small business platform.","Fourth, we will continue operating our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong liquidity and capital to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets. We intend to maintain earnings growth at attractive returns while demonstrating operating leverage.","Finally, we're highly focused on positioning the business to return capital to shareholders. And now that we're fully separated from GE we will look to return capital this year through the establishment of a dividend and share repurchase program subject to Board and regulatory approval. We believe these are the right areas of focus and plan to leverage our prior success to pave the path forward. We look forward to updating you on our progress. I will now turn the call over to Greg.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we're now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","I just wanted to follow up on a couple of things. One was the comment about the capital return that you indicated. Just wanted to clarify that this year you would be expecting to have an ask for not just a dividend but also a buyback. And so just wanted to understand how you are thinking about sizing that. And also if it is a coincident ask or is it a step ask, first ask for the [indiscernible] and then ask for the buyback at different points of time? I just wanted to understand how you are thinking through that.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, Betsy. So the way that we're thinking about it and similar to what we have said in the past is we're going to follow - even though we're not technically subject to the CCAR process, we're going to follow a similar process and timeline. So the Fed is going to publish their assumptions here shortly, probably early February, we're going to run those assumptions in our models. We're going to review a capital plan that includes both dividend and share repurchase, we will review with the risk committee, with the Board and then we'll review it with the regulators; we'll probably do that around the April timeframe.","And then similar to the other banks, we would expect to hear back and have some clarity around June. So that is how we're thinking about it. So we're optimistic that we can get something done hopefully in the second half of the year.","And in terms of the absolute magnitude of the return, we really need to go through the process. So we're just not in a position to be very specific at this point. But as we have said in the past, we're going to be very thoughtful around the first ask. It is more important for us to get a dividend and share repurchase established than it is to be very aggressive the first time out.","Betsy Graseck","Right. Okay I am just thinking through how a lot of folks have been - when you look at your capital ratio, obviously very, very strong. And you have got peers that are in the 90% payout ratio which is obviously quite high and folks that have been going through this process for several years in a row.","That said, a 30% payout ratio also looks relatively light given the very strong capital ratio you have. So I am kind of thinking that those two bookends are bookends and that you might be somewhere in between. Obviously you can't really say given the fact that the rules aren't out yet. But is that a fair way to think about what the bookends would be?","Brian Doubles","Yes, I think you have to take a look at the peers and their trajectory over a number of CCAR cycles. And now they are at elevated payout ratios. Longer term we would hope to be kind of in the same ZIP Code, but we're going to start out slower than that. We're going to be thoughtful around the first ask.","I think the other thing that you have got to keep in mind as you think about our capital return is we're growing our risk-weighted assets faster than most of the peers set. So if you just assume - let's just take the midpoint of our guidance, 8% RWA growth, we would need to retain roughly 35% of our earnings to support growth and keep the capital ratios flat. So over the long term, anything over a 65% payout ratio would then start to bring our capital ratios down more in line with peers.","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I have a couple of questions. Let me start with the first one. Just on the NIM guidance, obviously you guys have done better than your expectations. And it would seem like a lot of the factors kind of work in your favor in terms of some tools you have to enhance the NIM. Is there something we should think about in terms of pressuring the NIM going forward that would lead you to have a little bit of a more moderating outlook?","Brian Doubles","Yes, Sanjay, I wouldn't think about it necessarily as a moderating outlook. We put guidance out last year at 15% to 15.5%, we performed a little better than that. I think we were at 15.77% for the year. We said approximately 15.5% for 2016. So this isn't a significant change from our perspective from how we have been trending.","In terms of how to think about the margin for 2016, I think there is a few puts and takes. Obviously we will see slight benefits we think from deposit growth and interest rates. As I mentioned earlier, we built in two more kind of rounds of tightening, 50 basis points for the year, we will get a slight benefit from that.","But then we also expect to see some slight offsets for growth in promotional balances. We saw that in 2015, payment solutions growth continues to outpace the other platforms and those balances come on initially at a lower yield. And then we did see higher payment rates more broadly across the portfolio in 2015. So we have tried to account for all of that in the guidance of about 15.5% feels right for 2016.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And then I guess just in terms of the seasonality, obviously there is like a lot of moving factors affecting your business given you are relatively new, you have got seasonality, the capital return aspect of it. But maybe you could just help us think about ROAs across the quarter and kind of what influences that, because that would just help us kind of tie our EPS throughout the year. Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, Sanjay. So if you are looking at the ROA and if you are building off of 2015 the one thing to think about is the reserve build which I mentioned earlier on in the call. So we did receive a fairly significant benefit in the reserve built for improved performance, particularly in the first half.","So in the first quarter we only posted $19 million of reserves, we posted $47 million in the second quarter. So while we were building reserves we were getting a fairly significant offset in the first half. And given we expect credit to stabilize from here we would expect to see a higher reserve build in the first half of 2016, so more in line with our receivables growth.","And so, if you take that back to ROA, we would expect to start the year closer to the midpoint of the range. And then similar to what you saw this year in the second half, it usually ticks up a bit in the third quarter. That is where we hit that seasonal low on charge-offs. And then it typically ticks down a bit in the fourth quarter with the higher marketing spend and the seasonal charge-offs. So that gives you a good way to think about it for the year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay one final question. Just on expenses, obviously you are talking about an efficiency ratio less than 34%. But in the fourth quarter expenses were up a fair amount at 10%. Can you just talk about what is driving such strong growth? And even though you guys have this target of 34% or less than 34%, I mean you did better this year in 2015 and it would seem like you have natural operational efficiencies. So I mean, should we expect that kind of trend to continue? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, Sanjay. So as you mentioned, expenses were up 10% compared to the fourth quarter last year. In the quarter we did have $22 million of compensation-related payments that were tied to the exchange offer in the quarter. So, if you adjust for that expenses were up 7%, so more in line with growth. And in the expense growth, the 7% growth was really largely driven by the investments we're making in long term growth of the business as well as active accounts were up, obviously receivables up, etc.","As you think about 2016, we gave you very similar guidance on the efficiency ratio of below 34%. Maybe I will just spend a minute describing how we think about it. First, I would say we're very focused on driving productivity and operating leverage across the business. We will continue to get more efficient across the business.","We always start the year with a slew of productivity initiatives. We're driving things like moving more customers to e-statements and off of paper. We're improving the efficiency of our call center and collections teams. We're always trying to simplify and reduce the back office and IT systems.","Okay, but then we take those savings and we make investments that we believe are going to drive long term growth of our business. So we're investing in things like mobile, data analytics, CRM. And so, we're very focused on driving operating leverage, but we're not so wed to the efficiency ratio that we're going to stop investing in these long term growth areas.","Operator","Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Don Fandetti","Brian, can you just go a little bit about the day count impact this quarter? Trying to get a sense of what your purchase volume and platform revenue growth rates would have been without it.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, Don. So there was an impact from day count in the quarter. If you remember, in 2014 we were on GE's fiscal calendar. So in the fourth quarter of 2014 we had 94 days compared to 92 days this quarter. So this does impact some of the top-line metrics. That is part of the reason why you see purchase volume and platform revenue lagging the receivables growth a bit.","If you adjust purchase volume for day count it would move from 8% to 10% growth. And then on platform revenue, this also stands out a bit. If you adjust for the $46 million gain on sale that we had in the fourth quarter last year and the fact that we had two less days this quarter of revenue, it was up 9% which is more in line with receivables growth.","Don Fandetti","Okay and, Margaret, obviously investors are more concerned around credit these days in the U.S. But based on your guidance it looks like you are expecting some relative stability. Can you just talk a little bit about what you are seeing and what you think may be the impact sort of energy job losses could be in your portfolio mixed in with lower gas prices? And then lastly, spend at the retailer level? There has been some concern around that.","Margaret Keane","Sure. I think, as we have talked in the past, we think in 2014 most of the extra gas dollars that consumers had were really used more towards either savings or paying down some balances which we certainly saw a bit of that. I think as gas prices continue to fall, we hope that some of that now is going to be used towards spending. Haven't really seen that yet, I think it is a little early in the year to kind of see that happen.","Overall the consumer is definitely stronger. We see unemployment in a good place and we feel that is going to continue. What I would say on - in terms of portfolio itself and the impact on delinquencies in the oil and gas areas. Obviously we watched that, we're not really seeing too much of a shift there.","Our portfolio is pretty much a very big macro look at the overall economy. So we're spread out across the whole entire United States. So we watch those things, but we're not seeing a big impact there. And then lastly, we do have a couple of oil and gas portfolios, but they are 3% more or less of our receivables. So, not a big impact there either.","Don Fandetti","Okay and just one last - eCommerce growth looks like it continues to accelerate. Can you talk a little bit about the Amazon Prime partnership and kind of where you are on that?","Margaret Keane","Yes, sure. I would say overall the growth came from all of our partners, not obviously just Amazon. We have continued to work really hard at allowing our customers as frictionless a process as they can whether it is on their mobile phone or online.","Amazon continues to be a great partner for us. We're working very closely with them on the 5% offer. For those of you who have it, hopefully you saw through the holiday there was a lot more encouragement around marketing around using your 5% off. We're continuing to monitor the results of the 5% off campaign that we're doing working closely with Amazon. But overall obviously they had a great holiday and we were glad to be part of that with the offer that we had.","Operator","Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Just with respect to guidance, you moderately accelerated your expectations for loan growth. You took your range from 6% to 8% to 7% to 9%. And I am wondering can you parse that acceleration for us? Is this penetration in new partners like BP or is it increased penetration in more traditional customers or is it just better spend from the overall customer base?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, John. So when we put at a forecast, similar to what we did last year, we try not to include any new portfolio acquisitions. That is the case this year. So the 7% to 9%, it is right around our average organic growth rate over the past four years. And so, it is up a bit based on how we performed in 2015 from the guidance we gave last January. But it doesn't include any new portfolio acquisitions, it doesn't include any significant changes to the value props on our cards.","So if you remember, in 2015 we posted 11% receivables growth, but that did include that BP portfolio acquisition. We didn't build anything like that in this year. And lastly, I would just say we also didn't build any real lift on retail sales. We think they will continue to be in that 2% to 3% kind of range. So that is what we kind of based the forecast on.","John Hecht","Okay. And then you guys did have some renewals in the fourth quarter. Can you talk about anything you are seeing in terms of competitive trends in that regard? And then finally, can you remind us are there any major renewals you need to think about coming up this year?","Margaret Keane","Sure. So I will start with the renewals we did. First of all, we're thrilled about the renewals we did. I would say the competitive landscape, particularly in the space that we're in, is slightly more competitive. But I don't think it is as competitive as you are seeing in the bigger portfolios that are moving on the co-brand side. I think people, because of the engagement with our partners, I think our competitors are being fairly reasonable there because they know it is really important to have a deal that works in good and bad times because you are really working very closely with that partner. So we continue to work that.","I think some of the things that we have been able to build out, our mobile platform, our ability to demonstrate that we can bring in more sales has certainly helped us as we continue to work with our existing partners. So I would say that we feel pretty good about that. And I am sorry, your second question was?","John Hecht","Just remind us about any major new renewals--","Margaret Keane","Sure. So 92% of our Retail Card receivables are pretty much locked down to 2019 and beyond. We really don't have any one big one that is coming out before that.","Operator","Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","There has been some concern over your exposure to declining sales at some of your retail partners. Could you discuss how you are thinking about that risk and what is implicit in your 2016 receivables growth outlook for 7% to 9% in terms of expectations that you guys have baked in for how your retail partners' sales perform?","Margaret Keane","Sure. Obviously we pay close attention. I think the really positive news for us is when a retailer is having trouble, that is when the credit card program becomes even more important. And what I would say to you, it is extraordinarily important for us. This is where we should shine for our partners because we should be in there talking about how are we going to grow sales, what kind of campaigns should we be doing, how can we help you. And that is where true partnership comes in.","So I would start with that. I think when we do our plans for the year we obviously start with what are the retailers saying about their growth and then we look to do 2 to 3 times that. I would say we have been in this business a very long time, we have winners and losers every single year.","And the way we set those goals, we're able to usually drive better performance than what the retailer is doing in any given month in terms of their performance because the card becomes an even bigger part of what they are focused on. So we watch it, we're paying attention to it. But again, I would say this is where it is really important for us to show up as a partner to really help them turn things around.","Bill Carcache","Okay, that is helpful. I guess just separately following up on the points that you made about the partnership and kind of what is at the heart of that. And I think broadly the sharp contrast that we're seeing in the private label space between I guess on one side a group that does more balance sheet lending and arguably offers more of a commodity service versus at the other end of the spectrum one that has data analytics capabilities and is viewed by retail partners as somebody who can help them drive incremental sales growth.","And obviously you guys are in that latter camp. So can you maybe talk a little bit about how your pipeline looks? And how your data analytics capabilities are playing into your discussions with potential partners?","I look at like the slide that shows the 2015 performance and your receivables growth outlook then for 2015 versus what you actually came in at. Obviously BP was a part of that. But I kind of just wonder to what degree could we be looking at this potentially at some point in the future and potentially see wins - partnership wins possibly drive a little bit of upside. So, maybe if you could just give a little color on the pipeline.","Margaret Keane","Just, sure. So we have said in the past we really like partnerships that allow us to come in and really contribute and add value to the overall partnership, whether that is in the marketing front, the sales front, the data analytics front. What I would say is that every single retailer out there is up against a moderate sales or maybe even mediocre sales environment. So what we really try to do is figure out ways to leverage the tools and things we have to help them accelerate their growth.","So when we start with conversations, whether it is an existing portfolio or a new portfolio, it always starts with capabilities. And that is where we're pretty disciplined on the kind of partnerships we want because we think when you are adding value every single day and your partner is seeing that value that you are adding, that is how you are able to keep relationships long term and then price becomes the second discussion.","So that is what our job is. Our job every day for our folks out in the field, our folks who manage our partners is to really have one foot in the partner, one foot in Synchrony and really ensure that they are driving sales and helping that partner every single day. That is where analytics, our mobile application, all of this is really helping to keep those relationships and allowing us to extend them.","Operator","Our next question comes from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Brian, I just wanted to follow up on the net interest margin discussion. And could you specify what your intent is with respect to your liquidity portfolio which is a massive amount of your balance sheet particularly relative to peers and how that is going to influence your margin over the course of the year?","Brian Doubles","Yes, Eric, what we tried to do - so, I guess I would start by saying I wouldn't expect a step change from how we're managing liquidity today. We run a number of internal scenarios, we look at the applicable regulatory guidance, we look at where we think the rating agencies expect us to operate, we look at our maturities coverage and we use all of those inputs to kind of size the liquidity that we hold.","And then in 2015 what you saw us do was use anything that - based on all of those inputs, anything that we felt was truly excess liquidity, we used that to prepay the bank loan and we paid off obviously the GE Capital loan entirely. So we look at our higher cost forms of debt and we say, okay, what could we prepay and hopefully benefit the margin. And we're going to continue to do that. I just don't think - I think the improvement to expect there is going to be more around the margins rather than a step change in 2016.","The other thing I would point out is I do think there is probably a longer term opportunity as we get a little more experience with our deposit platform. I mean the other thing you have to remember is we're acquired the deposit platform in January 2013. So we have a relatively limited set of data on the deposit platform.","As we start to grow that business and we start to see how the consumer behaves, our deposit customer behaves, that will give us a little more comfort in bringing down the overall liquidity. So I think there is probably a longer term opportunity, I just don't think you are going to see a step change in 2016.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay, but just mathematically, to the extent that you continue to pay down the bank facility as you did in January, wouldn't that result in a net benefit to the cost of funds?","Brian Doubles","That would result in a net benefit to cost of funds. So as I said earlier, I think you have got some puts and takes as you think about the net interest margin. You have got a benefit from liquidity, a benefit from deposit growth and a slight benefit on interest rates if the Fed continues to tighten.","And then I think you have got some offsets on growth and promotional balances and then just a generally higher payment rate across the portfolio as consumers continue to get more cautious. So again, we were at 15.77% for the year, we said about 15.5% for 2016 and we have tried to take all of that into account as part of that guidance.","Eric Wasserstrom","Great and sorry, just one last question. Your guidance range on ROA is consistent with the prior year, but of course you ended up at 15% at the top end of the range. So does the fact that the guidance range remains the same, is the delta their year on year primarily the expectation about the reserve build?","Brian Doubles","Yes. I think that is exactly right. I would just go back to Sanjay's question where what moved us largely to the higher end of the range of 2015 was the benefit we received on the reserve build from the improved performance. If you go back, January - we were sitting at January 2015 I probably guided you to the midpoint of the range.","And then the only thing that really played out a lot different than what we thought was margin was a little bit better but really lower reserve build. I think for the year receivables grew 11%, we only built the reserve 8%. So there was an implied benefit that we received in 2015. And now that we think that things are going to stabilize we would expect reserves to grow more in line with growth in 2016.","Operator","Our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Just want to circle back to online and mobile, because it is clearly the fastest-growing channel of purchasing. I know you referenced - I think purchase volume was up in the low 20%s. Are you able to provide any granularity around how much of AR growth is actually being driven by Amazon specifically and in the mobile and online purchase channels and more broadly?","Margaret Keane","Yes. We would not disclose that, particularly Amazon. Here is what I would tell you. The way we have approached mobile is really through the whole process. So we look at applications. So one of the benefits we have is you can apply on your mobile phone and get approved and start shopping. That is a big opportunity for us there.","So if you look at just over growth in mobile applications year over here it was 73%. So we're certainly getting much more engagement from the consumers on the mobile phone. And then we go through servicing. Your ability to increase your credit line while you are standing at the store, those are the kinds of things that are really important for us.","The last piece is payments which honestly I think all of us are reading. That has turned out to be slower than what people I think thought. We're in all the wallets that we possibly can be in and we'll continue that strategy. I just think this is - mobile and online is the way people are shopping now.","We have to just continually work to embed our credit application into the application of the retailer. And that is really a lot of what we're going to be working on in 2016. So our view is this is where the industry is going or the consumer is going and we need to be in the forefront of that.","David Scharf","And along those lines, I believe that one of your private label competitors, Alliance Data\/World Financial, I believe they have used the metric that around 10% of their credit applications lately have come from mobile. Is there any more specificity around where you may be at that point?","Margaret Keane","Well, I can give you the overall just from online and mobile which we kind of calculate as the same. And about a third of our - a little more than a third of our applications are coming in that way.","David Scharf","Okay. And then lastly, Margaret, is there anything about the mobile apps, mobile process in terms of the type of data you are able to capture for marketing services purposes?","Margaret Keane","Yes, sure. I think this whole data thing connected with mobile and online is really critical, because one of the benefits of our cards is because they run on a closed loop network. We can actually see how the customer is shopping. So we know they made a purchase on their mobile phone or they made a purchase online or they were in the store. And this is information and data we're really trying to pull together to really help our partners think through how they are even marketing to their customers.","So, for instance, if we know someone shops multichannel meaning online, mobile and in-store, we have a very loyal customer and someone who tends to shop more often. And their baskets will be bigger and they will make more trips. So we want to make sure we're marketing to customers that way.","So if you only use mobile we know that; we will market to you only using mobile or digital kinds of marketing versus someone who is maybe only shopping at the point of sale. So I think as we continue to expand our data analytics this will become, I think, an even more critical aspect of how we help our partners.","David Scharf","Yes, it sounds like you are able to capture more and basically provide more differentiated marketing services. And just lastly, as you think about the increased data set you are able to capture through mobile and the opportunities to target more effectively, are any of the retail partners looking for additional type of promotional offers or campaigns? I'm just trying to get a sense whether the shift in channel towards mobile and online is ultimately going to impact the types of marketing services that they are going to look to you to provide.","Margaret Keane","We work together with a partner and I'd say it is really a range. You have partners who are fairly sophisticated and see mobile as being a big channel for them and are really - we work with them on the marketing and how we're going out there. I think others are still figuring it out.","One of the benefits I think we have been able to bring particularly to our smaller retailers, we partnered with GPShopper. Many of those smaller retailers don't have a mobile application. So just bringing that partnership together and then us embedding our credit application within their mobile app, that is where the partnership piece comes in.","We can really take some of the learnings we have from our big retailers, apply to the smaller retailers and help them get their product set, if you will, right on the mobile phone. So, a lot of work going on that.","David Scharf","Okay. And then with a third of your credit apps coming through mobile, is there any difference in the acceptance approval rates, the borrower profile that is coming through that channel?","Margaret Keane","Yes, there are, there are. Our approval rates on mobile and online are lower than in-store.","Operator","Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Most of my questions have been asked and answered, but just wondering if you could talk about at all how your hopes and aspirations around some external M&A opportunities might be impacting your capital ask. And I know you don't want to size the total capital ask, but is there any guidance you can give us on the proportion of that that may come from the dividend?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So first on M&A, it is really the fourth priority for us. So in terms of our capital priorities organic growth is first and foremost. Dividend would be second, share repurchase third and then M&A fourth. We have a regular process around M&A opportunities. Anything that we would do on the M&A side would be largely capability driven, things that would be easier to buy than to build internally and would help us grow our core business.","So don't expect things in other asset lending classes, it won't be too far from the core, it will be more capability driven. And obviously if we have line of sight to something we would build that into the capital plan - the capital planning process.","And then just in terms of there is not a whole lot of guidance I can give you on magnitude or dividend, share repurchase split at this point. We need to go through the process which is going to kick off here shortly. The only thing I would point out is if you look at others' dividend payout ratios, they're all kind of in the same ZIP Code. Over time we would expect to be in the same kind of ZIP Code, but there is really not much more that I can give you this point.","Mark DeVries","Okay. And when I said M&A I kind of meant it more generically to also include portfolio acquisitions from new partnerships. Is that something that--?","Brian Doubles","Absolutely, I actually lump that into organic growth for us. It would be part of that bucket. If we had line of sight to something we would absolutely build that into the capital planning process. And as Margaret said, we have got a very good pipeline in all three of our platforms. I would characterize the deals as small to midsize deals, not the megadeals that are getting a lot of the attention right now. It is kind of the stuff that is core to our business and the stuff that we have done over the last two, three years.","Operator","Our final question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just following up on that last comment, Brian, the new partners that you announced last quarter, Citgo and Guitar Center, have those been in the numbers? Are they coming in during 2016--","Brian Doubles","Guitar Center is in the numbers. Yes, Greg will get back to you on Citgo.","Moshe Orenbuch","And just maybe kind of just more high level, as you think about - some of the previous questions talked a little bit about retailers struggling a little bit. Can you talk a little bit how does your relationship with the retailer kind of evolve in that scenario?","Margaret Keane","Yes, I would say we have more marketing meetings for sure. So I think we have retailers who have good and bad times. And if you just go back to the crisis, many retailers were struggling and sales were way down. I think this is probably the most important part of our business model that I think sometimes is not really understood which is part of our success of keeping relationships for a very long period of time is you really need to stick by the retailer when they are going through that challenge.","And what I would say is we have part meetings, we're looking at ways to help them, we're trying to engage more on their strategy. So I would say even at the more senior levels we're usually talking about, okay, what are you trying to focus on, how can we help you and really drive that kind of engagement. Most of our engagement, particularly at the bigger retailers, are at the CFO\/CEO level. So the card program is such an important part of their sales that we usually just have more engagement on what else can we be doing.","Brian Doubles","And Moshe, just to come back on the Citgo question. It is in the guidance for 2016, but it is a relatively small portfolio. We think it will come in in the first quarter most likely.","Greg Ketron","Okay, thanks, everyone, for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. Have a great day.","Operator","And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide an overview of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results.","I'll begin on Slide 3. Second quarter net earnings totaled $496 million or $0.61 per diluted share. Consistent execution of our strategy yielded solid performance across our sales platform. Organic growth remains the priority and help to drive double-digit loan receivables and net interest income growth. Additionally, purchase volume was up 6% and average active accounts were up 5% over the second quarter of last year. These metrics are highlighted on Slide 4 of today\u2019s presentation.","Our focus on continuing to drive incremental value to our partners and card holders is helping us to generate growth across the business. Particularly, the investments we have been making to extend our digital capabilities are having an impact on our performance. For Retail Card, our online and mobile purchase volume grew 18%, exceeding U.S. growth trends which has been around 14% to 15% and our digital sales penetration was 23% in the second quarter.","Moving to credit quality, net charge-offs came in at 5.42% this quarter compared to 4.51% last year. Provision for loan losses was up 30% driven by credit normalization and growth. The reserve build this quarter 325 million in-line with our expectation. Brian will provide more details on credit later in the call.","The efficiency ratio was 30.1% for the quarter versus 31.9% last year as we continue to generate positive operating leverage. An important funding objective for us is expanding our deposit base and we continue to execute strong deposit growth this quarter. Overall, deposits increased $6 billion or 14% to $53 billion. deposits now comprise 72% of our funding sources.","Competitive rates and customer service should help us to continue to grow deposits, so I will note that over the longer term we expect for that growth trends to be more in-line with our receivables growth.","Regarding capital on liquidity, our common equity Tier-1 ratio was 17.4% and liquid assets totaled $15 billion or 17% of total assets at quarter end. During the quarter we announced a new capital plan that meaningfully increases our capital returns to shareholders. Under the new plan we had increased our dividend to $0.15 per share and can repurchase up to 1.64 billion of our common stock.","Looking at the business highlights this quarter, we signed a new partnership with zulily an e-commerce retailer, to launch their first private label credit card program. The launch of the zulily credit card is expected in late 2017 or early 2018. And will provide millions of customers an additional payment options with added value to card holders. Additionally QBC\u2019s card holders will have expanded card utility as they will be able to use their card to make purchases on zulily.","We continue to seek new partnerships to augment growth and we are excited to launched our new program with Nissan and Infiniti during the quarter. The new co-branded cars enabled qualified card holders to earn points to the purchase or lease of new or certified pre-owned vehicles. Plan can also be used for the purchase of automotive services and accessories or be redeemed in the form of statement credit. During the quarter, we were happy to a renew existing relationships with MEGA Group USA, City Furniture and National Veterinary Associates.","Turning to Slide 5, I\u2019ll spend a few moments on our sales platform performance. We continue to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the second quarter. In retail card, we grew loan receivables 10% over last year, reflecting broad based growth across our partner programs. Purchase volume grew 7% and average active accounts growth was 3%. Interest and seasonal loans increased 12%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. As I noted earlier, we had an active quarter with the signing of new partnership with zulily and the launch of our Nissan, Infiniti program.","We have developed strong long-term relationship that solidify our position space, helping us to drive strong organic growth and provide the foundation to the addition of new profitable partnerships. We continue to build out our mobile capabilities and leverage our recent acquisition of GPShopper, who has helped us to develop or Synchrony Plug-In or Sy-Pi capability.","Sy-Pi is a native credit feature that plugs into a retailer\u2019s mobile app. It allows retailers credit card holders easily shop, redeem rewards, and securely manage and make payments to their accounts with their smartphones. Though in the early stages 12 of our retailers\u2019 app are utilizing the technology and we have seen a notable increase in usage by card holders. Bill payments have increased significantly, to-date approximately 160 million in payments have been processed through the app. In total, we have had over eight million visits to the plug-in since we launch it.","Payment solutions also delivered a solid quarter, broad based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products resulted in loan receivables growth of 11%. Purchase volume grew 6% excluding the impact in the loss of sales due to the HHGregg bankruptcy. Average active accounts were up 11% and interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth.","We are pleased to have renewed programs that MEGA Group USA and City Furniture during the quarter. And we continue to enhance our Synchrony Car Care program adding additional utility to nearly three million card holders to excess to more than 185,000 fuel stations nationwide and we continue to extent card we use in payment solutions, which represented 27% of purchase volume in the second quarter.","CareCredit also delivered strong quarter, receivables growth of 11% was led by a dental and veterinary specialties, purchase volume grew 11% and average active accounts were up 10%. Interest and fees on loans increased 12%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. We recently renewed our relationship with National Veterinary Associates, the largest owner of free standing veterinary hospitals in the U.S.","We also announced in a multi-year agreement with Athletico Physical Therapy. This relationship provide patients of athletics over 370 physical and occupational therapy facilities across the country full access to CareCredit\u2019s health, wellness and personal care credit card. We continue to strength in our position in core elective and dental specialties with over 200,000 provider location and over 75% penetration in several key specialties.","CareCredit is moving into additional areas including team management, orthopedics, primary care, medical diagnostics and durable medical equipment with nearly 5,000 practices added over the past 12 months. The provider locator has become an important resource for card holders and we are now seeing over 800,000 hits per month. The network expansion and increased use of the card has help drive reuse, which represented 53% of purchase volume in the second quarter.","Each platform delivered strong results and continue to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to card holders.","I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.","Brian Doubles","Thanks Margaret. I will turn on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the second quarter Synchrony earned $496 million of net income which translates to $0.61 per diluted share. We continue to deliver strong growth with loan receivables up 11% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 12% over last year. Overall, we are pleased with the growth we\u2019ve generated across the business.","Purchase volume grew 6% over last year. We had another strong quarter in average active accounts growth which increased 5% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances and spend with growth in average balance per average active account of 6% compared to last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables.","While we had strong top-line growth and positive operating leverage in the quarter, which we share with our retailers, RSAs were up only five million from last year. This was due to higher incremental provision expense and loyalty program expense that I will touch on shortly.","RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.6% for the quarter, down from 4% last year. Given this, we now think RSAs will run closer to 4% for 2017. The provision for loan losses increased 30% over last year, driven by credit normalization and growth. The reserve build in the quarter was 325 million which was in-line with the expectations we laid out in the first quarter earnings call. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail when we will review Slide eight later.","Other income was 26 million lower than the prior year due mainly to higher loyalty expense which increased 71 million compared to the prior year. 37 million of the increase in loyalty expense was largely driven by growth. The remaining 34 million of the increase related to higher redemption rates we experienced over the last few months in one of our programs. This updated estimate relates to rewards that were earned in 2016 through the first quarter of 2017. Adjusting for that, the growth in loyalty program expense was more in-line with our historical run rate.","Going forward we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near a 100% with some quarterly fluctuations. And as I noted previously we share loyalty program expense with the retailers through the RSA, and this did lower the RSA level in the second quarter as well as our expectation for the year. Partially offsetting the impact of higher loyalty expense and other income was an $18 million pre-tax gain from a small transaction relating to the sale of merchant acquiring relationships to a third-party during the quarter.","Other expenses increased 72 million or 9% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth including strategic investments in our sales pipelines and our direct deposit program as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. Lastly, the efficiency ratio was 30.1%, nearly a 180 basis point improvement over the 31.9% ratio last year. The business continues to generate a significant degree of positive operating leverage.","I will move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trend. Net interest income was up 13% driven by the continued strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.2% up 26 basis points over last year. Compared to last year, there are few key drivers worth pointing out. First, we benefited from a slightly higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we are holding and have deployed excess liquidities to support our strong receivables growth.","The yield on receivables was up 15 basis points compared to the prior year. Revolve rate improved compared to the prior year, and we received a modest benefit from the increase in the prime rate over the past year. Lastly funding cost improved by two basis points driven by a slightly more favorable funding mix.","Our deposit base increased by $6 billion and with 72% of our funding sources versus 71% a year-ago. The cost of our deposit base is lower than our other funding sources, so the margin benefited from this shift and the funding mix to lower cost deposit. So overall we continue to be pleased with our net interest margin performance and given these trends we continue to expect the margin for the full-year to be between 16% and 16.25%.","Next, I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. As we have noted previously, we continue to anticipate credit will normalize from the levels we experienced over the past couple of years, we expect this normalization to occur overtime driven by a number of factors including the portfolio and channel mix, account maturation and seasoning, and consumer and payment behaviors.","In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I'll start with the delinquency trends. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.25% compared to 3.79% last year, and 90 plus delinquencies were 1.06% versus 1.67% last year.","Moving on to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.42%, compared to 4.51% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCO continues to be normalization. The second quarter of last year also included approximately 15 basis points of benefit from higher recoveries which did not repeat.","Given what we have seen so far, we expect NCOs to be in the low 5% range for 2017 with normalization being a key driver. This is consistent with what we noted last quarter. It\u2019s important to note that while NCO rate was 5.33% last quarter and 5.42% this quarter, we do see a fairly significant seasonal impact that typically results in a lower NCO levels in the third quarter.","The allowance to the loan losses is percent of receivables with 6.63% and the reserve build from the first quarter was 325 million in-line with our expectation. Looking forward, based on what we are seeing across the portfolio and assuming economic conditions are stable, our expectation continues to be a loss rate in the low to mid 5% range for 2018 with lot just trending somewhat higher into the first half of 2018 then starting to level off in the second half of the year. This is consistent with what we noted last quarter.","Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, given credit normalization and strong growth, we continue to believe the reserve build for the third quarter will likely be in a similar range on a dollar basis to what we saw in the first and second quarter of this year.","As we move into 2018, we expect that reserve build will transition to be more growth driven given our expectation that loses began to level off in the second half of 2018.","In summary, while credit will continue to normalize form here and impact our near-term operating results, we continue to see very good opportunities for continued growth and attractive risk adjusted return.","Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at 911 million up 9% over last year. Expenses continue to be mainly driven by growth and strategic investment. As I noted earlier efficiency ratio is 30.1% nearly 180 basis point improvement over last year as we continue to drive operating leverage in the core business.","Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as our capital plan we announced in May. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business.","Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by 6 billion, primarily to our direct deposit program. This puts deposit at 72% of our funding slightly higher than the 71% level were operating at last year.","We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capability. Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in-line with our receivables growth.","Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. We had two very successful debt transactions during the quarter, a 750 million five-year fixed rate senior note issuance and 822 million in ADS issuance, we saw strong demand on both transaction. In terms of our funding plan going forward. We will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix in 2017.","Funding through securitizations with 17% of our funding consistent with our target of 15% to 20%. Our third-party debt now total 11% of our funding sources within our 10% to 15% target. So overall, we saw very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources.","Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 17.4% CET1 under the transition rules and 17.2% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 18% on a fully phased-in basis last year reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our previous capital plans and growth.","Total liquidity was 21.9 billion, which is equal to 24% of our total assets. This is down from 25.5% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.","During the quarter, we completed the capital plan we announced last July and paid a common stock dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased 238 million of common stock fulfilling the 952 million in share purchases, our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2017.","In May, were pleased to announce our new capital plan through June 30, 2018. Our board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and a share repurchase program of up to 1.64 billion, which we began to execute in May repurchasing 200 million during the quarter in addition to the 238 million repurchase technically to prior program for a total of 438 million of repurchases in the second quarter.","This represented 15.7 million shares repurchased during the quarter slightly more than double what we have been averaging in the prior three quarters. We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions and acquired approvals. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously.","We have built a very strong balance sheet with diversify funding sources, a strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue deploying capital to the growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividend and share repurchases.","Before I conclude, I wanted to recap our current view on 2017. Given the strong receivables growth and higher revolve rates we\u2019ve seen so far this year, we continue to believe the margin for the full-year will be in the 16 to 16 and a quarter range, this demonstrates one of the natural offsets in the business, some are the same factors driving credit normalization also resolved in the higher receivables yield. So we are seeing a partially offset on the revenue line. We expect NCOs to be in the low-5% range for the full -year 2017 normalization will continue to be a largest factor.","Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, given credit normalization and strong growth; we continue to believe the reserves build for the third quarter will likely be in a similar range on a dollar basis to what we saw in the first and second quarter this year. As we move into 2018, we expect the reserve builds will transition to be more growth driven, given our expectation that losses will begin to level off in the second half of 2018.","We now think RSAs will run closer to 4% given the impact of reserve build and somewhat higher loyalty program expenses due to higher redemption expectations which are also shared with retailers through the RSA.","And while we continue to generate positive operating leverage, it is favorably impacting the efficiency ratio. We expect the efficiency ratio to run closer to 31.5% for the full-year. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business; however, this will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments as well as holiday marketing campaigns that run in the second half.","In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive long-term returns. Assuming economic conditions and the health of the consumer consistent going forward, our expectations that reserve builds will moderate into 2018 which combined with the continued growth of the business and the impact on the substantial increase in our share repurchase program will help us generate EPS growth in 2018.","Before I turn the call over to Margaret, I wanted to let you know that we will begin filing an 8-K showing our managed data for delinquencies, net charge-offs and end of period as well as average loan balances on a monthly basis.","For the last month of each quarter we will provide the monthly data in conjunction with the filing of our quarterly financial results. We will be filing the first 8-K with this data after the market closes today which will provide you historical monthly information dating back to January of 2015 you can see the monthly trend and in August we will start filing the 8-K in conjunction with our monthly Master Trust filing.","I know many of you will find this helpful. And with that, I will turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I will provide a quick wrap up and then we will open the call for Q&A. We continue to execute well on our strategic priorities, driving strong organic growth across each of our sales platforms, renewing several existing programs by also signing a new private label credit card program and launching a new co-brand program.","We continue to drive solid deposit growth in support of our business development. We are also pleased to have announced a meaningful increase in our capital return to shareholders through our new dividend and share repurchase program.","We remain focused on returning capital to shareholders, not only through dividends and share repurchases but also through the continued growth of our business, with a focus on maintaining strong returns and a solid balance sheet as we do so.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I would like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And we have our first question from Bill Carcache with Nomura. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. I wanted to ask if you guys could give a little bit more color on what is behind that change that we saw in loyalty rewards expense exceeding interchange this quarter and I had a couple of related follow-ups on that, but perhaps maybe we could start there.","Brian Doubles","Yes sure Bill this Brian. Look it is really isolated to one of our programs where we made a couple of changes to make it easier for our customers to redeem their rewards. We believe this is a positive for the consumer to drive more loyalty to the retailer, more visit, more purchases, it\u2019s going to drive incremental sales over the long run.","It is again isolated to the one program we highlighted about 34 million of that related to 2016 rewards in the first quarter of 2017. So when you factor in that change, our redemption rate for the total company now is running above 95%. So, even if we were to get to a 100% redemption across the board, when you factor in the RSA offset the future impact will be pretty small.","Bill Carcache","Got it, okay. So the redemption rate assumption is 95% even if that went to a 100% that\u2019s not - that would have a material impact?","Brian Doubles","It would not have a material impact, the impact would be pretty small just given there is an RSA offset as the partners share in those costs. The best way to think about this going forward, if you adjust for that $34 million in the quarter, loyalty as a percent of interchange was around a 100% and that\u2019s probably a good way to think about it going forward.","Bill Carcache","Okay, great and we have kind of spent a lot of time talking about that relationship RSAs and credit and hadn\u2019t necessarily been thinking about RSAs in relation to the reward expense as much, but it sounds like that is a permanent relationship, it\u2019s like loyalty resets permanently higher, I guess is a question is that reasonable to expect that the RSAs will also reset permanently lower?","Brian Doubles","That you know, again the RSAs I know keep the like to focus on the RSAs as an offset to credit, we have been pretty clear that the RSAs are really based on the entire P&L, so it includes revenue, it includes loyalty expense, it includes credit, and all that, a couple of cases it includes the reserve build, it includes expenses and so it really is a complete sharing of the entire profitability of the program and so, the RSAs that we saw adjustments to our estimate in the quarter absolutely ramped to the RSA and it was an offset there.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s great, very helpful. Thank you for taking my questions.","Brian Doubles","Yes thanks Bill.","Operator","We have our next question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great thanks. I guess first Brian you had mentioned that your expectations for credit losses are pretty much consistent with what you had said three months ago. You had shown us some vintage charge that showed that the second half of 2016 was performing better and can you kind of update that tell us how that\u2019s trending?","Brian Doubles","Yes, Moshe. We have only gone here a couple months past when we published us back in April, so I would say the vintages are performing very much in-line with our expectations, we are still seeing the benefit from the underwriting changes that we have made in the second half of 2016 flow through, so we still see that can have a 2016 vintage is better than the first half of 2016. And that\u2019s at least in part what is giving us some comfort that losses will start to level off in the back half of 2018.","The underwriting changes that we made in the second half of 2016 and that we have continue to make in the first half of 2017 those are largely going to benefit in the 2018 loss rates. So I would say based on an updated those vintage curves everything we are seeing is pretty much in-line with what we showed you in April.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. just to kind of follow-up on a similar theme, couple of other private label players City and ADS have reported recently. And seem to be, I guess, maybe get your sense as to whether, your results or kind of leading or lagging, because City had kind of taken up its expectation for credit losses, now as oppose to you guys which had kind of done that a few months back and the ADS had talk about some issues with respect to recovery, something that you had also addressed. So maybe just given that everybody is kind of looking at all of the peers, maybe could you put in context kind of the timing of your disclosures. I mean, do you feel like you have been ahead of those factors?","Brian Doubles","Yes, I think the general trends are all very similar as you look across issuers. I think credit normalization trends are consistent. But I do think, you are seeing a little bit of variation in terms of which quarter in particular summer starting to see or change our view on the go forward projection. So I think based on - and you can actually, if you go back over the past couple of years and you look at where issuers saw really strong growth, that will differ as well by issuers by a quarter or two.","For us, we saw really strong growth in 2015 for first half of 2016. And right now in 2017, we are working our way through the peak kind of loss rates for those vintages. Second half of 2016 will be maturing in the second half of 2018 and so that\u2019s where we will start to see the benefits on the underwriting changes we\u2019ve made. So it\u2019s hard to comment generally, I think the trends across all the issuers are very consistent. But I think everybody is seeing this materialize in maybe a different quarter.","Moshe Orenbuch","Perfect. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good morning. And thank for giving us the monthly data going forward. I guess, first question back on credit quality and maybe following on most of the questions. As far as recoveries are concern. What is the game plan going forward here, because ADS has talked about bringing all that stuff in-house? Could you maybe just talk about where you are at with the recovery game plan?","Brian Doubles","Yes. I would say recovery pricing was generally pretty stable this quarter. This is an area that we continue to watch pretty closely. I mentioned last quarter that we run regular analysis on these sales and we compare the results of the debt sales other methods of collecting on the account. So we are always making those trade-off and we are always trying to optimize different strategy.","If we start to see the pricing deteriorate further, we may pull back on some of these sales and collect on the accounts for other means but we haven\u2019t made a dramatic shift in our strategy and haven\u2019t reached that decision point yet. But it\u2019s something we evaluate every month internally.","Sanjay Sakhrani","I guess, following on that, maybe one other question is do you have the capacity to do all of the collections in-house or would that be another step-up in costs to build that out. And then just secondly on RSAs, they are obviously tracking below your guidance for the year and as we sort of calculate what the ROA needs to be, to get to the RSA level that you are guiding to. I mean that would probably represent a pretty decent step up in ROAs for the second half for the year. Is that the way to think about it, I mean it\u2019s like a 30 basis point pick-up in the ROA if I calculate it I think? Or is there something else that we should consider, when we are thinking about the RSA level that you are guiding to for the year? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, let me do the recovery one first. So on recoveries, we would go through a transition period. Day one, we wouldn\u2019t bring it all in-house. We would be thoughtful around how we manage that transition. Obviously there is a short-term implication, there is a long-term implication. You would be a step-up in cost as move some of that in-house or to other collection strategies. But if we felt like that we are getting a good return on our investment over the long-term that\u2019s something we would certainly consider. But we would have to build out some additional infrastructure and add some cost related to that.","On the RSAs, I think if you think about where we started the year, we were 3.7 last quarter, we are 3.6 this quarter. You really have to remember that the second half of the year we had a seasonal high, particularly had a seasonal high in the third quarter that typically coincides with the seasonal low point on net charge-off. So this just that dynamic alone as you move from the second into the third and then into the fourth quarter, RSA percentages come up. And we think that puts us back right around 4% for the full-year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe just a little bit more clarity on the credit outlook. So if my math were correct gross charge-offs are up roughly 70 bps in the first quarter and may be a little bit below that in the second quarter. As we look out through the back half of the year, should we expect that pace to continue and then some variability on the recoveries and when would you expect us to see the gross charge-offs begin to decelerate and maybe any color you can give us in terms of the 4Q build?","Brian Doubles","Yes, so Ryan. Look I think generally the trends like I said are in-line with our expectations. The one thing that you have to factor in, let\u2019s just talk about seasonality for a bit, we do see a fairly significant seasonal drop in NCOs in the third quarter. So you have to make sure that you are modeling that right. That\u2019s certainly included in our guidance. And then just well around the topic of seasonality its probably just worth a reminder that we also see a seasonal increase in delinquencies in the second half of the year.","So you just got to make sure that you are taking that all into account, but we feel pretty good about 2017. like I said this is a transition year. This is where we are kind of hitting the peak of the 2015 and first half of 2016 vintages. The underwriting changes that we have made are largely going to benefit 2018. And so that\u2019s really where we are focused.","The reserve build in the quarter gives you a fairly good indication that is in-line with our expectations and now we have picked up the first half of 2018, so that should give you some comfort that things are trending more or less in-line with what we expected.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Just as a quick follow-up I guess just on a year-over-year basis how should we expect it to trend? And then second just for the NIM, you are obviously running towards the high end of guidance and historically speaking we do see a pickup in the back half of the year as we see lower revenue suppression, an uptick in late fees. If you could maybe just clarify what are some of the offsetting factors that would cause you to not be above the 1625 on NIM? Thanks for taking my question.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. Look other than giving you the full-year and you\u2019ve got the first two quarters to work with, I think that should help you model the third quarter and the fourth quarter pretty closely. I think the thing I just reiterate is you got to factor in the seasonal decrease in the third quarter that comes back up in the fourth.","In terms of the margin, look we are very pleased with how we started the year. We are up 26 basis points over last year in the quarter. Receivable yield was up 15 basis points with stronger revolve rate, we got a benefit from the increase in the prime rate, we did have a partial offset from interest and fee reversals which you would expect to see in-line with credit normalization.","And then we have done I think a nice job optimizing the liquidity that we are holding on the balance sheet. As you think about the second half for the year, we do typically get a seasonal lift in yield in the second half for the year; however, there is going to be a couple offsets we think.","First, I think we will probably see slightly higher deposit betas than we have seen so far in the rate cycle. Nothing dramatic, but probably just a little bit higher than what we have seen so far in the first 100 basis points maybe a little more competition on rates in the second half.","And then I think we are also likely to get a little less benefit from higher revolve rate in the second half just getting some of the changes we made on underwriting. So think there will be some puts and takes but that probably puts us back between the 16, 16 and a quarter range for the full-year.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for the color Brian.","Operator","And our next question comes from Beth Lynn Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck","Hi, good morning. On just probably with [indiscernible] you mentioned slightly higher due to the revolve rate you said you expect given your changes that you have slightly lower revolve rate, could you just explain what changes you made to drive to that outcome?","Brian Doubles","Well the revolve rate tends to ebb and flow in-line with credit normalization, so we have seen a fairly substantial benefit on revolve rate starting in the second half of last year. We continue to see that through the first half and I think that will just moderate a bit heading into the second half of this year.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck","Okay, and then on the outlook for RSA, I know you had a couple conversations on this already, but question is coming into this quarter you indicated the reserve that you were looking for to hit that, that was great and expecting that reserve build again in 3Q. I understand that the credit improves in 3Q, but should we expect that that there is a like for like improvement in RSA even with what is going to be still a little bit higher reserve build in the third quarter or is there some cushion in the RSA outlook that you are giving us?","Brian Doubles","No, we started the year remember around 4.5%, we took it down last quarter to 4.1% to 4.2% and now we are staying around 4%. Part of that is a combination of what we are seeing on credit, plus the additional loyalty costs that we had in the quarter, those are really the two driver.","And then how you get from 3.6%, 3.7% range to 4% for the full-year is really seasonality. Go back over the last three years and you look at the increase from the second quarter to the third quarter and then into the fourth you always see an increase in the RSA, some of that is driven by lower net charge offs, some of that is program specific but that increase will be there in the third quarter and we think combination of those things puts us background 4% for the full-year.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck","Okay and then lastly, on the capital return and a dividend hike that you announced earlier this quarter, could you just give us a sense as to whether the timing of your decisions on capital returns has now changed going forward, should we expect that you are going to be making these kind of decisions shortly after second quarter is over timeframe or will you go back to releasing at the same time as the rest of the industry even though you are not CCAR required?","Brian Doubles","Yes I mean we were about a month early I think, we got through our process with our board and with our regulators and we were very pleased to be able to announce the capital plan when we did. We were able to take advantage some of that in the quarter. We repurchased about 200 million of the allotment in the quarter. So where we have a little bit of flexibility, we are trying to be opportunistic around that and we will continue to do that.","But I don\u2019t think, we are going to be much ahead of timing wise, what we announced this quarter. I think we are still following a very similar process, we are using the same scenarios that gets published early in the year. We run our models, we review it with obviously the Management Team, the Risk Committee and the Board. And our Regulators and this year that put us right around the May timeframe that\u2019s probably not a bad way to think about it going forward, but it could lag a month and we could be close sort of where the peers are in that.","Elizabeth Lynn Graseck","Right okay. All right, thanks a lot Brian.","Operator","And our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.","James Friedman","Hi. Brian I let you take breath and Margaret I was going to ask you couple of questions if I could.","Margaret Keane","Brian really appreciates that.","James Friedman","I was going to ask you about the Sy-Pi that you had mentioned at the outset. So where should we be seeing that show-up the most significantly, you mentioned a number of retailers that you have that have adopted it, I think you gave another volume based metric. But where in the financials, do you think that that will show up most significantly? And then I have one quick follow-up.","Margaret Keane","Sure. You will see that in growth in particularly kind of our mobile growth. So the way the Sy-Pi works, it\u2019s an App that easily integrates to the retailer\u2019s App that\u2019s why we call it plug-in. So it\u2019s very easy to the retailer to execute upon, because most of the work is on our side. And it integrates [indiscernible] so it\u2019s a very seamless smooth process for the customer as they are going through their process of credit and using their credit card and paying and all those types of things getting their reward. So you will see it in growth and our engagement from a mobile perspective just continues to grow and that\u2019s really where you will see that.","James Friedman","Okay. Is it fair that say that sort of technology maybe influencing the loyalty observation that you are making more company-wide, if it\u2019s easier to use your rewards people will?","Margaret Keane","Not necessary as Brian said there was one program in particular where we need to change. But I would say that in general, the way we think about loyalty is the real positive for us. So the more the customers are aware of the rewards. Our analytic show that if we get them to go back any unused reward, they tend to have a bigger basket and shop more. So for us this circular process of issuing rewards make it easy for the customer, having them go back into our partners to shop is a real class.","And as Brian said, the rewards are offset in RSA. So it\u2019s really a win-win for both of us. Right we are helping to generate sales for the customer this higher engagement of that customer with our retailer and in the recent environment we are in, anything we can do to make that customer more sticky is a real positive.","James Friedman","Okay. I just had one more. On the digital side, you gave that disclosure, 18% increase, I thought you said online. I get this question a lot is that because you happen to have one extremely prominent ecommerce retailer or is that more of an observation about wallet penetration throughout your retail base? Thank you.","Margaret Keane","It\u2019s more wallet penetration across our retail base. I would just generally say, I know everyone looks at the one retailer, but we have a lot of retailers who have online mobile capability and that\u2019s just an area with everything else is growing. So things like having Sy-Pi to help integrate through the App, as I dais we have 12 retailers already involved in that. We are going to continue roll out more, I think you are going to continue to see this be a big part of how customer shop.","James Friedman","Got it. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.","Richard Shane","Hey, guys. Actually Jamey\u2019s question was a pretty good segway. I know you are not going to comment too specifically, but can you help us think about any seasonal impacts that we might see in the third quarter results related to Amazon Prime Day, obviously it\u2019s a pretty significant event, I just want to make sure we understand how it runs through the numbers?","Margaret Keane","Sure. We can\u2019t really comment on one particular retailer. What I will tell you is that we initiated Amazon 5% off back in second quarter 2015. We are very pleased with the overall programs to-date. It continues a positive growth story for us. And you could read through Amazon had a great day. So we are very pleased with the partnership.","Brian Doubles","And you will see it in the third quarter.","Richard Shane","Such that might be impacted by that we should be thinking about?","Brian Doubles","No Rick I think.","Margaret Keane","No, we can\u2019t one partner.","Brian Doubles","Look it\u2019s, you will see whatever impact is there in the growth numbers for the company. But I would highlight that we are pretty diversified across all of our retail partners and its where that you would see even and I am as significant as Amazon Prime Day have a dramatic impact on our overall results.","Margaret Keane","We have some big partners in that.","Brian Doubles","Right.","Richard Shane","Okay. Thanks guys.","Operator","And our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just a couple of follow-up on credit. One, I know you don\u2019t provide loss data by product, but just curious Payment Solutions continues to be a fastest growing product, it\u2019s over 20% balances now, and those are obviously all promotional balances. Brian, as you look at overall normalization in your commentary about second half 2016 has been performing better than first half. Had there been any meaningful changes in the magnitude of promotions over the last 12, 18 months that maybe impacting the pace of normalization? Just trying to get a sense for whether or not those promotional balances are consisting of the typical interest rate period or whether there were any changes that have contributed to the pace of normalization?","Brian Doubles","Yes, no I wouldn\u2019t attribute it to promotional balances. We have seen strong growth in the Payment Solutions, but I would say the trends in Payment Solutions are similar to what we are seeing across the total company in terms of normalization.","The one thing I have pointed out in the past is we do underwrite differently by platform, so we are actually slightly more conservative in how we underwrite in Payment Solutions just given if you look at the margins there and the top-line yield, we are working with a little bit less there than we are in CareCredit and Retail Card.","So we underwrite a little more conservatively in Payment Solutions, given the margin in CareCredit we will underwrite a little bit deeper. CareCredit and Retail Card is fairly close to the average. So portfolio mix is absolutely a driver, but I would not attribute it to promotional balances.","David Scharf","Got it, that\u2019s helpful and then lastly just another quick question on the recovery side. In terms of the mix to the degree of that sales has risen in the last couple of years given pricing trends and those are reversing now has been discussed. How much of your recoveries are actually accomplished through the third channel which is outsource contingency collection, so much is focused on the debt sale side, but are you seeing - A, do use outsource collection agencies and B, are there any changes to the contingency fees, the pricing in that channel?","Brian Doubles","Yes, we do use third-parties as well, we try and optimize across all of the recoveries strategies in the various channels and like I said earlier, we are looking at that on a monthly basis. We have run champion challenger to see where we are getting the best results and we modify and adjust the strategies as we go. I would say the majority of the impact that we have seen has largely been attributable to the market pricing on the debt sales and lesser impact in other strategies.","David Scharf","Okay, got it. Thank you.","Operator","And our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. Brian I believe you indicated, we should expect to see a seasonal drop in charge-offs in 3Q and we certainly saw a significant drop in 2014 and 2015. But last year when delinquencies were actually rising which tends to mute seasonal improvements, you had a much smaller seasonal improvement in the third quarter, was there anything to call out in that that also outside of the rising delinquencies that might have dampened the seasonal improvement that are not present this year and would suggest another kind of large drop in 3Q?","Brian Doubles","Yes, it\u2019s a good question Mark. The one thing I would highlight, in the second quarter of 2016 we spiked out of 15 basis points of incremental recoveries that we had in the second quarter of 2016 which obviously didn\u2019t repeat it either in the third quarter of 2016 or repeat this quarter obviously. So that\u2019s one thing I would point to, so maybe take the second quarter of 2016 charge-offs up by 15 basis points and then you would see more of a seasonal decline as you move from the second quarter to the third quarter.","Mark DeVries","Okay, great that\u2019s helpful. And then second question, I mean it sounds like you guys have done some pretty meaningful tightening to give you some comfort and the guidance around losses leveling off in the half of last year, but we haven\u2019t really seen that reflected - the growth your loan growth so far. When if it all might we expect to see growth moderate as a result of some of the underwriting moves?","Brian Doubles","I think you are seeing I would say to some degree in the purchase volume, we have obviously tightened, we made incremental changes here in the first half, we do expect that to have a modest impact on growth, if you look at purchase volume we were right around 7% when you adjust for HHGregg this quarter versus a run rate that was probably closer to 9% or a little above 9%. So I think that\u2019s where you are seeing it.","We are not seeing it quite yet in the receivables still, because there is an offset on incremental revolve which is more of a consumer behavioral element that continues to drive good receivables growth. So we think there is still really good opportunities to continue to grow but I think, we are not seeing the same opportunities to grow that we saw in 2015 and at least in the first half of 2016. So I think, there will be a modest impact going forward. But generally as we look across the programs in the platforms, we are still seeing good growth opportunities that are attractive returns, just maybe not we are seeing couple of years ago.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Henry Coffey with Wedbush Securities.","Henry Coffey","Yes. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking my question. And, again, the monthly data is going to be extremely helpful for, so thanks for that step forward. When you talk to about rising net charge-offs, it seem to be either a geographical or channel component to it. There were certain spots to either the store mix or the country that we were struggling more than others. Now that you have had another quarter of looking at that. Can you really comment on two related things one that and two how is the dual purpose card holding up on the credit side?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure. We have highlighted for a number of quarters now that portfolio mix component as part of normalization. For us, as we talked about our underwriting is customized and we underwrite differently whether it\u2019s by platform, by program, we target different loss rates depending on the overall profitability of those programs.","So just depending on the growth rates in those different areas mix can certainly be a driver and that\u2019s mix by program, it can be mix by channel, it\u2019s really multi-variant, it\u2019s not as simple as just one program, one product, one retailer, it\u2019s a combination of factors.","And I would say, what we are seeing in that regard is largely in-line with our expectation. I wouldn\u2019t attribute it as much to a geographical slice or a geographical split that\u2019s driving, it really is more portfolio mix on our side. And then did you have a second question?","Henry Coffey","Yes. Just unrelated, but in terms of margin. I think one everybody heard about asset sensitivity, they were looking for fairly large boost though, now we are seeing fairly small boost. What is the real dynamic there, is it just timing or is it more of funding competitive issue?","Brian Doubles","Look, for us, yields and margins are ahead of our expectations so far this year. If you remember, when we started a year back in January, we guided to a net interest margin of 15.75 to 16. We took that up 90 days in. We now think we will be between 16, 16 and a quarter for the year. So we continue to be slightly asset sensitive, its right around 1% under 100 basis points shock. And that\u2019s been very consistent over the last three years. That 1% kind of range hasn\u2019t really moved much.","I do think as we get into the second half year that we may see a little more competition on deposit rate. We have seen just in the last four to six weeks, we have seen some competitors move. We have been very fortunate so far with the first 100 basis points. I think on our CDs and savings, I think we haven\u2019t moved more than 10 or 15 basis points across all those products.","So we have had a nice little lag her. The margins have improved as a result of it. But I do think the things will get a little more competitive and we are ready to respond to that if we have to.","Henry Coffey","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson.","Arren Cyganovich","Thank you. Just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the 2019 renewal with your retailers if you have started those discussions and if so how they have been progressing?","Margaret Keane","Yes, we really can\u2019t comment on what we have started or not started. But what I would say is we have to win every day, so part of the process we deal here is really making sure we are delivering for the customers and the retailers now. In many cases usually something will come up where the retailers wants to either change the value prop or expand in a certain way which will allow us the opportunities to open up the dialogue.","So we are constantly in those discussions and we feel pretty positive about the relationship that\u2019s are coming up. The relationships we have had for very, very long time. And we are hoping and confident that we will be able to renew those relationships.","Arren Cyganovich","Fair enough thanks. And then just from a modeling perspective, was the 34 million higher redemption rate that caused the loyalty - is it more of a one-time item, is that something that\u2019s going to be consistent going forward?","Brian Doubles","Yes, that\u2019s really more of a one-time item that related to 2016 rewards in first quarter 2017. And in terms of a run rate going forward, if you adjust that to 34 million and put loyalty as a percentage of interchange right around a 100% that\u2019s not a bad way to think about it going forward.","Arren Cyganovich","Thank you.","Greg Ketron","Vanessa, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Thanks very much guys. Margaret, you talked about the pipeline in the last question. I\u2019m wondering maybe can you give us kind of just a commentary on any changes I guess to competitive dynamics in the marketplace?","Margaret Keane","Yes, sure. I think competitors have been pretty stable as we have gone through this year. I would say, there is not many big deals out there. We tend to compete more on the $1 billion and below in that space, there is plenty of opportunity.","We continue to look at existing programs from competitors as well as start-ups. I think I have mentioned in the past we have dedicated resources in all three platforms. So we are feeling pretty good about the pipeline that we have in place and how we are winning and playing in marketplace.","We are not going to win every deal. We try to really work on the deals that we think meet our returns and are going to be accretive to our overall portfolio. And that\u2019s kind of how we have approached it and we will continue to approach. But I don\u2019t think anyone seeing particularly crazy out there in terms of competition.","John Hecht","Okay, thanks for the color. And then last question is, Brian you talked about deposit data in the second half, maybe just give a little bit more color on that in terms of your outlook and then where are you going on deposit duration just to give us a sense of the pricing changes?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure, John. Look I think our expectation is that any move in deposit pricing is going to be pretty modest. I just think it\u2019s been almost non-existent so far with the first 100 basis points that\u2019s going to be slightly above that. We have seen some competitors, we have to figure in a high yield savings with more attractive offers out there, whether it\u2019s the one-time bonus or slightly better rate than they have been offering, and I think we are going to have to step-up our pricing a little bit more in the second half than we did in the first half. But I\u2019m talking about basis points here, not a wholesale change from what we have been seeing.","John Hecht","And then duration, where are you guys trying to issue deposit at this point?","Brian Doubles","We have always tried to kind of match the duration of our assets with our liabilities that\u2019s part of our funding strategy. We have been very successful in growing the high yield savings book. I would say anywhere where we can grow the longer tenure CDs right now in this environment, we are looking to do that. Obviously given where rates are there is not a lot of demand for a five year CD, where they are priced today. So we are trying to take advantage of that where we can, there is just as not much demand there as we would like to see.","John Hecht","Great. Thanks for the color guys.","Brian Doubles","Yes.

Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today.","Before I get into the second quarter results, I'd like to outline some of the important changes we recently made at the executive level of the company. Brian Wenzel has been promoted to President. In this role, he is focused on accelerating key growth initiatives across the company deepening the integration of the key functions for which he is responsible. These include business strategy, venture investments and M&A, enterprise data analytics, marketing including digital platforms, customer experience and the expansion of the company's direct-to-consumer banking and product strategy.","Brian Wenzel succeeds Brian Doubles as CFO. Brian has successfully served as Deputy Chief Financial Officer for the past year and as Chief Financial Officer for our retail card platform for more than 12 years. His experience imparts a broad perspective of our operations and a deep understanding of our people and partners. He will continue to focus on execution of our long-term financial and growth objectives.","These changes underscore a dedication to our strategic priorities and drive to continue to grow and transform the business. I am proud of what these leaders have achieved thus far and I am confident that we have the right people in the right roles to lead us into the future. You will have an opportunity to hear from them today as Brian Doubles will cover our digital innovation and data analytics initiatives that are helping to drive growth. And Brian Wenzel will detail our financial results.","I'll begin by providing an overview of our second quarter accomplishments on Slide 3. Our progress continued in the second quarter as our focus on driving growth both organically and through new partner programs across each of our sales platforms helped deliver strong results. Earnings of 853 million or a $1.24 per share included a reduction in the reserve related to the expected sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio which positively impact the results by $0.27.","Loan receivables grew 4%, on a core basis excluding the Wal-Mart portfolio, loan receivables grew a strong 17%. Net interest income and purchase volume both grew double digits and average active accounts were up 9%.","Our efficiency ratio of 31.3% is in line with our expectations. This has been achieved as we on-boarded to Paypal program. And I'm pleased to report that our conversion was successfully completed during the quarter. We look forward to continuing to partner with Paypal to develop innovative solutions to grow the program successfully.","We have also continued to make investments in our Direct Deposit Program. During the quarter, we grew deposits 6.6 billion or 11% over last year and much of this growth has come through direct deposits. We also recently renewed and extended key relationships and launched a new program. In our payment solutions sales platform, we recently extended relationships with CCA Global Partners and Penske Automotive. We also added new programs with Samsung HDAC and Zero Motorcycles.","During the quarter, we also launched our new program with Fanatics, the global leader in license sports merchandise. Together we are leveraging our deep expertise in data analytics to deliver personalized shopping experiences and enhance loyalty for fans.","As you know a key strategic priority is to grow our network to great broader acceptance and utility of our cards. We have been particularly successful in doing that with our care credit network. This quarter we expanded our care credit network to include Lehigh Valley's physicians Group and the Baylor Scott White Medical Center in Sunnyvale Texas.","We also renewed our relationship with Bosley and launched our partnership with Lighthouse. We remained highly focused on the risk adjusted returns of our programs, operating with a strong balance sheet and returning capital to shareholders. During the quarter, we began executing our new capital plan which includes share repurchases of up to $4 billion in a planned increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share beginning in the third quarter. Overall, this is a strong quarter for us as we continue to make progress against our strategic initiatives growing both organically and via new programs.","Our investments in innovative digital technology, data analytics and seamless customer experiences are fundamental to our success. And Brian will outline some of those achievements shortly.","Before I turn it over to him, I'll spend a few minutes on our sales platform results on Slide 4. In retail card, strong results were driven by our PayPal credit program acquisition, which was largely offset by the reclassification of the Wal-Mart portfolio. Loans were up 2%, but excluding the Wal-Mart portfolio, they were up 23%. Interest and fees on loans increased 16% over last year and purchase volume grew 14%. Average active accounts were up 11%. We are happy to have completed the conversion of the PayPal portfolio.","This is a key relationship in the rapidly growing digital payment space and has expanded our capabilities within the merchant environment and through this partnership, we are providing an enhanced customer experience for thousands of merchants and consumers. We are very excited about the continued opportunities with this valued partner. We have worked hard to renew our relationships in the retail card space and have had great success in doing so. Currently 97% are retail card ongoing partner interest and fees on loans are under contract until 2022 and beyond.","Payment solutions also delivered another solid quarter. We generated broad based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishings and power that resulted in loan receivable growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased 6% primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 4% and average active accounts increased 3%. Our initiative to develop and extend the utility of our payment solutions network cards has yielded solid results.","We now have nearly 7 million cardholders in our Synchrony card care network with over 730,000 auto related locations nationwide where the card can be used. And we currently have approximately 5 million of Synchrony home cardholders that can use their cards at over 1 million locations. These networks along with other initiatives such as driving higher card reuse that now stands at approximately 30% of purchase volume excluding oil and gas have helped to drive growth and create significant opportunity for the future.","Card credit continues to generate solid growth, receivables growth of 7% was led by dental and veterinary specialties. Interest and fees on loans also increased 7% primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. Purchase volume was up 7% an average active accounts increased 5%.","With new partners on this quarter, we now have over 230,000 locations in the acceptance network and over 6 million active cardholders. We have significantly increased the network and utility of this card helping to drive the reuse rate to 54% of purchase volume in the second quarter.","We delivered solid growth across our sales platforms as we continue to extend relationships, increased card utility, expand networks and provide value added solutions to our partners and cardholders.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Doubles.","Brian Doubles","Thanks Margaret. Good morning everyone. I'll begin my comments today on Slide 5.","We have made significant investments to develop leading digital technologies, which have been essential to delivering a seamless customer experience and helped us to drive both organic growth and acquire new programs. The rise of e-commerce and digital shopping experiences has required innovation to ensure that programs work seamlessly across whatever channel a customer uses. That means that cardholders must have access to their cards, rewards and account information across all channels seamlessly. Innovations such as digital apply, digital servicing and Synchrony plug-in or SyPi and help to meet the ever evolving requirements of our partners and their customers.","Digital apply is a powerful tool for credit applications that we can configure to each partner. It is an adaptive and responsive user experience that integrates dynamic and intelligent presale to minimize the number of fields an applicant needs to enter and can pre-qualify known customers. It can also incorporate first purchase offers, coupons and incentives.","Our digital servicing platform provides quick and easy access to key account servicing functionality that is optimized for the mobile experience. We have also developed virtual assistant servicing capabilities and Amazon Alexa and Google Home. Cardholders can do things like check their balance or make a card payment. Synchrony plug-in or SyPi is another powerful innovation that can quickly and seamlessly be integrated into a partner's mobile approximately.","Through this platform, customers can apply for credit, service their account and check for and redeem earned rewards. These innovations are having meaningful impacts on our ability to grow our online mobile channels. The digital sales penetration for our retail card consumers has been growing. Digital sales penetration was 34% in the second quarter. Overall nearly 50% of our applications are happening online with the mobile channel alone growing 47% over the same quarter of last year.","Furthermore, we now have over 2 billion of payments being made to SyPi and 200% average annual growth in visits since we launched the platform in July of 2016. While these are significant achievements, we are continuing to make important investments to stay ahead of this evolving landscape. We're focused on meeting customers where they are with the features they need and conveniences they may not yet have contemplated.","Turning to Slide 6, as you know data and the ability to analyze and make it actionable has increasingly become an integral part of the success of our programs. We have developed an integrated data ecosystem that leverages a broad set of data assets from Synchrony, our retail partners and other external sources to transform customer experiences through personalized marketing, enhanced credit underwriting, optimized customer servicing and informed fraud strategies.","We are developing transformative, innovative data and analytic capabilities driven by customer behavior data, which will enable us and our partners to engage with customers more deeply than ever before. It empowers us to provide the right experience to the right channel at the right time. The value of data analytics has demonstrated on Slide 6 of today's presentation where examples are provided to illustrate how data analytics is having a direct impact on program results.","Through use of shared data and analytics we have been able to improve credit line assignments for certain partners best customers by 20% to 30%. This results in a better customer experience and drives more sales for our partners and at the same time provides improved economics for the program.","Also enhanced customer segmentation powered by data and advanced analytics techniques has proven to lead to a reduction of observed fraud rates, customer behavior scores are good predictors of fraud. Customers that have low engagement with our partners have the highest propensity for fraud as much as 70 to 90 higher.","Customer segmentation based on customer engagement with our partners also allows us to build more effective targeting and offer strategies for marketing campaigns. Increasing our campaign returns, while enhancing the customer experiences. These strategies help us drive increases in customer spending and higher account balances. Given the powerful results of data analytics, we will keep investing and it's an important component of our business focusing on new methods to leverage and activate integrated data assets to help drive program performance and enhance the user experience.","With that, I'll turn the call over to Brian Wenzel.","Brian Wenzel","Thanks Brian. I'll start in Slide 7 of the presentation. This morning we reported second quarter earnings of $853 million or $1.24 per diluted share. This included a reduction in the reserve related to expected sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio. The reduction totaled $247 million or $186 million after tax and provide an EPS benefit of $0.27 for the quarter. We generated strong year-over-year growth in a number of areas as noted on Slide 8. Excluding the Wal-Mart portfolio, loan receivables were up 17% interest, and fees on loan receivables were up 14% over last year reflecting the addition of the PayPal credit program last year.","We also continue to deliver solid organic growth. Overall, we're pleased with the growth we generate across the business as well as the risk adjusted returns on this growth. Purchase volume was 12% an average active accounts increased 9% over last year. RSA has increased $206 million or 32% from last year. Growth including the PayPal credit program acquisition and improve program performance drove the increase. RSA's has a percentage of receivables was 0.9% for the quarter inline with our expectations. We continue to expect RSA's as a percentage of average receivables to be in a 4.0 to 4.2 range for 2019, which I will cover in more detail later.","The provision for loan losses decreased $82 million or million, mainly driven by the reduction, the reserve related to the Wal-Mart portfolio partially offset by a core reserve build of $114 million in the quarter. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation ","Other expenses increased $84 million or 9% versus last year driven primarily by expenses related to the addition of PayPal Credit program. So, overall the company continued to generate strong results in the second quarter.","I will move to Slide 9, and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 11% driven primarily by the addition of the PayPal credit program and loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 15.75% compared to last year's margin of 15.33% which include the impact of the pre-funding for the PayPal credit program acquisition and was in line with our expectations.","We benefited from higher mix receivables as a percent of total earning assets compared to last year driven primarily by the PayPal Credit program acquisition and loan receivables growth.","Also impacting net interest margin was a decline in loan receivables yield and an increase in interest bearing liabilities cost. The loan receivables yield was 20.94% a decline of 9 basis points versus last year mainly due to the impact of the PayPal Credit program acquisition. The increase in total interest bearing liabilities cost was 49 basis points to 2.73% predominantly from higher benchmark rates.","We believe the net interest margin will continue to run in the 15.75% to 16% range for the year with normal seasonality and some potential fluctuation around the Wal-Mart portfolio sale later this year.","Next I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 10, in terms of specific dynamics in the quarter also with our delinquency trends. The 30 plus delinquency rate was 4.43% compared to 4.17% last year and the 90-plus delinquency rate was 2.16% versus 1.98% last year. The increase in delinquency rates was primarily due to the reclassification of approximately $8 billion in Wal-Mart loan receivables to held for sale.","The Wal-Mart consumer loan receivables that we expect to charge off prior to the expected portfolio sale remain in period end loan receivables which was approximately $400 million in loan receivables at quarter end. Given that we continue to report that delinquencies on the $400 million in end period loan receivables and a high percentage of these receivables are delinquent and represent the majority delinquent accounts in the Wal-Mart portfolio in total, the exclusion of the $8 billion and held for sale from period loan receivables skewed the reported rates higher.","Also impacting delinquency rate to the addition of the PayPal Credit program acquired in the third quarter of 2018. If you exclude the impact of the PayPal credit program and the Wal-Mart portfolio, the 30-plus delinquency rate improved by approximately 10 basis points and then 90 plus delinquency rate improved by approximately 5 basis points compared to last year reflecting stabilizing credit trends.","Moving on to net charge offs. The net charge off rate was 6.10% compared to 5.97% last year and 6.06% last quarter and was somewhat lower than expectations due mainly to higher recovery levels. We had expected net charge offs to trend 20 to 30 basis points higher in the second quarter compared to the first quarter. The recovery rate as a percentage of average receivables was 1.2% for the quarter and we had expected that rate closer to 1%. We had reported in prior quarters looking back to 2018.","While credit trends continue to improve, this was partially offset by the impact from the addition of the PayPal Credit program. Excluding the impact of the PayPal credit program and the Wal-Mart portfolio, net charge off rate was down approximately 5 basis points compared to last year. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.0% and a core reserve bill in the second quarter was $114 million excluding the impact from the reduction in reserves related to the Wal-Mart portfolio and in line with our expectations.","Looking forward, we expect the core reserve build for the third quarter will be in $175 million range. This is higher than the second quarter due to an expected acceleration in loan receivable growth and the normal seasonality we see in the third quarter. Consistent with the outlook we provided in January, we expect to see some degree of acceleration in core loan receivables growth in the second half of this year. After taking into account that starting in the third quarter, we'll be comparing the period last year that include the PayPal Credit program. The acceleration in growth reflects the opportunities we have in the fast growing digital space as well as the diminishing impact on growth from declining sides of the Wal-Mart portfolio that remains and held for investment.","Regarding future reductions in the loan loss reserve associated with the Wal-Mart portfolio. We now expect the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio will be completed in October. The remaining loan loss reserves held against the portfolio was approximately $350 million at the end of the second quarter. We expect the reduction in the reserve will be around $250 million in the third quarter with the remaining reduction occurring in the fourth quarter when the portfolio was sold.","Regarding net charge offs. The third quarter net charge-off rate tends to be seasonally lower than the second quarter. The credit related purchase accounting impact from the PayPal Credit program acquisition in July of last year was also a significant driver and 100 basis point decline in net charge offs in the third quarter from the second quarter of last year. We expect the decline to be more modest this year and more in line with historical declines of 40 to 50 basis points from the second quarter. This is in line with our expectations and included in our 2019 net charge-off outlook. We continue expect net charge offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with the slight increase entirely driven by the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio partially offset by the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio later this year. Excluding the effects of PayPal and Wal-Mart, net charge-off rate was expected to be similar to 2018.","Before I wrap up discussion on credit trends, I want to give you some visibility on our initial thoughts around the implementation of CSO beginning in 2020. We are finalizing our assumptions with alternatives that remain under evaluation and we are still analyzing a number of factors for potential inclusion or exclusion based on the predictive capabilities over time. We have commenced parallel testing on our core model and our models are undergoing validation testing. We also continue to work with and obtain feedback from regulators.","While these key factors remain open based on our current view our preliminary estimate from the initial impact would have been 50% to 60% increase in the total allowance for loan losses compared to what we have reported at the end of the second quarter. [Indiscernible] impact will depend upon the composition and asset quality of the portfolio, the economic conditions and forecasts upon adoption in addition to the factors I noted previously.","In summary credit trends have leveled off and are showing improvement in line with our expectations and we expect the trends to continue to show [stay low] [ph] as we move forward assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth and attractive risk adjusted returns.","Moving to Slide 11, I'll cover expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $1.1 billion up 9% over last year and we're primarily driven by the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program. Year-to-date expenses are up 7%. We do expect the expense growth rate to slow in the second half of this year due to the following factors.","First, beginning with the third quarter, we'll begin comparing against quarters post the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio. In addition to this, will be the favorable impact on expenses after the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio later this year. The efficiency ratio was 31.3% for the quarter here last year level and in line with expectations.","Moving to Slide 12, over the last year we've grown our deposits $6.6 billion or 11% primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 75% of our funding compared to 73% last year. In June, we issued $850 million in secured debt out of our Synchrony Card Issuance Trust. The issuance has a three year-term with a fixed rate of 2.34% that strong demand and were significantly oversubscribed.","Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 14.3% CET1 under the fully phased in Basel 3 rules. This compares to 16.3% on a fully phased in basis last year reflecting the impact of the capital deployment through the acquisition of the PayPal Credit program, organic growth and continued execution of our capital plans.","On May 9, we are pleased to announce our new capital plan through June 30, 2020. Our Board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.22 per share commencing in the third quarter and share repurchase program of up to $4 billion, which includes the capital freed up from the expected sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio. We began to execute our new plan in May repurchasing shares totaling $725 million during the second quarter. This represented 21.1 million shares repurchased during the quarter.","Total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was $23.7 billion which equate to 22.3% of our total assets. This is down from over 28% last year reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity for the PayPal Credit program acquisition.","Overall, we continue to execute the strategy that we outlined previously. We're committed to maintaining a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue to deploy capital through the growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Before I conclude, I wanted to recap our current view for the third quarter and the year. Overall, the net interest margin performed in line with our expectations for the second quarter. We believe the net interest margin will continue to run at 15.75% to 16% range for the year with the normal seasonality as well as some potential fluctuation around the Wal-Mart portfolio sale later this year.","RSA as a percentage of average receivables were 3.9% for the quarter in line with our expectations. We continued to expect the RSA percent to be in the 4.0% to 4.2% range for 2019. Regarding credit we expect the core reserve bill for the third quarter to be largely driven by growth in a normal seasonality we see in the third quarter and we'll be in $175 million range.","We now expect to sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio to be completed in October. The remaining loan loss reserve held against the portfolio was approximately $350 million at the end of the second quarter. We expect a reduction in the reserve to be round $250 million in the third quarter with the remaining reduction occurring in the fourth quarter when the portfolio was sold. We still expect net charge offs for 2019 will be in the 5.7% to 5.9% range with the slight increase over 2018 entirely driven by the impact from the PayPal Credit portfolio partially offset by the sale of the Wal-Mart portfolio later this year. Excluding effects of PayPal and Wal-Mart the net charge-off rate is expected to be similar to 2018. The third quarter net charge-off rate tends to be seasonally lower than the second quarter.","The decline from last year's second quarter to the third quarter of 100 basis points was also driven by the credit related purchase accounting impact from the PayPal Credit program acquisition. We expect the decline to be more modest this year and more in line with historical trends of 40 to 50 basis points.","Turning to expenses, we continue to generate positive operating leverage and still expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year.","In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive risk adjusted returns.","I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And from Credit Suisse we have Moshe Orenbuch. Please go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Can you hear me? Can you hear me?","Margaret Keane","Yes. All right.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks. Sorry about that. So I guess maybe the -- given that you're now pretty close to transitioning out of Wal-Mart and talking about the potential for acceleration in organic loan growth. Could you talk about how PayPal figures into that? I mean that relationship was growing probably 25% or 30% before and has the potential to expand significantly through and so talk about how you're thinking about that as a vehicle for driving overall loan growth?","Margaret Keane","Yes. So far, the first thing that's really great that we've completed the conversion which was a fairly significant sized conversion for us and that went really seamlessly which we're really excited about. And I think now we can refocus our attention on a list of initiatives we have that really are targeted to drive growth for the program. I think we have our teams working closely together, I would say it's a really strong partnership and we're really working on both technology enhancements as well as program enhancements to really be even more integrated as we go into the marketplace and really work with the merchant base of PayPal, so we see this as a big part of our growth story going forward.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great thanks. And maybe switching gears just a little bit despite getting a late start during the quarter you were able to buyback over $700 million worth of the stock. I mean are you looking to kind of continue at a similar pace. Like how should we think about the deployment of that 4 billion?","Brian Doubles","Great. Thanks Moshe. The way I would think about it is, you have a core capital return plan based upon our earnings. If you look at how the Wal-Mart capital gets freed up we had $522 million of reserves which released in the first quarter, $247 million in the second quarter. We've guided to $250 million in third and $100 million in the fourth. When you tax effect that and then look at the capital it gets released upon the portfolio conveyance in the fourth quarter that's kind of how you should think about how capital gets freed up and the gains you can think about for 2019.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","From Jefferies we have John Hecht. Please go ahead.","John Hecht","Thanks very much guys. You guys spent a bit more time talking about digital innovation and that kind of greater activity from online activity and Internet-based activity. I'm wondering just at a high level over time should we expect that to reduce customer acquisition costs or servicing costs.","Brian Wenzel","Yes, John. Hey, this is Brian. Yes, absolutely. I think this is an area that continues to be a real strength for us. It's an area that we've been investing pretty heavily in over -- really the last five years. I think it's -- if you look at our investment in pay phone, our acquisition of GPShopper. We're now getting 50% of our apps through the digital channel.","If you look at mobile we've seen 47% growth year-over-year really good online sales penetration at retail card, it's about 3x the national average. And so, as we think about it it's really -- its acquisition all the way through servicing and paying your bill.","And so, part of this is clearly an efficiency play. We love the fact that customers can apply for credit. It reduces our acquisition costs all the way to the back-end making a payment and not having to call somebody in customer service. But I think if you look even beyond that. This is really helping us drive organic growth, but also helping us when new programs, so it's a real differentiator for us.","John Hecht","Okay. That's helpful. Thanks. I guess you guys are the first card company to give this quarter -- to give some a little bit more detailed guidance around CESO. I'm wondering within the guidance you gave us out of curiosity as much as anything is that you what's the duration that I guess in the different portfolios you have that they assigned or that you assigned?","Brian Wenzel","Yes. Thanks John. We really can't get into too much detail around some of those assumptions. Obviously, we are primarily a card based company. We have some commercial products, but again, we're working through those assumptions now going through the various constituencies we have where there are accounts or participants in and when we generally believe we're in line with other card issuers.","John Hecht","Understood. Thank you guys very much.","Brian Wenzel","Thanks John.","Operator","From JPMorgan, we have Rick Shane. Please go ahead.","Rick Shane","Hey guys. Thank you for taking my questions this morning. And congratulations Brian and Brian on your respective new role. When I look at the sort of preliminary work on CESO that suggests, if you were to implement today a CET11 in the high 11, low 12 type range please correct me if you think I'm wrong there. But, I am curious given that this is a lot of geography how you will look at your CET1 targets going forward and will you consider lowering those targets?","Brian Wenzel","Yes. Thank you. The first thing I'd say is that, obviously the range we announced this morning doesn't really impact our capital plan. First of all for [Technical Difficulty] going through the period 2020. As we think about capital, the posting of these additional reserves really, really creates additional loss absorption capacity which reduces our unexpected buffer really in the capital range. So when we think about it, we obviously believe that we should get credit for posting these losses and really reduce our capital threshold or CET1 threshold. That's discussions we've begun to have with our regulators and work out over time. But again, this loss absorption capacity is being built through the posting of reserves should allow us to lower this CET1 ultimately over time is our belief.","Rick Shane","And we certainly agree. I'm curious you've mentioned that you're in conversations with the regulators the other constituent there would be the rating agencies what are they say?","Brian Wenzel","Our discussion with the rating agencies preliminarily has been that they don't believe CESO is really a credit event. They understand the loss absorption capacity. We're familiar with their models and we're in discussions with them as well about how we think about the additional buffer that's put in by posting these reserves upfront. So, we are engaged with both of our agencies.","Rick Shane","Sure. Thank you so much.","Brian Doubles","Thank you.","Operator","From Goldman Sachs we have Ryan Nash. Please go ahead.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning guys.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Ryan Nash","Maybe I can ask a question on the 175 million of reserve build that you're expecting in the third quarter. Should we think about that as a new run rate as growth improves? And I guess related to that historically when you talked about a 150 million to 200 million of core reserve built, you were growing in the 8% to 9% range. Is that how we should maybe think about where loan growth could be headed over time? Thanks.","Brian Wenzel","Great. Thank you. The way I think about it is, our reserves going forward should primarily be growth driven. What we see as we look into the back half of this year, we see an acceleration of growth as we move forward [Technical Difficulty] stable growth of 3% the first quarter, 4% in the second quarter. We guided to 5% to 7% range and we expect that growth to accelerate in the back half of the year really through all of our programs and platforms. We're seeing terrific growth out of our payment solutions platform through the expansion of the auto and home network there. Through care credit and the broader acceptance is happening there as well as Brian has kind of highlighted some of our fast growing digital channels. So we do see an acceleration in the back half of the year in growth. And again, the reserve should be primarily growth driven as we move forward.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And then, maybe if I can ask a follow up on Rick's question regarding CESO. So, you obviously have several years for the implementation just wanted to get a sense for when you think about capital return going forward, how you think about the ability to use the three year phase in? Thanks.","Brian Wenzel","Yes. You are right. The capital impact would be phased in over three years as part of our capital is going to originate through regulators we incorporated our initial estimate of CESO into that and we will continue to work with them. With regard to how that's treated again, we think about it as building losses absorption capacity and our CET1 rate should come down over time and be in line with peers first of all. But, taking account the fact that we're posting these higher reserves.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for taking my question. Thank you.","Operator","From Nomura we have Bill Carcache. Please go ahead.","Bill Carcache","Hi. Good morning. Sorry if I missed this but my first question is for Brian Wenzel. Hey, Brian, can you discuss how we should be thinking about the impact of a more accommodative Fed and maybe any color that you can give us on the impact of each 25 basis point cut?","Brian Wenzel","Yes. Thank you. Let me start with the second one as far as the interest rate environment. Obviously, we know what's modeled out there today which is a forecast of three movements. We have done several models and scenarios where we've looked at the impact of rates on our business. And generally when you think about our business or assets and liabilities are fairly well-matched against each other. And we really try not to take exposure to rates. So we're fairly balanced whether it's a rising rate environment or declining rate environment. So, when we look at those models that we've done, we're fairly comfortable or comfortable with that. The net interest margin for the year will be in the 15.75% to 16% range. And then we've had the ability really to manage our retail deposits and CD business. And we've lowered rates on CDs 5x since April this year with lower high yield savings really relating to the competition of the market and where the interest rate forecast is going. So we felt comfortable that we can deliver on our net interest margin again given our balance sheet we're not really exposed to interest rate movements.","With regard to the accommodative Fed, we obviously work with them on CESO and capital, they obviously know there's a large transition that's going on in the market for participants and they understand that I think are going to be fairly flexible in the short term.","Bill Carcache","That's great. Thank you. Separately I had another question for Brian Doubles. Thanks Brian for the new slides and the commentary on the impact of digital innovation on your growth. There's been a lot of focus on the digital investments that some of your less efficient competitors are making for example in public cloud technology. Can you give us a sense of how to think about the impact of your digital investments on your operating efficiency over time, is there room for your digital investments to benefit both the numerator and the denominator of your efficiency ratio such that we can expect further improvements from your already industry leading levels. Any color on that would be great. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure, Bill. I mean absolutely I think we view digital as a big initiative for us both in terms of driving growth, driving revenue for our partners. Again, existing partners but also winning new relationships. And every time we win a new relationship obviously given our scale, we get real efficiencies and real operating leverage there. But, then if you look at everything that one of our customers does through a digital channel saves us money. It saves us money the more we're able to move towards e-statements and people checking their statements on either in the app or online whether they're making payments through the app and we have now over 2 billion of payments that are coming through our SyPi apps. I think these are all things that drive real efficiency for the company. So I would absolutely think about it as driving both top-line growth, revenue growth as well as operating efficiency.","Bill Carcache","It's very helpful. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Thanks Bill.","Operator","From Wells Fargo we have Don Fandetti. Please go ahead.","Don Fandetti","Hey, good morning. So, Brian..","Margaret Keane","Good morning, Don.","Don Fandetti","Thank you. So on the NIM, I think in the last quarter you said that NIM would be down slightly in Q2. It feels like it's down a little more than that but you've mentioned it's in line with your internals, it kind of maybe a tiny bit towards the lower end of your internal or is it just bouncing around? And then I have a credit question.","Brian Doubles","Yes. The net margin was right where we expected to be in line with expectations. As they move sequentially, there was a decline in [indiscernible] which is primarily related to the acquisition of the PayPal Credit portfolio, a slight shift in the [indiscernible] with our loan receivables down 50 basis points versus the first quarter and then nine basis points of pressure from our interest expense. So again, it was in line with where we thought it would be and for the year, again we still expect 15.75% to 16%.","Don Fandetti","Okay. And then, I think Synchrony is largely through their underwriting adjustments that started back in 2015 or '16. But if take those mixed signals out in the card business right now at least in general purpose you have companies like JPMorgan accelerating growth CapitalOne raising, potentially raising lines. Within private label, what are you seeing competitors do in terms of underwriting tightening and do you think that the industry is actually shifting to a little bit more of an aggressive card lending sort of positioning overall.","Brian Doubles","Yes. I can't really speak for what others are doing in the industry what I would say is, we made some refinements back in the '16 and '17 timeframe. We make refinements every day based upon what we see in the portfolios and channels that we operate in. We are not I'd say making significant changes either opening the credit throttle or closing the credit throttle and we are operating the portfolio. And I think you can see through our results when you look at 30 plus and 90 plus delinquencies ex PayPal and Wal-Mart being deep down year-over-year that we see stabilizing [Technical Difficulty]. So, we're not in a position where we're going to take actions either way as we move forward here. So we're comfortable with credit how it is performing, the vintages as we look at them, the 17, I'm sorry, the 18 vintage is performing in line and back to almost the '16 or '15 vintage and the early results on our '19 vintage are in line with '18. So, we're comfortable with where credit is at and we're not taking any significant changes.","Don Fandetti","Okay. And then on the recoveries, are you seeing better pricing or was this just kind of like a bulk sale, a little bit of color on the higher recoveries. I know they can bounce around quarter-to-quarter.","Brian Wenzel","Recoveries again this quarter was 1.2% of our average loan receivables, so better than we expected and what we guided to really from the first quarter. And we're seeing that one we are seeing better pricing across most of our channels. We're seeing greater demand from the participants in the marketplace. So obviously, we were a little bit more opportunistic as I think about the first half of the year. But, I'd say overall recovery outside of those onetime transactions and flow arrangements recoveries, the results and performance is better than our expectations.","Don Fandetti","Thanks Brian.","Brian Wenzel","Thank you.","Operator","From Morgan Stanley we have Betsy Graseck. Please go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Question on -- I just wanted to understand a bit about PayPal. I know you've very nicely carved out the NCO x PayPal and Wal-Mart and just then also the loan growth outlook. I'm just looking to understand as we think about your go-to-market strategy with PayPal because I would think that this is a portfolio that has opportunity for a significant loan growth and spend growth. And just wanted to understand how you're toggling that with the credit side.","Margaret Keane","Yes. We work closely with PayPal in terms of how we're building out this global strategies with them. And they're pretty sophisticated on the credit side. So, I think we're going to approach this in a thoughtful way. And as Brian said, there's no plans to just open up the throttle in any way or treat PayPal any differently than our other portfolios and the environment we're in right now. But, I can say that the integration of two of us how we think about marketing and really the -- a lot of the growth that really is important on the digital front is really around placement and offers. And I think PayPal is really good at this and we're working very closely with them to make sure we're offering the credit in the right places. And that really makes a big difference in terms of the quality of the customer that you get in and your ability to approve accounts.","Brian Wenzel","The only thing I would probably add to that is, while PayPal operates at a slightly higher net charge off rate than the portfolio itself, the risk adjusted margin and the returns that we get of that portfolio really compensate for that. And again, when you contemplate that relative issue Wal-Mart [indiscernible] this year obviously from a credit perspective, we're better off as a company.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. No, definitely, I'm just thinking also that obviously this is a mobile online customers that and as a result think that that generates a little bit higher rev growth overall. Is that accurate?","Margaret Keane","Yes. It's a fast growing payment platform I would say.","Betsy Graseck","And then just a follow question is regarding the outlook for capital I know you touched on it earlier, but if we've got the Fed coming out with this tailoring rule and you guys don't even have to do CESO, I know you opt-in in your own way. But when you read the tea leaves of what's going on with how the Fed is thinking about the SCB and how it's thinking about the tailoring rule, should we be anticipating that you can have a lower starting point for what your stress levels of capital are or does that some of these new portfolios change that and say well that's an offset so we should still be running at the capital levels that we've been talking about.","Brian Wenzel","Yes. So only just clarifying, I wish we say we can opt-in as [indiscernible] unfortunately that is a requirement for us. As I think about capital as we move forward here, obviously we're very comfortable with the resiliency of the earnings of our business the way in which performs the returns of our business as well as offsets and we look at that. And then begin to look at the impact of CESO, we believe that we're going able to drive down our CET1 ratio because right now we're in excess of peers. We're migrating down when we started a number of years ago at 18% down. We believe we'll be able to be in line with our peers over the long-term. So, we don't really expect an impact from those rules on us.","Betsy Graseck","Eleven-ish or something like that is really where peers are kind of triangulating too. So that's what makes sense for you.","Brian Wenzel","Yes. I can't comment exact long-term target, but again we are working to get in line with our peers, given the profile of our business that's where we think we should operate. And that's the discussions that we're having with them.","Betsy Graseck","Yes. Now, I get that okay. And so if the Fed is kind of like migrating a little bit even lighter with the tailoring rule et cetera, you'll just follow the path on that?","Brian Wenzel","Obviously as the rules come out we'll assess them and engage in dialogue and be compliant with them. So again, we'll be nimble.","Betsy Graseck","All right. Thanks Brian.","Brian Wenzel","Thank you.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks Margaret.","Operator","From KSP Research, we have Kevin St. Pierre. Please go ahead.","Kevin St. Pierre","Hi. Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning, Kevin.","Kevin St. Pierre","Brian, I'd just like to better understand the 17 basis point decline into average credit card yields in the quarter. You touched on it a moment ago, but I just wanted to dig into that. Is it mixed a bit low or moderate, what drove that?","Brian Wenzel","Yes. So, when you look at it we are seeing a slightly higher revolve rate in the core business and some of the impact again of the interest rates movement is moving into the portfolio. The yield decline is solely related to where the majority of is related to the impact of the PayPal Credit portfolio that comes in at a lower yield. But again, we took pricing actions last year on the portfolio. They begun to take effect into the book but they take a long time under new [Kodak] [ph] rules and we expect that to be fully in a run rate basis in 2020. So it's really the acquisition of PayPal Credit that's driving the decline.","Kevin St. Pierre","Got it. Thanks. And then as a follow up. In terms of expenses and particularly marketing and business development maybe it's just me watching too much golf and tennis, but I've certainly noticed a big increase in the commercials and the advertising. Where should we think that line item goes over time?","Brian Wenzel","Yes. Again, our marketing and business development line that will fluctuate a little bit with regard to campaigns when we do reissuances, we relaunch value proposition. So there is some variability with that. We are not a big spender in commercials things like that. We've done some things in order to position our brand externally -- but that's -- we're not going to migrate into other peers, it's been tens of millions, hundreds of millions of dollars into that it's just more thoughtful branding. Again, we expect that to grow generally in line with their volume and loan receivable growth.","Kevin St. Pierre","Great. Thank you.","Brian Wenzel","Thank you.","Operator","And our last question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. Please go ahead.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Good morning. I guess Brian, I wanted to follow up on the NIM and the yield trajectory. You mentioned the PayPal repricing. As we look to next year, is it safe to assume that all else equal. I know rates might move around a little bit and that might affect your assets, but the trend is higher on the yield because of the repricing tailwind that you have related to PayPal? And then, secondly, similar question on expenses, I think I heard you say that expenses have been elevated related to PayPal and Wal-Mart as we think through some of the exit run rate into next year for the efficiency ratio. Should that be also a good guy for the efficiency ratio as we move into next year as you don't have those costs in the run rate.","Brian Wenzel","Yes. So let me deal with your margin question first, Sanjay. As we kind of go in there, we will obviously get the run rate of PayPal from the CIT come in. We're not providing today's specific guidance as it relates to 2020 as we'll do that in January as part of a more comprehensive look. The biggest change obviously is Wal-Mart portfolio coming out which operates at a higher net interest margin relative to its losses. So there will be some effect there, we'll provide more guidance to you in January with regard to the trends and we'll certainly have greater visibility to work through interest rate environments doing.","With regard to expenses again, we're projecting 31% or going to 31% for the year. We're very comfortable with that. As you think about going into 2020 again we'll provide guidance on that. Obviously, we've converted from an interim servicing basis this quarter from PayPal to us so there's be some line item shifts that happen in there. So that will be fully in the run rate.","And again, we started to implement some of the Wal-Mart cost out and be any part of the year for some of the fixed costs. In the back half of the year particularly in the fourth quarter, you'll see the variable costs come out, now we'll get into the run rate as we move into 2020.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. My follow up question for Margaret is just simply on the micro competitive environment. One of your peers talked about the online players being a bit more competitive in the market. I think I've heard you guys talk about it as well maybe you could just flush that discussion out and just talk about the pipeline going forward. I know you're absorbing quite a big deal right now, but as we look to the pipeline of future deals how does that look.","Margaret Keane","Yes. I would say we're excited about where the businesses position right now and we do feel like we're winning because of our digital capability, our data analytics capability and some of the things we continue to build out. I would say there's not a lot of big deals out there Sanjay. A couple of big deals maybe in the next two, three years will come up, but our pipeline and all three platforms is pretty robust. And what we're trying to make sure we do is ensure we're winning the deals that meet the returns that we're comfortable with. But I think there's enough out there that we feel confident that we can win both existing portfolios and startups.","Sanjay Sakhrani","All right, great. Thank you.","Greg Ketron","Thanks for joining us on the call this morning. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day.","Operator","Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you for joining.

My name is Vanessa, and I will be your operator for today\u2019s call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, operator. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us.","In addition to today\u2019s press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.","Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company\u2019s performance.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. We ended 2017 with a solid fourth quarter, which sets the foundation for 2018. Tax reform had an impact on our reported fourth quarter results, which Brian will cover later in the call. We expect to realize significant benefit from tax reform and we will look to utilize this benefit in a way that drives value for our shareholders, employees and communities.","I\u2019m going to spend my time today covering our business highlights, including the expansion of the strategic credit relationship with PayPal, as well as what we achieved in 2017, and I will end with our strategic priorities. Brian will detail our financial results and our outlook for 2018 later in the call.","A very significant and exciting development in the fourth quarter was the agreement we announced with PayPal to significantly expand and extend our strategic consumer credit relationship. In addition to extending our co-branded consumer credit card program with PayPal, we will now become the exclusive issuer of the PayPal Credit online consumer financing program in the U.S.","This will consolidate PayPal\u2019s two U.S. credit offerings under one relationship, which we extended with PayPal for 10 years. As part of this transaction, we will be acquiring PayPal\u2019s U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio, as well as interest held by other investors. We expect the transaction to close in the third quarter of this year.","Moving forward with PayPal to become the exclusive issuer of PayPal Credit in the U.S. is a natural extension of our successful 13-year relationship. The extended program offers tremendous benefits for both Synchrony and PayPal. Together, we can deliver best-in-class experiences for credit customers.","Combining our program management, credit capabilities and balance sheet with PayPal\u2019s data and risk platform and trusted brand as a leader in digital and mobile payment experiences should help create superior products and offerings for consumers and merchants.","The two programs require our unique organizational focus, given that they address different customer needs, rewards for co-brand and financing for PayPal Credit two areas in which we have expertise. Also, having one partner to holistically manage both of these programs for PayPal will allow for synergies and could provide opportunities for migrating customers between products as their needs change.","Our strategy will focus on optimizing three main components to drive sustained growth: the consumer value proposition, merchant differentiation and world-class digital customer experience to support ongoing engagement. This expanded relationship supports our continued reach within the rapidly growing digital payments channel. We have built a strong reputation in this space and this program will allow us to meet evolving consumer needs.","We primarily compete on our capabilities, including our significant experience, scale, dedicated teams, data analytics, loyalty programs, digital capabilities and proven record of providing value-added services to our partners. These capabilities all played an important role in expanding our relationship with PayPal.","We have a long history and have worked closely with them during our tenure to develop innovative and effective products and value propositions for PayPal\u2019s customers. We are obviously very pleased to be extending this important relationship as we jointly leverage the new opportunities to significantly grow this program.","During the fourth quarter, we renewed several relationships, including Men\u2019s Wearhouse and Retail Card, Home Furnishings Association, Husqvarna Viking, and Sweetwater and Payment Solutions and Bosley and Sono Bello and CareCredit. This was obviously a very productive quarter for us and we are pleased to continue to generate growth, both organically and through the launch of new innovative programs with exciting new partnership.","Before I pass the call over to Brian to get details on our financial results for the quarter and our outlook for 2018, I\u2019d like to provide a recap of the substantial progress we made on our strategic priorities in 2017. Growing our business remains a top priority. And in 2017, we achieved this through organic growth, new deals and the renewal of several key partnerships.","We are driving organic growth through digital innovation, data analytics and innovative marketing, promotions and value propositions on several of our cards. We had a very successful year in renewing more than 15 key relationships and winning more than 20 new deals in our three sales platforms.","We continue to pursue new opportunities to expand our business, particularly in areas where we see outsized opportunity. PayPal is an example of this, and is especially important as it will expand our presence in the digital payment space. Another example is our efforts to further penetrate the travel and entertainment sector where appropriate and we continue to make progress in 2017 with the launch of the Cathay Pacific program.","Extending the utility of our cards is another key focus area, particularly expanding the network in which our cards are accepted, so that our cards can move to the top of cardholders\u2019 wallets. This is especially important in our Payment Solutions and CareCredit sales platforms, where we\u2019ve been working to migrate cardholders towards more repeat purchase behavior.","To that end, in Payment Solutions, we launched the Synchrony Car Care network, which offers motorists the convenience of one card to pay for comprehensive auto care at thousands of service and parts locations, as well as fuel at gas stations nationwide. The utility of this card continues to be enhanced with the addition of new partners, such as Mavis Discount Tire being added to the network.","Similarly, we also launched the Synchrony home credit card network accepted by retails at more than 10,000 locations in verticals, such as home furnishing, flooring and electronics. In CareCredit, we recently announced the roll out of our new CareCredit Dual Card. This new card combines the promotional credit capabilities of the standard CareCredit card for purchases within our extensive network with the added convenience of MasterCard acceptance.","The upgrade offers cardholders the ability to earn points for all purchases wherever MasterCard is accepted and offers enhanced rewards for health, fitness, grocery and debt-related purchases. We also further expanded the CareCredit network with our acquisition of the Citi Health Card portfolio in early 2017, and have also expanded into several new verticals, such as durable medical equipment, orthopedics and physical therapy.","The number of provider locations increased by more than 10,000 in 2017. The progress we\u2019ve made in improving the utility, and therefore, the usage of our card is evidenced by our reuse rate. For Payment Solutions, the reuse rate in the fourth quarter was 29% and for CareCredit it was 54% of total purchase volume.","During 2017, we continued our focus in investment on enhancing our leading-edge digital and data analytics capabilities. Early in the year, we acquired GPShopper, an innovative developer of mobile apps that offer a full suite of commerce, engagement and analytics tools and through which we launched our innovative app plug-in, we call SyPi.","We now have 10 partners using the app plug-in and to date we\u2019ve seen a significant growth in usage. We are expanding our mobile engagement capabilities, improving the functionality and ease of use for mobile users and our partners. And this capability enhancing acquisition will help us to do that.","We have invested in a next-generation data environment, which gives us a more holistic view of the customer and enables us to drive higher engagement and a better customer experience using disparate data sources and machine learning techniques. We now have access to approximately 70% of SKU or category level data on the over 1 billion transactions that go over our network compared to less than half of transactions just three years ago.","This is important as we increasingly partner with retailers to leverage this information to grow their program. Additionally, we are using advanced analytic techniques, such as media mix optimization to improve return on marketing investments. Given our significant operational successes and strong growth, we have also had to focus on funding that growth and our deposit base has become an increasingly important part of that equation, especially direct deposit.","We have made investments to enhance the online direct deposit experience for consumers, and this has helped drive direct deposit growth of 13% over the past year. Overall, deposits now comprise 73% of our total funding sources. Through all of this expansion and investment, we\u2019ve been able to maintain a strong balance sheet and deliver value to our shareholders, not only through growth, but via improved capital payout distribution with both an increase in dividends and a substantial increase in share buybacks and the plan we announced last may.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to outline our financial results for the quarter and our expectations for the upcoming year.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Margaret. I\u2019ll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. This morning, we reported fourth quarter earnings of $385 million, or $0.49 per diluted share. But this included the impact related to the remeasurement of our net deferred tax assets, driven by the lower corporate tax rates in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act passed in December.","Excluding this impact, we earned $545 million, or $0.70 per diluted share in the fourth quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth with loan receivables up 7% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 8% over last year. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth we generated across the business.","The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. Purchase volume grew 3% over last year. The slower growth compared to recent quarters was due to the underwriting refinements we have noted previously and the HHGregg bankruptcy. I will cover the impact of the underwriting refinements we\u2019ve made in more detail later in the presentation.","As we move forward and the impact from these items are included in the prior year run rate, we would expect their impact to moderate in future quarters. We had another solid quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 4% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers. The positive trends continued in average balances with growth in average balance per average active account up 4% compared to last year.","RSAs decreased $32 million, or 4%. While we share the strong top line growth and positive operating leverage generated in the quarter, this was offset by higher incremental provision expense. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.9% for the quarter, down from 4.5% last year.","For the year, RSAs were 3.9% versus 4.2% in 2016, reflecting one of the natural offsets in our business model. The provision for loan losses increased 26% over last year, primarily driven by credit normalization. The reserve build in the quarter was $213 million lower than the $275 million range we had expected, driven by moderating credit normalization trends as we enter 2018 and slightly lower receivables growth. I will cover the asset quality metrics in more detail later in the presentation.","Other income was $23 million lower than the prior year. While interchange was up $12 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense and increased by $36 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.","As we noted last quarter, we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near 100% with some quarterly fluctuation. Other expenses increased $52 million, or 6% versus last year, driven primarily by growth in marketing. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program, enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities and investments to automate and streamline our back office.","Lastly, the efficiency ratio was 30.3% for the quarter compared to 31.6% last year over a 130 basis point improvement. The business continues to generate a significant degree of positive operating leverage.","I\u2019ll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 8%, driven by the continued strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.24% compared to last year\u2019s margin of 16.26%. The margin was largely in line with our expectation. The margin benefited from a slightly higher mix receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we\u2019re holding and have deployed excess liquidity to support our strong receivables growth.","This was offset by a slight decline in the yield on receivables down 8 basis points from last year, as well as higher funding costs that increased by 18 basis points, driven by higher rates in our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to higher benchmark rates and prefunding related to PayPal. We will cover our expectations for the margin going forward in our 2018 outlook later.","Next I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, I\u2019ll start with the delinquency trends. 30-plus delinquencies were 4.67% compared to 4.32% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.28% versus 2.03% last year.","Moving to net charge-offs. The net charge-off rate was 5.78% compared to 4.65% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCOs continues to be normalization. This resulted in a 5.37% NCO rate for the year near our expectations.","The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.8% and the reserve build from the third quarter was $213 million. As I noted earlier, the reserve build was lower than the $275 million range we expected due to moderating impact from credit normalization and somewhat slower receivables growth.","As we look forward to 2018, I\u2019d like to describe the impact related to the underwriting refinements on our more recent vintages and our purchase volume growth.","First, the most recent vintages continue to trend in line with our expectations. As you remember, we started making refinements to our underwriting in the second-half of 2016 and we continue to see the positive impact of those changes. Additionally, we have continued to make incremental underwriting changes throughout the year and the vintage curve data suggests that the 2017 vintage is performing better than 2016 and more in line with our 2015 vintage.","Now surprisingly, these underwriting refinements have also resulted in changes to our purchase volume mix by FICO score. If you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification, we continue to grow purchase volume at a fairly strong pace in accounts with a FICO score greater than 721, which increased 10% over the same quarter last year.","While purchase volume for the below 665 FICO range actually declined 13%, reflecting the actions we have been taking. These trends help inform our view of loss expectations in 2018 and beyond. Later, I\u2019ll provide our outlook on credit expectations for next year.","In summary, while credit continues to normalize from here, we expect the pace of the change and the impact on our results will moderate as we move into 2018, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk adjusted returns.","Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $970 million, up 6% over last year. Expenses continued to be primarily driven by growth and marketing. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.3% for the quarter over a 130 basis point improvement over last year, as we continue to drive operating leverage in the core business, while continuing to fund our strategic investments.","For the full-year, the efficiency ratio was 30.3%, down over 80 basis points from the prior year and well below our original outlook back in January of approximately 32%.","Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as continued execution of the capital plan we announced in May. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business.","Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by over $4 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 73% of our funding, slightly higher than the 72% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capabilities. Longer-term, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with our receivables growth.","Overall, we\u2019re pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. As part of our prefunding plan for the PayPal Credit portfolio, we did issue $1 billion of 10-year fixed rate debt in the fourth quarter, which was very well received by the market. We will continue to execute our prefunding plan as we prepare to onboard the PayPal portfolio in the third quarter of 2018. The prefunding will consist of both deposit and wholesale funding. So overall, we continue to execute our funding strategy and feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.","Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 15.8% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 17% on a fully phased-in basis last year around 120 basis point reduction, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our capital plan and growth.","Total liquidity was $21.1 billion, which is equal to 22% of our total assets. This is down from 22.5% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put as well above the required LCR levels.","During the quarter, we continue to execute on the capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and repurchased $430 million of common stock during the fourth quarter. We have a little over $600 million remaining in share repurchases of the $1.64 billion our Board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2018.","We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals. Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Next on Slide 11, I\u2019ll recap our 2017 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables. Our growth of 7% was in line with our outlook range of 7% to 9%. The growth in 2017 continued to be driven by the strong value props on our cards and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth.","Our continued investments in mobile, innovation and data analytics capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth, as well as win new programs. Moderately tempering some of the growth was the impact from the underwriting refinements we began to implement in the second-half of 2016 and continued in 2017.","Net interest margin was 16.35% for the year, which is better than the original range of 15.75% to 16% we provided back in January. Higher receivables yield from higher revolve and benchmark rates, a more optimal asset and funding mix along with some benefit from a lower than expected deposit rate data were the major drivers for the outperformance.","RSAs as a percent of average receivables came in substantially lower than our outlook last January. RSAs came in at 3.9% versus the outlook of 4.4% to 4.5%, mainly driven by the sharing of higher provision expense, partly offset by program performance. This demonstrates the countercyclical nature of the RSAs.","Our net charge-off rate of 5.37% was largely in line with our revised outlook in the low 5% range. Net charge-offs continued to normalize off the very favorable levels in 2015 and 2016 and we expect this to continue into next year, which I will discuss in our outlook.","The efficiency ratio for the year was 30.3%, significantly lower than the outlook of around 32%. We continue to drive strong operating leverage through higher margins, revenue growth and increased productivity, which all led to the outperformance. And lastly, we generated a return on assets of 2.3%, excluding the impact of the Tax Act. The higher margin and operating leverage were offset by higher provision expense. The higher provision expense was partially offset to the RSAs.","Moving to our 2018 outlook on Slide 12. Our macro assumptions for 2018 assume the Fed continues to tighten this year and the unemployment rate is mainly stable. We are providing a view without the impact of onboarding the PayPal Credit portfolio, as well as an outlook including the portfolio.","We expect to close in the third quarter of 2018 and assume a closing date of July 1, 2018 for purposes of the outlook. Our outlook for receivables growth without PayPal is in the 5% to 7% range. The slightly lower growth rate takes into account underwriting refinements and assumes economic trends continue. We expect to grow sales volume at two to three times broader retail sales and for e-commerce to continue with strong growth.","We expect the addition of the PayPal Credit portfolio to drive the growth rate in the 13% to 15% range in the second-half of 2018. We believe our margin before the PayPal portfolio impact would continue to run in the 16.25% range next year. But prefunding the portfolio will have a dilutive effect on the margin, as the funding is held in short-term liquid assets until the portfolio is onboarded.","We believe this may push the margin down closer to 16%, and depending on the timing and magnitude of the prefunding may push the margin into the 15.75% to 16% range for the full-year of 2018. We expect that RSAs as a percent of average receivables will trend back into the 4.2% to 4.4% range for 2018.","This is higher than the 3.9% for 2017 and reflects continued strong performance of our programs, somewhat higher loyalty program expenses and moderating reserve build expectations. The expansion of the PayPal program in the second-half of 2018 will not impact the expected range.","In terms of credit, we expect net charge-offs for 2018 will be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range, driven by continued normalization and slightly lower receivables growth. While the timing of the PayPal portfolio addition given its size will impact the NCO rates in the second-half, we expect to end in a similar range for the full-year.","Looking at seasonality and net charge-offs. We typically see the NCO rate trend higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter, due to the seasonal decline in receivables. While the increase has been in the 50 to 70 basis point range over the past two years, we are expecting a more modest increase as normalization moderates and closer to what we have seen historically.","Regarding loan loss reserves builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds will transition to be more growth-driven, given our expectation that credit normalization trends will continue to moderate. The addition of the PayPal portfolio will add to the reserve builds in the second-half of this year.","We will need to establish a reserve for the portfolio under our reserving methodology and we anticipate a substantial portion of the reserve will be established by year-end 2018. Given the size of the portfolio, this will substantially add to our overall reserve build in the back-half of 2018. This is the main driver of the EPS solution we expect in the second-half of the year after we acquire the portfolio.","For the first quarter, we expect the reserve build to be in the $200 million to $225 million range similar to the fourth quarter and down from the prior run rate, driven by moderating credit normalization trends.","Moving to the efficiency ratio. For 2018, we expect to continue to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of approximately 31% similar to 2017. This would not change with the impact of adding the PayPal portfolio. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business, whoever this will be partly offset by continued spend on strategic investments we feel are important to the business.","Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry and we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward, as we expect the business to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long-term.","Finally, we expect to generate a return on assets of around 2.5% in 2018, including the impact of lower corporate taxes and the estimated dilution from the PayPal transaction. Given the lower corporate tax rates passed in the Tax Act, we expect our effective tax rate will be in the 24% to 25% range going forward. This includes both federal and state taxes.","Before I conclude, I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2018. We are planning to follow a very similar process as before. We will use the Fed scenarios and assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that will review with our Board and our regulators in April, and hope to be in a position to announce our capital plans on a similar timeline as we did last year.","While I cannot be specific as to our capital plans at this point, we would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks, in addition to supporting our growth and program acquisitions.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll close with a recap of our strategic priorities that we continue to focus on to drive value to our partners, cardholders and shareholders. A top priority is to continue to execute across our three sales platforms: building upon our capabilities in marketing, analytics, loyalty and digital and mobile technology. We expect to continue to drive organic growth and we\u2019ll evaluate potential new programs with appropriate risk adjusted returns.","We will make investments necessary to expand the utility of our card and work with our partners to deliver innovative ideas and attractive value propositions to drive card usage. We will continue to invest in next-generation data, analytics and technology offerings and leverage SKU in category level data to help drive an even higher level of engagement with our customers.","Digital and mobile technologies will also remain a top investment priority as the market moves more to these channels, as well as investing in the talent to help develop and drive these capabilities.","Our banking platform remains an important funding source, and as such, we will continue to broaden our products and capabilities. We will also continue to explore new opportunities to leverage our expertise and product offerings in areas where we may not have traditionally had meaningful penetration, such as the travel and entertainment space. It remains paramount that we operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile.","We have proven our ability to do this and it will remain a top priority for us in the future. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operations, business growth, credit rating and regulatory targets.","Finally, we will continue to leverage our strong capital position. Our capital priorities are first and foremost organic growth and program acquisitions. Second, capital return to dividends and share repurchases. And lastly, M&A that helps us enhance our capabilities to support growth.","Synchrony continues to be well-positioned for long-term growth, and we look forward to driving further value for our partners, cardholders and shareholders in 2018.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin our question-and-answer session [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good morning. Brian, maybe first question on the credit quality and the performance in recent vintages. When I look at the charge-off rates for 2018, those seem to be trending a little bit softer than what you guys had initially talked about in terms of a range. Could you just reconcile that with the fact that you\u2019re seeing the \u2013 the later stage vintages, recent vintages trend better?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure, Sanjay. So, look, we generally say that credit is trending exactly in line with our expectations. We gave you an outlook of 5.5% to 5.8% for 2018. Based on all of the trends that we\u2019re seeing, the pace of normalization will flow and will moderate as we move through the year very consistent with our prior view.","The only small tweak that we made was to factor in slightly lower receivables growth. So just due to some of the underwriting refinements that we made, we took down growth just slightly and that does have an impact on the rate. But when we look at the vintages, as we noted earlier, 2017 vintage performing better than 2016, it\u2019s more in line with 2015. We have seen a change in the mix on sales.","We highlighted just in the fourth quarter that sales are down in that below 660 FICO range. But we\u2019re still seeing really good growth in the 720-plus range, sales, they were up 10%. So, again, very much in line with our expectations. The only small tweak was to moderate the growth rate a bit on the core business starting in 2018.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay, great. And then as far as the tax savings are concerned, I\u2019m sorry if I missed this. But are you guys expecting to invest any of the tax savings? And do you expect any kind of competitive response, or activity associated with some of the savings from the industry?","Margaret Keane","Yes. So, Sanjay, it\u2019s Margaret. How are you? I think, the two areas where we\u2019re looking to make an investment is really on our employees and our communities. In terms of investing in the business, we actually have a lot of growth initiatives already built into our plans for those already accounted for. And I don\u2019t know, Brian, if you would add anything else.","Brian Doubles","Yes, I\u2019d say generally, Sanjay, look, we\u2019re very focused on using this benefit in a way that drives real value for our shareholders. I think, that\u2019s our primary objective. We\u2019re able to do some things for employees, a little bit more on charitable contributions. The impact there is pretty modest, it\u2019s included in our outlook.","And then, as Margaret said, we\u2019re always looking at where we can make additional investments in the business. But when we look at that, look, we\u2019re fully funding most of the growth initiatives today that meet our return hurdles. So anything additional there from our perspective right now would be pretty marginal.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Yes. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Thanks very much. Good morning, guys.","Brian Doubles","Good morning, John.","Margaret Keane","Good morning, John.","John Hecht","And a high-level first question is, maybe can you give us just any update on incremental trends in the competitive market? And then any updates on any progress for upcoming notable renewals?","Margaret Keane","Sure. So, I think that competitive environment has been pretty much the same. We expect 2018 to be the same as 2017. I think, probably for us what we\u2019re very focused on is our renewals. I can\u2019t comment on any particular one. But what I would tell you is that, our teams are well entrenched in our partners and working every single day to work on those renewals and working hard to really focus on what our partners need.","So, we feel pretty good about the pipeline. We felt pretty good about the competitive environment, and we\u2019re investing to make sure we\u2019re meeting our partners\u2019 needs, and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on.","John Hecht","Okay, thanks for that. And then, Margaret, do you have any of the digital stats that \u2013 you\u2019ve given these historically the e-commerce composition and the growth in that segment?","Margaret Keane","Sure. Sure, so I would say that online sales were up 15% year-over-year and that growth is in line with where the industry is now, which is about 15%. I would say, one of the real positive is, we continue to see some really good sales penetration in our retail card business, which was up 26%, 1.5% over the prior quarter. So we continue to stay very focused on this and driving volume through the mobile and digital channels.","John Hecht","Great. Thanks very much, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks. Brian, I was kind of intrigued by the disparity between the growth at the higher-end of the FICO band and the lower-end. Just maybe could you talk a little bit of how long that persists? I mean, is that several quarters, or is it longer than that? And when can that that effect of the lower FICO band kind of \u2013 will that go away?","Brian Doubles","Yes, Moshe, look, it\u2019s a good question. I think, we would clearly expect that to moderate as we head into 2018. What you\u2019re seeing really and you saw a little bit of it in the third quarter and the fourth quarter is really the cumulative impact of those underwriting refinements that we made starting in the second-half of 2016. So you\u2019re starting to see that come to the books.","So when you look at \u2013 and I should just comment that, we\u2019re still booking plenty of sales between 600 and 660 FICO. That\u2019s still a great segment for us. We\u2019re still booking profitable volume at attractive returns there. It\u2019s just when you compare it to what we were doing a year ago, it\u2019s down.","Moshe Orenbuch","Right.","Brian Doubles","Slightly. So I would think about it continuing for a couple of more quarters, hard to predict exactly. We\u2019re constantly going in and making these refinements based on where we\u2019re seeing the returns and where we\u2019re seeing the profitability.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Just as a follow-up question. The PayPal\u2019s dilutive to your returns in 2018, could you talk a little bit about what that would mean, as it goes forward past that both from the standpoint of what you might see in terms of its impact on the company\u2019s growth and returns?","Brian Doubles","Look, it\u2019s obviously a great growth opportunity for us. We cannot be more excited about the program and the expanded partnership with PayPal. I think, in terms of how to think about it going forward, we\u2019ve been very clear on 2018 what the impact is at PayPal.","As you move into 2019, it\u2019s definitely accretive from an EPS standpoint. Longer-term, the return is in line with the overall return of the business. So we really like the program. We really like the returns. It\u2019s got a very resilient earnings profile through multiple scenarios, which is something obviously that we look for when launching a new program or expanding a partnership. So we\u2019re\u2026","Moshe Orenbuch","Great.","Brian Doubles","Like I said, we couldn\u2019t be more excited about it.","Moshe Orenbuch","Thanks very much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. Brian, we saw the year-over-year change in your delinquency rate slow last November for the first time in 2017, and then held there again in December, we saw this morning. Is it reasonable to expect that that downward trajectory that we\u2019re now seeing is going to continuous we look ahead. And ultimately, does that translate into less reserve building in 2018 versus 2017 and also less reserve building in 2019 versus 2018 x PayPal and assuming that their current environment \u2013 macro that \u2013 environment that we\u2019re in persist?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure, Bill. Look, great question. I think, as you pointed out, the delinquency trends did begin to moderate this quarter. So, last quarter \u2013 or I guess, third quarter year-over-year, they were up 54 basis points. We saw that come down to 35 basis point increase in the fourth quarter year-over-year. So that was in line with our expectations. It\u2019s obviously driven by some of the tightening that we\u2019ve done.","We would expect that trend to continue. That\u2019s part of what you saw in the reserve build coming in better than our expectations here in the fourth quarter. We\u2019ve given you a view of what we think reserves look like in the first quarter. Clearly, for the year, we expect the reserve builds to moderate and return to being more growth-driven than they were certainly in 2017. So again, the outlook, very consistent both on credit and reserve builds to where we thought it would be earlier in the year.","Bill Carcache","So perhaps just to extend that thought process a little bit, I guess, by definition, moving to a more growth-driven from previously having not only being growth-driven, but also normalization and seasoning-driven, that effectively would mean a lower reserve build in 2018 versus 2017, is that thought process reasonable?","Brian Doubles","Yes, that\u2019s reasonable. I mean, if you just go back to 2017, our reserve builds for the first three quarters were in that $300 million to $350 million range per quarter. That\u2019s come down now to the $213 million in the fourth quarter. We\u2019re giving an outlook for the first quarter of $200 million to $225 million, so similar to the fourth quarter.","And if you just kind of run that out, again, excluding PayPal, right, the core reserve builds, the expectation would be, they would moderate and be lower in 2018 compared to 2017. Then obviously, the addition of PayPal will significantly add to the reserve builds in the second-half. So the best way to think about PayPal is, we\u2019re bringing on the portfolio most likely in the third quarter and we\u2019re starting with a reserve of zero.","So effectively, over, call it, roughly nine months, maybe 12 months, we\u2019re going to build a full reserve under our existing methodology. So think about 14 to 15 months for a loss coverage on that and we\u2019re going to build it over nine to 12 months. So a lot of that is going to come in, in the second-half of the year, and that\u2019s really the driver of the $0.20 of dilution that we indicated back in November on PayPal really driven by that allowance build.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s great. Brian, thank you. If I may quickly on my follow-up on NIM. I wanted to ask, perhaps just if you could clarify the NIM compression. Isn\u2019t that more optical than anything else in the sense that it\u2019s driven by the liquidity build associated with kind of prefunding? And so, there really is no kind of negative or adverse NII impact from the liquidity that you\u2019re bringing?","Brian Doubles","That\u2019s a good way to think about it. So, the core net interest margin is very stable around that 16.25% range, very consistent with the 2017 rate. So core NIM is stable. And then as you start to include the impact of prefunding PayPal, that does bring the margin down a bit that funding that we\u2019re going to bring on here in the first-half, we hold out in short-term assets until the portfolio is brought on the book.","So you\u2019ve got a combination of some negative carry on that funding. You\u2019ve also got the impact from the larger denominator on the NIM rate. So you\u2019ll probably see the largest impact in the second quarter before you bring the portfolio on. So I would think about NIM adjusted for PayPal closer to 16%, it could dip a little below that depending on the timing and the magnitude of the prefunding. That\u2019s why we gave you a little bit of a conservative range 15.75% to 16%. It was really driven by the timing and the magnitude of that funding is a little bit unknown at this point.","Bill Carcache","Thank you.","Brian Doubles","But again, I think, importantly, core net interest margin, very stable.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning, guys.","Margaret Keane","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Brian, maybe if I can ask about the RSA, so came in at 3.88% well below the original guidance, and now we\u2019re talking about getting back to kind of 4.3% in the middle \u2013 midpoint of the range. I guess, given that, it seems like a lot is also shifting to the loyalty line at this point. Can you just maybe talk about the interplay of the two and how we get back from this 3.88% to something in the 4.2% to 4.4% range? And can you just maybe talk about are the RSAs impacted at all by tax reform, or all the programs based on pre-tax profitability?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure, Ryan. There\u2019s a lot in there, so bring me back if I miss something. I think, in terms of the RSA, the best way to think about it is to go back to our original outlook for 2017, which was 4.4% to 4.5%, okay, 4.4% to 4.5% for the year. That that\u2019s what I would consider more of a historical norm on the RSAs.","Now, as you pointed out, we ended the year at 3.9%, right? And that was due primarily to the retailers sharing in that incremental provision expense that we had, as well as additional loyalty program expense, okay? So those two items more than offset the increase in sharing from higher margins and we also had better operating leverage year-over-year.","So, look, I think, that\u2019s obviously a good thing. That highlights one of the natural offsets to credit normalization for our business. So now as you start to think about 2018, we expect the RSAs to be in that 4.2% to 4.4% range. That reflects both the combination of strong program performance. We also expect the reserve build, as I mentioned earlier, to moderate as we move through the year.","So just the construct of lower reserve builds, obviously, our partners will benefit from that. That increases the RSA payments and it puts us closer to that historical range. It doesn\u2019t put us all the way back, but we think somewhere in the 4.2% to 4.4% range.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Now if I could just ask a follow-up. Just in terms of the credit guidance, the 5.5% to 5.8%, given that, consumers are obviously going to get a benefit from tax reform. Can you talk about is there anything baked into your guidance in terms of improving credit from customers having more money in their pocket?","And I guess, just related to that, given the lower core growth that you\u2019re going to be experiencing in the 5% to 7% relative to last year, I think, last quarter you had said something around $170 million or so for reserving for growth. Is that still the right number? Is it lower now, given the fact that growth is a little bit slower? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure, Ryan. So there\u2019s nothing in the outlook for a better economy or consumers benefiting from personal tax reform. Obviously, lower personal tax rate should provide more discretionary income to the consumer. We would expect to benefit somewhat either through increased sales or on the credit side. But like it\u2019s really too early to speculate on either of those, we haven\u2019t baked anything into the forecast. So I think, look, there\u2019s some reason potentially to be optimistic there. We didn\u2019t include anything. So I think, it\u2019s still a little bit early to tell.","And then your other question was on?","Ryan Nash","The absolute level of growth reserve build, given slower growth?","Brian Doubles","Yes, look, I think that drove a little bit of the build in the fourth quarter being a little bit better than our expectations. Going forward, that\u2019s included in our outlook that reserve build will moderate and come down slightly. But the best way to think about the reserve builds in 2018 compared to 2017 is credit normalization leveling off.","We will continue to book reserves for growth. We\u2019re not going to give you a split. It\u2019s a little bit difficult to estimate out beyond really the first quarter. But I think the important thing is that, we\u2019ve included an outlook that as credit normalization is going to level off, you\u2019ll see that in the reserve build. The reserve build will become more growth-driven and that\u2019s all in line with our earlier outlook.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. My question mainly has to do with how conservative you feel this new charge-off guidance is. I mean, you guys I think have been I know that every other guidance item have been overly conservative. But on this one, you\u2019ve had to make \u2013 in charge-offs, you\u2019ve had to make revisions in the past. Just interested to get your perspective on when you set this new guidance for 2018, where you kind of mindful of setting at a level where you\u2019re pretty confident, you\u2019re going to be within that, if not below that range?","Brian Doubles","Yes, look, Mark, I \u2013 we tend to give you \u2013 we try to give you our best view of what we think 2018 is going to look like. Some things typically perform a little bit better. Some things come in a little bit worse. And we think, if you go back to 2017, we showed you how we performed against all the key metrics. And you also have natural offsets in the business, I think, you need to take into account.","So if you just kind of walk through the 2017 performance, we saw more credit normalization than we thought we would back in January of last year, and the offset to that is lower RSAs and better margins and you get back to a very strong return. And so I think, I \u2013 with the exception of maybe margins, where given the timing of the prefunding that can drive a difference in the rate, I wouldn\u2019t call the guidance conservative. I think, the outlook is our best view. And look, we\u2019re obviously all focused on trying to beat those metrics where we can.","Mark DeVries","Okay, fair enough. And then just on the prefunding, is there anything you can do or considering to push that out a bit. So that you\u2019re not carrying too much cash on balance sheet well in advance of getting those receivables?","Brian Doubles","Yes, look, I would say, we are acutely aware of how expensive that prefunding is, and we are going to try and manage it as best we can. This is a very large asset that we\u2019re going to bring on here in the third quarter. We\u2019re going to be in regular dialogue with PayPal on timing. And when we expect to close and we\u2019re not going to bring a $1 of funding on that we don\u2019t have to.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions this morning. There\u2019s an interesting relationship that\u2019s developing between spend growth and loan growth and the gap has widened. Brian, you or Margaret you\u2019ve actually given some very good metrics on the differentiation between the 660 spend above and below. I\u2019m a little bit surprised to see the gap loan growth widen to spend as you have less concentration from the 660 borrowers, line limits for the higher FICO borrowers?","Brian Doubles","Yes. So, yes, I mean the best way to think about this is that, when you\u2019re making underwriting refinements and tightening a bit like we have been, you\u2019re going to see that materialize first in your sales, right? So that\u2019s where you\u2019re starting to see that you saw in the third quarter, you see in the fourth quarter. And then the other underlying dynamic credit normalization is, you tend to pick up more revolve on the overall portfolio, right, where back-end 2014, 2015 and 2016, we saw kind of an acceleration in deleveraging that\u2019s come back a bit.","And so you see more revolve on the overall portfolio, which is offsetting that decline in purchase volume. Obviously over time, after \u2013 again, the cumulative impacts of some of these \u2013 some of the tightening that we\u2019ve done, you\u2019re going to see that result in somewhat lower receivables growth, which is really what you\u2019re seeing in our outlook in that 5% to 7% range. So at some point that purchase volume will materialize and those two line up more closely. Does that make sense?","Rick Shane","Yes, it does. And obviously, the retail partners really value the liquidity that you provide to their costumers. Are you getting any pushback if you tweak the underwriting and make less credit available to those sub-660 borrowers?","Margaret Keane","I think, our partners are very cognizant of the fact that they don\u2019t want to put credit in hands of people that can handle it. And we work very closely with them in many cases, almost all cases, their names are on the cards. So we work very closely with them and we are not getting any pushback on credit. They work closely with us and again, we all want to be responsible here, including our partners.","Brian Doubles","And again, this is \u2013 these are modest refinements. These aren\u2019t wholesale changes to our underwriting strategy. You\u2019re seeing a bit of the cumulative effect on sales, but we\u2019re not changing the overall risk profile of the portfolio.","Rick Shane","Got it. Great. Thank you, guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Just a question on the net charge-off rate with the 5.50% to 5.80% guidance for next year with and without PayPal. I\u2019m just wondering, if there\u2019s a \u2013 without PayPal, are you thinking that it\u2019s more in the lower-end of the range and with it\u2019s towards the higher-end of the range. I\u2019m just wondering, because PayPal\u2019s credit quality, at least, as they\u2019ve been underwriting it, is a bit riskier than what you\u2019ve been underwriting. So I\u2019m kind of struck by the fact that you\u2019ve got the same numbers for both scenarios?","Brian Doubles","Yes, Betsy. So, look, I think, PayPal might move us around within the range. We don\u2019t think it changes the range for the full-year. I think, it\u2019s a good question. Just given the PayPal portfolio does run at a higher loss rate than our portfolio in the aggregate. As you start to think about 2019 and beyond, we do expect there would be some upward bias on the rate as we move through 2019 and beyond that. But it\u2019s a little hard to be specific that far out.","Betsy Graseck","And do you anticipate running the portfolio from a credit perspective the same way they\u2019ve run it, or do you expect to run that piece of the portfolio in line with how you\u2019ve been running the rest of your book?","Brian Doubles","Yes. So, well, first, I would just say, we\u2019re very comfortable with the risk profile of the PayPal portfolio. At this point, we don\u2019t anticipate any significant changes in the way that it\u2019s being underwritten today. We\u2019re obviously going to leverage our underwriting analytics and our process. But we\u2019re also going to utilize PayPal scores and some of their techniques. They\u2019ve got a lot of really great transactional data that we can leverage.","So when you combine what they\u2019re doing today with some of our proprietary underwriting techniques and some of our models, I think, we can get even more sophisticated around how we manage the portfolio together. So\u2026","Betsy Graseck","Is that something that\u2019s walled\u2026?","Brian Doubles","No, go ahead.","Betsy Graseck","Is that walled off to PayPal like can you utilize what you learn from that and with others or that\u2019s walled off to that relationship?","Brian Doubles","Yes. No, we \u2013 it\u2019s very customized by program. So we don\u2019t air across programs, it\u2019s very proprietary and customized for the individual programs. So what I would say on PayPal, look, we ultimately control underwriting, but we\u2019re going to leverage the data, the tools, the expertise of both companies to make the best underwriting decisions we can.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Greg Ketron","So we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question will come from Ashish Sabadra with Deutsche Bank.","Ashish Sabadra","Thanks. Just maybe a quick clarification, the efficiency ratio of 31% that you\u2019ve guided to, that does include any kind of reinvestments from the tax benefit that you\u2019re going to get, is that right?","Brian Doubles","That\u2019s correct.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay. Was there any kind of a noise from the hurricanes in the quarter? And if there was, can you help quantify that? And just maybe the second part to that would be, any comments on the recovery trends? How those been trending? And how do you think about recovery going forward?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So, on the hurricanes back in October, I think, we disclosed that hurricane impact would put us towards the higher-end of the net charge-off rate. Yes, I wouldn\u2019t highlight really anything other than that. And then on recoveries, nothing really in the quarter, recovery pricing was pretty stable.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay. And maybe if I \u2013 on the hurricanes if I can just ask a follow-up like, as you go forward, what are your expectations, because that hurricane effect should really come off. So should we see better like underlying trends continue, but that hurricane negative impact come off?","Brian Doubles","Yes, I wouldn\u2019t think about it is being material going forward.","Ashish Sabadra","Okay, thanks. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Sure.","Greg Ketron","Okay. Thanks, everyone, for joining us on a conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. So we hope you have a great day.","Operator","Thank you.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks Greg. Good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today. I'll begin on slide three. Overall, we had a good quarter with earnings of $696 million or $0.92 per share. Loan receivables grew 5% within our expected range and we generated solid net interest income growth of 3%. Brian will provide full details on our quarterly results later in the call.","Today I'd like to spend my time addressing the topics that are obviously of greatest interest this morning; the closing of the PayPal transaction and that we will not be renewing the Walmart program agreement. First, I'll start with PayPal. We are very excited about expanding the PayPal partnership which occurred July 02. PayPal's two U.S. credit offerings are now consolidated into one relationship providing significant opportunity for us, PayPal, and PayPal customers.","In addition to recently extending our cobranded consumer card program with PayPal for 10 years we are now the exclusive issuer of the PayPal credit online consumer financing program in the U.S. As part of the transaction we have acquired PayPal's U.S. consumer credit receivables portfolio as well as interest held by other investors totaling $7.6 billion. Moving forward with PayPal to become the exclusive issuer PayPal credit in the U.S. is a natural extension of our successful 14-year relationship.","This collaboration built on a key relationship in the rapidly growing digital payment space expands our capabilities within the merchant environment and leverages both companies' strengths in providing seamless digital payments and innovations for merchants and consumers. Together we can provide an enhanced customer experience for thousands of merchants and consumers combining our program management, credit capabilities and balance sheet with PayPal's platform and trusted brand as a leader in digital and mobile payments should help create superior products and offerings for consumers and merchants.","The two programs require a unique organizational focus given that they address different customer needs; rewards for co-brand and financing for PayPal credit, two areas in which we have expertise, also having one partner to holistically manage both programs for PayPal allows for synergies and could provide opportunities for migrating customers between products as their needs change. This expanded relationship supports our continued reach in the rapidly growing digital payments channel.","We have built a strong reputation in this space and this program will allow us to meet evolving consumer needs. We primarily compete on our capabilities including our significant experience, scale, dedicated teams, data analytics, loyalty programs, digital capabilities and proven record of providing value-added services to our partners. These capabilities all played an important role in expanding our relationship with PayPal.","We are obviously extremely happy to have expanded the significant relationship as we leverage the new opportunities to meaningfully expand the program. Brian will detail the financial impact this transaction will have on our outlook for the year later in the call.","We also announced that we will not be renewing our program agreement with Walmart which is set to end in the third quarter of 2019. It is important to note at the outset that one of the two potential scenarios will likely play out as a result of not renewing the program; either we sell the existing portfolio to a new issuer or the portfolio will stay with us and we convert the qualifying portion of the portfolio to a general-purpose card. In either scenario we believe we can replace the EPS impact resulting from the nonrenewal and we expect both options will be accretive to EPS relative to renewing the program. Brian will cover the financial implications of not renewing the program later.","With regard to not renewing the program, let me begin by saying that we are proud of the value we created for Walmart and our cardholders over the 18 years we managed the credit program for Walmart which began as a startup program. The product development, marketing, and servicing skills, value propositions, and technology, and digital expertise that we brought to the program all played a critical role in the growth and success of the program.","Last year we began discussions with Walmart about renewing our relationship. Although we competed aggressively to renew the program, we were unable to reach terms that would have made economic sense for our company and our shareholders. Instead we will focus on opportunities in other areas of our business where we see significant potential for growth at more attractive risk adjusted returns over time. This is consistent with our disciplined approach to managing our business for the long-term.","Our capabilities are best in class and we believe that our continued investments in digital and data analytics coupled with our long-standing expertise in managing these programs and scale makes us one of the best credit program providers in the U.S. In this case other elements were in play that would have resulted in an economic profile that was sub optimal for the capital supporting the program.","Our strategy across all platforms is based on building long-term relationships with our partners and cardholders by offering superior capabilities, service, and value propositions while generating attractive risk adjusted returns. As I have noted many times, we think about our growth opportunities against the broader backdrop of a payment industry that has been going through a period of significant change.","New technologies are driving the consumer behavior and the convergence of in-store and digital commerce is opening up new opportunities that play to the strength of our business. These trends present us with a number of growth opportunities with the expansion of the PayPal strategic credit relationship being a great example of these opportunities.","We continue to feel good about the capabilities, products, marketing, servicing, and digital expertise and value propositions we bring to our partners, their programs and cardholders and the economics of these relationships and the ability to grow these programs. We attempted to reach a similar outcome with Walmart, but unfortunately we were not able to agree on terms that made economic sense for us and our shareholders.","Instead we will invest in opportunities that we think can generate greater returns over time and help us drive innovation in this space. Walmart has clearly been a sizable relationship for us. Not renewing our agreement at the terms required is the right long term outcome and it does present some options as we move forward.","I'm now going to turn the call over to Brian, who will walk you through the highlights on the quarter, provide details on the PayPal transaction impact to our outlook and discuss our options related to the Walmart portfolio, and the potential financial impacts.","Brian Doubles","Thanks Margaret. I'll start on slide six of the presentation. I'm going to briefly touch on the highlights of the quarter so that I can spend more time on the PayPal and Walmart nonrenewal impacts. This morning we reported second quarter earnings of $696 million which translates to $0.92 per diluted share. We continue to deliver good growth with loan receivables up 5% in interest and fees on loan receivables up 4% over last year.","The slower growth in recent quarters reflects the underwriting refinements we have noted previously. As we move forward and the impact from these items are included in the prior year run rate we would expect their impact to moderate in future quarters. RSAs decreased 16 million or 2% from last year primarily due to the Toys \"R\" Us bankruptcy. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 3.4% for the quarter compared to 3.6% last year.","The provision for loan losses decreased $46 million or 3% from last year driven by the lower reserve build. The reserve build in the quarter was $121 million lower than the $175 million range we had expected and substantially lower than the $325 million reserve build in the second quarter of last year. Both reflect the moderating trends in credit normalizations and slightly lower loan receivables growth due to the impact from our underwriting refinements.","Other expenses increased $64 million or 7% versus last year driven primarily by growth in strategic investments as well as expenses related to on-boarding the PayPal credit program. The efficiency ratio was 31% for the quarter compared to 30.1% last year and in line with our expectations. The slight increase was driven by growth, the timing of strategic investments, as well as the upfront build costs related to on-boarding PayPal credit.","Lastly we did continue our pre-funding in the second quarter ahead of the closing of the PayPal credit portfolio on July 02. As expected this impacted metrics in the second quarter such as the net interest margin which I will cover next on slide seven.","Net interest income was up 3% driven primarily by loan receivables growth and net interest margin was 15.33% compared to last year's margin of 16.2%. The margin was largely in line with our expectations. As expected the largest impact on margin performance was the impact of pre-funding the PayPal portfolio acquisition.","Next I'll cover our key credit trends on slide eight. In terms of specific dynamics in the quarter, the key highlights are the improving trends and delinquencies and the lower-than-expected reserve build of $121 million. 30+ delinquencies were 4.17% compared to 4.25% last year. The year-over-year trends in the 30+ delinquency rates continue to improve for the third quarter in a row with the 30+ delinquency rate now slightly below the prior year, reflecting a more modest impact from normalization and the impact of our underwriting refinements.","The net charge-off rate was 5.97% compared to 5.42% last year and in line with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 7.43% and the reserve build from the first quarter was $121 million. As I noted earlier, the reserve build was lower than the $175 million range we expected due to the improving credit trends and somewhat slower receivables growth as well as the impact from our underwriting refinements.","The most recent vintages continue to trend in line with our expectations. We started to make refinements to our underwriting in the second half of 2016 and we continue to see the positive impact of those changes. The vintage curve data suggests that the 2017 vintage is performing better than 2016 and more in line with our 2015 vintage. Not surprisingly these underwriting refinements continued to impact our purchase volume mix by FICO score.","If you look at purchase volume by FICO's stratification we continue to grow at a fairly strong pace and accounts with a FICO score greater than 721 which increased 8% over the same quarter last year. Our purchase volume for the below 660 FICO score range actually declined 13% reflecting the actions we've been taking. These trends help inform our view of loss expectations in 2018 and beyond.","Moving to slide nine, I'll briefly cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $975 million up 7% over last year. Expenses continue to be primarily driven by growth and strategic investments as well as preparing for the expansion of the PayPal credit program.","Moving to slide 10 we ended the quarter at 16.6% CET 1 under the fully phased in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.2% on a fully phased in basis last year a 60 basis point reduction reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our capital plan and growth. During the quarter we completed the capital plan we announced in May of last year. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and repurchased 210 million of common stock fulfilling the 1.64 billion and share repurchase our board authorized through June 30.","On May 17, we were pleased to announce our new capital plans through June 30, 2019. Our board approved an increase in the quarterly common stock dividend to $0.21 per share commencing in the third quarter and a share repurchase program of up to 2.2 billion. We began to execute our new plan in May repurchasing 281 million during the quarter in addition to the 210 to complete the prior program for a total of 491 million of repurchases in the second quarter.","Now that we have on-boarded the PayPal credit portfolio, I wanted to recap our current view for the year which is on slide 11. As you will know, our current view for 2018 including the PayPal portfolio is fairly consistent with the outlook we provided back in January. Starting with receivables growth taking into account the addition of the nearly $8 billion PayPal portfolio, we still expect our year-over-year growth rate to be in the 13% to 15% range.","Regarding our margin outlook for the full year 2018 it is unchanged at 15.75% to 16% including the impact of the PayPal portfolio acquisition. For the next two quarters we expect the margin to be in the 16% range as the liquidity from the pre-funding is deployed to fund the portfolio restoring the margin back to around 16% for the remainder of the year.","We expect RSAs to run closer to 4% of average receivables for the year, down from the 4.2% to 4.4% range in the previous outlook. RSAs have been trending lower reflecting the slower growth in recent quarters a modest reduction in yield given improving delinquency trends and the impact of the Toys\"R\"Us bankruptcy.","We continue to expect NCOs to be in the 5.5% to 5.8% range for the full year of 2018 including the impact of the PayPal portfolio. We expect credit normalization to continue to moderate. It is also important to remember that seasonality typically results in a lower net charge-off rate in the third quarter.","Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward we thought it would be helpful to break out core reserve build and PayPal reserve build dynamics we expect next quarter. Regarding the reserve build on our existing or core portfolio, we expect the builds to continue to transition to be more growth driven as we move through the rest of 2018 and will be similar to this quarter in the $125 million to $150 million range in the third quarter.","The on-boarding of the PayPal credit portfolio will result in much higher reserve build in the second half of this year due to the accounting requirements around portfolio acquisitions. We expect the reserve build related to the PayPal portfolio to be in the $300 to $325 million range in the third quarter for a total reserve build of $425 million to $475 million next quarter.","Turning to expenses, we continue to generate positive operating leverage and continue to expect the efficiency ratio to be around 31% for the full year. We also continue to expect our return on assets will be around 2.5% for 2018.","In summary, the business continues to generate good growth with attractive long-term returns. Assuming economic conditions and the health of the consumer are consistent going forward, our expectation is that core reserve builds will continue to moderate through this year which combined with continued growth of the business and the impact from the continuing capital actions will help us continue to generate EPS growth in 2018.","Moving to slide 12, I will walk you through the strategic options for the Walmart portfolio and the potential impacts. Not renewing the program will result in two options regarding the future of the portfolio which we have portrayed on slide 12. In both cases we believe that we can replace the EPS impact of not renewing the program and we expect that both options will be accretive to EPS relative to renewing the program.","The two options are we sell the portfolio to the new issuer or we retain the portfolio and convert it to a Synchrony branded MasterCard beginning in the first quarter of 2019. The direction and timing will likely unfold over the next several months. This is a process that is contractually defined and we expect to have clarity on the direction we'll be headed with the portfolio by the end of the first quarter next year.","I will start with the scenario were the portfolio was sold to the new issuer. There is a valuation process that will take place and once evaluation process is complete Walmart or the new issuer will have the option to purchase the portfolio at the price determined by the valuation process. If the portfolio was purchased it would transfer to the new issuer in the third quarter of 2019. For us this will free up capital. The way to think about that is using a CET 1 level near 15% as a proxy post the addition of the PayPal portfolio.","Given the size of the Walmart portfolio of approximately $10 billion this would be around $1.5 billion of capital freed up. There is also the potential gain on the portfolio as well as releasing the reserve held against the portfolio. While we don't know the specifics at this point, we estimate approximately $2.5 billion could potentially be available to buy back shares or utilize on higher returning alternatives.","We would expect to deploy this capital quickly starting as soon as the determination is made whether the portfolio is being sold or retained. We have also identified $300 million to $350 million of expected ongoing expense savings after the portfolio was sold. We believe there would be enough capital available to be deployed to our share buybacks and other alternatives and that combined with expense savings will be enough to offset the EPS impact of not renewing the program and be accretive to EPS had we renewed the program.","The sale of the portfolio will not impact the return profile of the company and would also improve certain operating metrics such as credit quality. As an example, the net charge-off ratio alone would improve by approximately 60 to 70 basis points.","Moving to the second scenario, once we have clarity on whether we retain the portfolio, we would begin converting the qualifying portion of the portfolio to a general-purpose card. This builds on the successful strategy we used for the formal Toys \"R\" Us portfolio after they filed bankruptcy. There are several benefits in doing this. First, we retain all the economics generated from the program as we no longer share the portfolio returned to an RSA.","Second we gain a significant level of diversification in our overall portfolio as we will have a higher mix of general-purpose cards without a contractually defined term tied to a program renewal and we gain flexibility through the potential of increasing our offerings to existing and prospective cardholders in conjunction with strategies such as building out a full-scale deposit platform.","And we also have the potential to significantly improve the credit quality of the portfolio at acceptable risk-adjusted returns over time that would enhance the overall return profile of the portfolio. Under this scenario we would begin the conversion of qualifying accounts as early as the first quarter of 2019. For accounts that are not initially converted to a general-purpose card, those cardholders can continue to use their cards at Walmart over the next three years and we will receive royalties from Walmart for card usage over this period.","Regarding the brand marketing of the general-purpose card as well as loyalty costs associated with our offering a very attractive value prop on the card, these costs will be more than funded by the economics we now retain that previously were being shared with Walmart as well as the interchange fees we earn on card usage.","We will also have an opportunity to optimize the cost structure supporting the portfolio. Overall we believe either scenario, whether we sell the portfolio or retain it will replace the earnings per share being generated by the program and will be accretive relative to what we could have earned from the program if we had renewed it.","And with that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks Brian. I'll provide a quick wrap up and then we'll open the call for Q&A. We continue to generate solid results as well as driving growth organically, expanding important programs such as PayPal by launching and renewing key programs and making strategic investments to improve our position in this ever evolving marketplace.","We are also seeing other important elements of our business, such as credit quality continue to perform as we had expected. All of this contributes to our ability to return capital to shareholders and we were pleased to announce the significant increases in our dividend and share repurchase program in May. We also focused on deploying capital through organic growth and program acquisitions such as the PayPal program as well as the capability enhancing investments such as e-commerce.","And while we are disappointed that we are not renewing our program with Walmart, we are focused on either optimizing the capital freed up if the portfolio was sold or leveraging the benefits from retaining the portfolio. Both provide us the ability to replace and potentially improve EPS and other operating metrics that would have otherwise resulted from renewing the program. We remain focused on risk adjusted returns pursuing strategies that help us to profitably grow the business and deliver value for our partners, cardholders, and shareholders.","I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow up question. If you have additional questions the Investor Relations team will be available after the call. Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Good morning guys and thanks very much for all the details around Walmart and PayPal and thanks for taking my questions. The first on Walmart, you guys specifically carved out the change in the loss patterns and expense savings, just wondering is there any - would there be any change to the RSA metric in the absence of Walmart?","Brian Doubles","So, why don't I walk you through just a little more detail in terms of what to expect on the key metrics, so obviously in terms of the profitability of the business it doesn't really change the return profile of the company as we noted. The biggest impact you see if the portfolio is sold is that improvement in net charge-offs, so you'd see that 60 to 70 basis point improvement there.","And then you'd see partial offsets on yield. It would come down just slightly. And then RSAs would move a little higher excluding the Walmart portfolio. And then all in you get back to a similar return for the overall business. So again, I think the biggest change you are going to see is the improvement in the credit metrics and it will be neutral to the return.","John Hecht","Okay, thanks Brian. And then I know you guys haven't given any guidance pertaining to 2019, but you will be I think lapping a lot of the tightening next year, but we're also going to have the PayPal portfolio in there. Brian, what's your perception of kind of normalized growth in the portfolio once tightening has been fully imbedded in the system? And then have you guys - can you guys give an update on the way you see the PayPal portfolio growth rate separately?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure John. Obviously we don't give 2019 growth guidance but in terms of the impact the credit actions are taking we've been pretty clear that we'll start to lap those starting probably first or second quarter of 2019 and we would expect to move back more historical norm in terms of the core growth rate for the business, so no change to that view.","PayPal is obviously growing at a much faster rate. We see a lot of incremental growth opportunity of PayPal even above and beyond, what we've been - what the program has been growing historically, so ton of opportunity there. So we feel pretty good. As you think about a combination of a strong core growth rate once we start to lap these credit actions combined with bringing on a really high growth program like PayPal, we feel pretty good about 2019, but other than that we're not going to be real specific at this point. We'll give you some more color in January when we do our outlook.","John Hecht","Great, thanks very much for the color.","Brian Doubles","Sure","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, I was sort of hoping you could expand a little bit on the comment that you made about the kind of results had you retained the program being kind of forgetting the exact words that you used, but maybe just expand on what that would have meant in terms of the ability to earn to generate the returns on your capital and maybe relate that to the discussions that have been out there about some of Walmart\u2019s desire for expansion of Walmart Pay and does that result in some shift in the way your business you know kind of continues as we go forward?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure Moshe. Why don\u2019t I start on the more financial question and then Margaret can talk on the latter one. Look, this program was somewhat unique in terms of the profile. That became a challenge for us from an economic standpoint. And in this case we just weren't able to earn a return that was in line with the credit risk of the portfolio. Under the old agreement we were earning an acceptable return for that risk. In the renewal discussions it became clear that we weren't going to be able to maintain that acceptable return level for the risk that we were taking.","So look as we went through the process it became clear that either option that we've portrayed on that slide was accretive to what a renewal would have earned for us. And that combined with the risk sharing in the program, the credit risk profile of the portfolio, this became very challenging for us. And I'll just, Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Yes, so I wouldn't say you know Moshe we\u2019re already in Walmart Pay and I think it\u2019s important to note and this is critical as we have another whole year with the program, so we're going to have to continue to support Walmart in every way we can and will continue to leverage Walmart Pay since our cards are in it. So we did, no go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","It's just a follow up, I mean PayPal also is available as a payment method on \u2013 at Walmart.com right?","Margaret Keane","That's correct, so if the customer has one of our cards or the program with us it will be used wherever PayPal is accepting. So I don't believe and I think you're kind of leading to this thought of capabilities and our capabilities maybe versus Capital One. But we strongly believe that our capabilities are best in class and our continued investments in digital and data are really paying off for us and we're seeing this more and more with our partners as they're placing a much higher value on our capabilities particularly us this transformation is having to you know going to digital.","So from our perspective, we felt like we could have delivered what Walmart wanted in terms of the digital transformation. As a matter of fact we put together a pretty incredible program that we thought we could continue to drive with them, but obviously as Brian said we couldn't get there on the economics.","Moshe Orenbuch","Got it. Okay, thanks I'll get back in the queue.","Margaret Keane","Thank you, Moshe.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks, good morning. Just to follow up on those questions, obviously you have a large secondary relationship with another entity owned by Walmart. I guess could you just talk about your appetite therefore to bid for that deal given your experience with this RFP and is there a reason to believe that that process will be handled any differently than this one was?","Margaret Keane","Well, I'll start off by saying there are two separate contracts with two separate program agreements. The programs are different in terms of how they go to market just in terms of the Sam customer and being a little more business related then consumer related. Look we've had a long relationship with Sam's Club as well. That was also a startup. We've actually been with Sam's for 24 years. Look, I think our job right now is to continue to do the utmost servicing, delivering capabilities for Sam's and Walmart. I think at this point of us having that relationship for another year is really critical.","One of the things we have to do as a company is really make sure we're delivering to the best of our ability for both Walmart and Sam's and then you know we're committed to doing that. And I think it's really important that we treat these customers really well. We're going to continue to be in Walmart stores. We're going to continue to be in Sam's Clubs and it's important for my team, our teams to deliver the best possible service we can do and continue to innovate with Sam's.","So we're not going step back from that. So we would hope to renew Sam's and we're going to be in that process, we'll be aggressive and you know again I think the important point here is we don't have a bad relationship with Walmart. Our team has worked really well together with Walmart and Sam\u2019s. So we're going to leverage that and continue to leverage that and we're going to really take the high road here and make sure we do the best we possibly can for the programs.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And I also just want to follow up on your answer to the last question for Moshe, just in terms of, I guess are you saying that the other issuers were just able to do the deal at lower economics than you were willing to go to and wasn't anything else? And then just maybe separately just in terms of offsetting the costs on this specific deal, how long can that continue to happen if other deals were to go the way Walmart did?","Margaret Keane","So I would say look, we can't really comment on like the final negotiations between Walmart and Cap One. What we can tell you is that in our heart of hearts, we believe we have the same if not better capabilities. We could have delivered on all fronts that Walmart wanted us to deliver on. We just could not get there in terms of what our economic expectation was for the program.","And I'd say that when you look at our other partners and our other renewals coming out we're very confident that this was a unique situation. We believe that our partners are valuing what we're delivering for them every single day. We continue to have partners come here in our innovation stations and in our offices in Chicago looking at all the capabilities we're delivering and we have confidence that we will be able to renew those relationships that are in the pipeline.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning guys.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Maybe as a follow up on Sanjay\u2019s question, Margaret, I was just wondering can you talk about any efforts to accelerate with the renewal schedule of your next three or four biggest partners who are set to mature the next few years? I know in the past you've said you're always working towards renewal, but I was wondering if there's a specific effort to accelerate the renewal similar to what we saw another company do in the cobranded space after big partner lost that? ","Margaret Keane","I would say Ryan, we're always looking to renew and I wouldn't necessarily say we're accelerating, but I would tell you we're having very good conversations with our partners in terms of what they're looking for from a value proposition perspective, how they're looking to transform their digital footprint and what we can do for them. So I feel very positive that we'll continue to have a good track record and show as we've done historically that we can renew our deals.","Ryan Nash","Got it and then just two small follow ups, first does Walmart loss it all change the strategic direction of the company and in particular make you think about a more diversified strategy such as being less reliant on individual partners and maybe it causes your return thresholds to differ as a more diversified company?","And then second, just for the capital you're deploying the $2.5 billion in share repurchase or other higher returning options, if you maybe expand on what some of those other options would be and would that include M&A? Thanks for taking my questions.","Margaret Keane","Sure, I will answer the first part and give the second part to Brian. So we are looking to diversify the business and we've actually been doing that. I think in particular, if you look at our PayPal and CareCredit business which are really both fast growing entities, we have lots of opportunity to diversify and continue to build out those platforms. And as a matter of fact as we do our 2019 planning we're really looking at ways to accelerate our opportunities in both of those platforms. We see tremendous opportunity with CareCredit and we're going to really leverage that platform to help us diversify the company.","Brian Doubles","And then I would just add to that, obviously we're going to do that in a way where we're very disciplined around our return profile. So as we think about diversification, payment solutions, CareCredit, are great ways to diversify out of large program concentrations that we have today at very attractive returns. General purpose card is another way to diversify.","Obviously we started to build out that strategy a little bit with what we did on Toys\"R\"Us. Depending on how Walmart goes, we would continue potentially down that path, and I think that's a nice way to diversify the portfolio at the same time doing it at very attractive returns. And then sorry Ryan, do you have one more?","Ryan Nash","Yes I have just a follow up on you talked about $2.5 billion in share repurchase or other high returning options, I was just hoping maybe could you expand on what those options were and would it include M&A?","Brian Doubles","Yes, so primarily that's bigger investments in some of our really fast growing programs, Amazon, T.J.Maxx, obviously PayPal, as well as investments in CareCredit payment solutions. But lastly I think we will take a harder look at M&A opportunities. We have a very active process around that. We've always had a very active process around that. We're very disciplined in that sense though around price and valuation. So I think you will see us take a harder look at that, but we're going to maintain our discipline and look for attractive entry points and good returns for shareholders.","Ryan Nash","Thanks for the color.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","And our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Donald Fandetti","Brian, a couple of questions around credit, on PayPal, can you talk a little bit about what percentage of that reserve bill is done in Q3 and sort of how the remainder will play out? I know you've talked about it in the past, but could you clarify that?","And then also how much of a mark was on the PayPal portfolio? And then sort of a follow up to credit, it looks like the 30+ delinquencies in the core portfolio as why clearly trending while they're down year-over-year, but I think the later stage delinquencies didn't see that kind of improvement just want to get your thoughts on that?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure Don. Let me start with your last question because I think that kind of leads into some of what we're expecting to see on the reserves in the second half. So look, second quarter in terms of overall credit came in inline or slightly better than our expectations, so we didn't change our outlook for the full year. But I can tell you we're very encouraged by the delinquency trends that we're seeing across the portfolio.","If you just look at the year-over year trends over the last four quarters, we are running anywhere between 27 basis points up to 54 basis points up and we saw our 30+ delinquencies come down year-over-year and now down 8 basis points. So we feel really good about what we're seeing on the portfolio. You obviously saw that flow through and a reserve build that was $121 million compared to our expectation of around $175 million.","So things are trending in the right direction, vintages look good, we're seeing a good mix in terms of the sales. We're still seeing really good growth on sales on accounts above 720 FICO. So things trending in line and we feel if anything second quarter came in a little bit better than our expectation.","In terms of the 90+ question they you had, we've always for the last year have been pretty clear that you're obviously going to see a first in 30+ then you're going to see at 90+ and then you'll see it in net charge offs. So this quarter you clearly saw it come through in 30+. We would expect 90+ next quarter, the quarter after and then obviously net charge offs are going to start to level off as well in the second half which is very much in line with what we said a year ago when we started just some of those modest tightening, so that's credit generally.","So let me switch to the reserves and in terms of PayPal, so you have to remember on PayPal that you know the portfolio comes on without any reserves. It comes on at fair value, so we have to build that reserve basically from zero, the bulk of which occurs over the first nine to 12 months.","And we will take more of that in the third quarter, it will come down a bit, in the fourth, will give you a sense for what we think that looks like next quarter. And then continue to build that reserve into the first half of 2019, but at smaller amounts. Obviously then you're going to see in the third quarter. So it's a little bit of a sliding scale, you take more of it upfront. The majority of that reserve is built within the first year.","Donald Fandetti","And was there I guess, was there was a pretty modest mark on the portfolio for sort of [indiscernible].","Brian Doubles","Oh yes, sorry that was the last question, yes it was a pretty modest mark. If you go back to the guidance that we put out in January, you can see with and without PayPal our net charge off rate was unchanged at 55 to 58. So while there is a slight mark on PayPal it doesn't move us off of our full year NCO guidance.","Donald Fandetti","Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. So we've been hearing some skepticism from investors about the $300 million to $350 million of expense sales you've identified in your strategic options, could you just kind of walk us through where you see those expenses sales coming from?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. The easiest way to think about this is those are the expenses that are really associated with the program. So you've got a combination of directly attributable costs related to the program and the portfolio and then you've got a portion of fixed costs that will come out as we right size the business for the portfolio leaving.","So it's actually, it's fairly straightforward. I mean when we look at the business and we actually have, but we haven't had a lot of time to work on this. We have a fairly detailed plan. By function and we know where the costs come out when we look at right sizing the business for the portfolio moving.","Mark DeVries","Okay, got it. And then I was hoping you could clarify what's meant by both options being accretive to EPS relative to renewal terms. I'm assuming that means relative to the dilution you would have suffered under the economics that you would have had to accept to renew, but can you comment on whether this is also accretive to what you know consensus numbers might be for 2019 or 2020?","Brian Doubles","Well, obviously I can't comment on the consensus, but what I can tell you is we know kind of where we stopped in the negotiating process and when we look at these two alternatives relative to that, these two options are EPS accretive. Does that make sense?","Mark DeVries","Yes, okay but am I correct in my reading that it's - you're just saying it's accretive to what EPS would have been pro forma under the terms that you would have had to accept to renew?","Brian Doubles","We believe it would have taken to renew, I think importantly though if you put that point aside, either of these options replace the EPS of the program. So EPS neutral to what the program was earning and accretive to what we believe a renewal would have cost us.","Mark DeVries","Understood. Okay, thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yep.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Good morning. Thanks for taking mine as well. A question focusing on maybe helping us better understand the stickiness of these programs in light of the renewal process and specifically. My understanding is that one of your public competitors has noted in the past that for non-cobrand for pure store card programs, they own all the data, the skew level transaction data, not the retailer. And I guess it's a three-part question. One is for your pure store card programs, do you own all of that data? Secondly, is there any data you retain that's yours not to retailers in dual card programs? And then thirdly maybe just remind us about the mix between the two for balances?","Margaret Keane","So the retailer owns the data on the card programs. We do not own that data. I would say on dual card it\u2019s little different because there is in-store and out of store, so we do get the out of store data. And your third question was?","David Scharf","Oh I\u2019m sorry, just I guess an update maybe pro forma Walmart terminating maybe with a mix of balances between a pure store card program versus dual card?","Margaret Keane","I'll let Brian, answer that.","Brian Doubles","So one other important point just on the data, so while the data is owned by the retailer or the program, we own all of the data analytics. We owned all the data models. We own all of the, what we consider data capabilities on the program. So the data moves but all of the analytics horse power and the capabilities obviously remain with us.","David Scharf","And then just in terms\u2026","Brian Doubles","Does that make sense?","David Scharf","Yes, no, no, no, that's very helpful. Yes.","Brian Doubles","Yes, the mix specifically, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re asking specifically on Walmart, but Walmart is split roughly 50-50 dual card private label and then if you look at the split of spend on dual card it's about 60% of the spend is actually outside Walmart.","David Scharf","Yes and actually if possible I was more curious on the mix pro forma Walmart leaving kind of the rest of the portfolio.","Brian Doubles","It wouldn\u2019t change the mix of the company dramatically. it wouldn\u2019t significantly change that mix at all.","David Scharf","Okay, thanks very much.","Brian Doubles","Yep","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with J.P. Morgan.","Rick Shane","Hey guys thanks for taking my question this morning. Hey Brian, when you walked through the Walmart numbers what you show was that proportionately NCOs are high, proportionally yields are high, proportionally RSAs are low. I'm curious proportionately about purchase volume and portfolio growth, so we can think about how to take that out going forward?","Brian Doubles","Yes, I would think about absent Walmart that we're still back to our more historical growth rate. I don't think it changes our view on what we can do from a core growth standpoint. So I don't think it changes that mix either in terms of purchase volume, active accounts or receivables growth rate for the company.","Rick Shane","And there's nothing unique related to Walmart in the relationship between purchase volume and loan growth?","A - Brian Doubles","There's not. I mean you can infer some things from what we've indicated on what it does to our loss or a little bit more of a revolving nature in that portfolio, but other than that it wouldn't be dramatic. And you have to remember I think importantly if the Walmart portfolio comes out in that scenario we just brought on PayPal which is a very high growth portfolio. So you have to think about those too kind of in conjunction. They are similarly sized programs. One is certainly you know what the growth rate is on PayPal because it's been disclosed over the last couple of years, very high growth, lots of opportunity going forward, so you've got to factor that in as well.","Rick Shane","Okay, got it. Thank you very much.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ken Bruce with Bank of America.","Kenneth Bruce","Thank you, good morning. Of the two options that you pointed out for the Walmart portfolio, do you have a preference for one outcome or the other? I understand you're not necessarily in control of it, but do you have a preference for which one you may be handed and\/or are you agnostic to that and why?","Brian Doubles","Yes, look and we feel pretty good about our ability to execute both options and in either situation we believe we can replace the EPS impact. The options are accretive to a renewal scenario and at this point either option looks attractive to us. We'll obviously know more as we work through the process to determine whether the portfolio is going to move or whether we will retain it. We will also get the more visibility around the potential gain if it's sold. So all of those things will kind of factor in here, but what I can say is that we feel pretty good about our ability to execute either option.","Kenneth Bruce","Okay, well I guess the reason I ask is one obviously you export those customers and the other you retain some part of it to such a degree that you're trying to diversify your business away from that partnership concentration you've got a nice leg into a general purpose card in that case and so I hear that you're interested in building that, the second option may seem like a better alternative, just so I\u2019m just kind of asking if you have a preference one way or the other?","Brian Doubles","That's exactly right. I think that the first option is more straightforward frankly. And the second option has a nice diversification angle to it that we like. And in both cases again we think we can execute either option, we can do it in a way to generates positive EPS result.","Kenneth Bruce","Okay and then that in terms of the discussion around capabilities, I think I understand a lot of that kind of tends to be focused on the technology side of it at least that's how the some of the commentary pre the deal announced last night was being kind of talked about. One of the other aspects of it is credit capabilities in terms of Synchrony is willing this to go deep into a credit file in order to essentially kind of remain in some of these partnerships programs. Do you have any kind of comments there or thoughts around how, what your willingness is in order to expand that credit box to be able to remain competitive in these situations?","Margaret Keane","You know, I think Brian said this before, I've said it before, for us it's really around the overall return of the program and we look at each of these contracts and programs and partnerships on that whole risk reward base. And I think in this case it was unique and we could not get to the overall return of the portfolio for Walmart that would mean what we thought was a return that we were willing to take. So I don't think it's really about the credit box, it's really about the overall return on a program and our ability to deliver for the partner.","Brian Doubles","Yes, I mean as we said in the past like we have general underwriting guidelines that we apply across the entire business, but we also customize our underwriting by program by platform. So it's never been a one size fits all approach. We manage our programs to different loss rates based on the overall return as Margret said, that we're trying to achieve and we can do that in our programs using the customized underwriting. But at some point if you're not getting the return for the credit risk, you're taking then you know that becomes unattractive.","Kenneth Bruce","Right, so you didn't tighten the box around the Walmart program and that might have kind of lead to that decision?","Brian Doubles","No, I would not assume that. I mean the credit actions that we took over the past year and a half were fairly modest frankly and while they're having the desired result they were applied across pretty much the entire business.","Kenneth Bruce","Okay, thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Brian, my question is has to do with your debt spreads, it looks like they've moved out about 40 or 50 basis points since July when I guess the Walmart things start to be discussed in a public market, can you just talk about the funding environment for you right now and if that spread widening creates any concerns or changes your outlook for funding cost over the near to medium term?","Brian Doubles","Yes, it really doesn't create much of a concern for us. I think they are wider by maybe 35 basis points. We're very focused though as you know on deposit growth. That's our most attractive funding source. We're still seeing really good growth on deposits. We got very a strong franchise there that we continue to build out. So I think like any pressure that we see in the fixed income spreads in the unsecured or secured markets, we think we can offset and with higher deposit growth. So overall we don't think that's a big impact to how to think about net interest margins going forward.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay, thanks very much.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Matthew O'Neill with Autonomous Research. ","Matthew O'Neill","Yes, hi thanks for taking my question. Brian, I think in the last two calls you\u2019ve given some additional commentary around spend growth sort of parsed by kind of high cycle bucket and low cycle bucket, I don't know if you'd be willing to give us an update on that?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So very consistent this quarter with prior quarters, if you look at purchase volume by FICO stratification we continue to see really good growth in that 721 plus FICO range. So sales on those accounts was up 8% this quarter versus the prior year and then purchase volume on accounts below 650 FICO declined 13%, so very similar to prior periods. And again that's a - we still expect that to be a relatively short term phenomenon. I think we'll start to lap that in the first half of 2019 and you'll see that influence our overall growth rate for the company in a positive way.","Matthew O'Neill","Got it and thanks. As a follow up I was hoping you could maybe just talk a little bit more about the strategic direction around potentially getting further into general purpose card issuance, it makes sense around the Toys\"R\"Us portfolio and obviously if you were to retain the Synchrony portfolio and sorry the Walmart portfolio and start turning that into general purpose card you'd be more weighted in that direction versus some probably earlier comments about it being a bit of a competitive advantage with certain retailers that you guys aren\u2019t also kind of focused on your own general purpose card and the retailers partner card, just wondering what you think about that sort of dynamic going forward?","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. So look I think we're always interested in pursuing diversification opportunities if we can do it at attractive returns. And as we look at adjacencies to what we do today, this is a pretty close adjacency. So we think there's you know minimal execution risk. As you said, it's pretty competitive out there, particularly in the higher end, so I don't think that's where we would play, but we think we can carve out a very profitable niche for ourselves here.","We're pretty confident given what the early returns on Toys\"R\"Us and some of the trends that we're seeing there that we can develop an attractive value proposition that works for a segment of the population. So we're seeing better activation on that portfolio than we thought we would. We're seeing good usage and so we think that this is a strategy for us longer term.","We're going to be cautious and careful around it. We're going to continue to test on the accounts that we have today. And then as you think about you know that second option for Walmart, we do think that in that scenario we can convert a fairly significant number of those customers to a general purpose card.","As I said earlier, about 50% of the Walmart portfolio today is a dual card, so they're kind of acting like a general purpose card already. And if you look at the spend on those cards it's about 60% outside of Walmart. So that gives us some comfort that there is a population there that we can convert and would be very receptive to a Synchrony branded card with a very attractive value proposition.","Margaret Keane","And average of bad debt we have plenty of experience of people from the industry in our team and on our teams, so we're confident that we have the capability to really execute on that.","Matthew O'Neill","Understood, thanks for the time.","Greg Ketron","Hey Vanessa, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you, Sir. Our last question is from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thank you, good morning. Does the focus on returning the $2.5 billion freed up by Walmart under the sale option in any way delay your ability to return the other call it roughly $2 billion of excess capital that you have or would you make every effort to get that out by 2019 as well? And in response to the earlier question about whether some of that, a portion of the $2.5 billion could be used for other alternatives, could you just confirm that spending on any other alternatives would not delay the replacement of the lost EPS?","Brian Doubles","That's right. So were viewing the $2.5 billion as incremental to what we would have otherwise gone and asked for as part of a capital plan. So while we may include a portion of it in a capital plan in order to get formal approval from the board and our regulators, we are viewing that as incremental. We do expect to execute it in 2019. We think it will be done in the second half of 2019. We've had preliminary discussions with our board and our regulators on it. Obviously there will be a formal approval process that we have to go back around, but at this point we do feel pretty good about our ability to execute it.","Bill Carcache","Okay and then as a follow up, is there anything unique to the Walmart portfolio that allows you guys to fully offset its loss via buyback and to what extent would you be able to summarily offset the loss of other portfolios if they were to happen?","Brian Doubles","Without getting too specific, I think in all of these cases whether it's Toys\"R\"Us, whether it's Walmart we have options at our disposal to offset the EPS impact or at least mitigate a substantial portion of it through the strategies or similar strategies that we've outlined here for Walmart. So look, I think what's important is we have options available. We can execute those options. We feel comfortable with them and they give us a nice EPS offset.","Bill Carcache","So contractually like it is just reasonable to conclude that your agreements broadly speaking put you in a position to be able to mitigate the loss of any portfolio should they happen is the general rule?","Brian Doubles","Most of our contracts would play out similar to this one in that either the portfolio moves to a new issuer or we retain it and we would run a similar strategy to what we're proposing here and convert the cards to a Synchrony branded product or I should say you know potentially another program in the company. So it does depend a little bit on the contract, but the financial outcome would be very similar.","Bill Carcache","Got it, thank you very much for taking my questions.","Brian Doubles","Thanks Bill.","Greg Ketron","Okay, thanks everyone for joining us on the call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have.","Operator","And thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference.

You can find a reconciliation of these measures to GAAP financial measures in our materials for today's call.","Finally, Synchrony Financial is not responsible for and does not edit nor guarantee the accuracy of our earnings teleconference transcripts provided by third parties. The only authorized webcasts are located on our website.","Margaret Keane, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Brian Doubles, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, will present our results this morning. After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. As most of you probably know by now, we received approval from the Federal Reserve Board to become a standalone savings and loan holding company, following the completion of GE's proposed exchange offer.","This approval represents a major step forward in Synchrony Financial journey to become a fully independent company. We are very pleased that we have reached this point. I want to thank everyone for all the hard work that has gone into this process, including my team, our employees and the help GE provided to us. We also want to thank the Federal Reserve and our regulators for working with us through this process.","The next step in the process is the exchange offer, where GE will exchange its shares of Synchrony Financial common stock for shares of GE common stock. At this point, we are very limited and what information we can provide around that approval and the exchange offer other than what has been made public. As a result we will not be able to discuss any details around these issues on the call today.","I will begin our discussion today on slide three, third quarter net earnings totaled $574 or $0.69 per share. Overall, strong momentum continued across our business platforms driving significant receivables deposits and revenue growth this quarter. Growth remained robust with purchase volume up 12%, loan receivables growth of 12% and platform revenue growth of 9%.","We continue to offer attractive programs that resonate with customers, such as our Amazon prime card where cardholders receive 5% back, our Sam's Club 531 cash back credit card program below 5% discount on purchases everyday and reward programs with BP and Chevron, in addition to our ongoing promotional event. Our partners work with us as we continually search for innovative ways to drive program growth.","Asset quality improved with 3 basis points decline in our net charge-off rate and a 24 basis points improvement in 30-plus delinquencies. Expenses were in line with our expectations, impacted by investments we made just for growth, separation-related costs and the completion of the EMV card rollout for active Dual Card holders.","Deposit growth continued at a very strong pace, with deposit increasing $8 billion or 24% over the third quarter of last year. Deposits now comprise 63% of our funding, moving further into our target range of 60% to 70%. Our ongoing efforts to provide increasing value to our deposit with new features and enhancements are yielding notable results.","Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 17.5%, calculated on a transitional basis and liquid assets totaling $15 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter end.","Key business highlights during the quarter included the extension of key existing contracts, including PayPal, one of our top 10 partners, the signing of two new partners, extension of our CareCredit network and further advancement of our technology platform to enhance the engagement experience with our customers.","We are pleased to announce a long-term expansion with PayPal to provide Dual Cards to consumer. Our program with PayPal dates back to 2004 and these programs enable digital and mobile payments to online and offline merchants for qualifying cardholders. We're excited to expand our decade-long relationship with PayPal who is at the forefront of digital payment.","We are also pleased to have renewed our partnership with Sleepy\u2019s, the third largest mattress retailer in United States, further enhancing the number of top retailers where we provide financing in the bedding space.","Regarding new partners we have signed a multiyear agreement with Citgo, a leading U.S. refiner and marketer to provide a private label credit card program for new and existing customers.","We expect to launch the program in the first quarter of 2016 and Citgo cardholders will be able to earn rewards and save on fuel purchases at any of the nearly 5,500 locally-owned and operated Citgo locations in U.S.","In addition, we are pleased to announce a new partnership with The Container Store, the nation's leading retailer of storage and organization products. This is a multiyear agreement to offer private label credit card program and the card will be available fees in the retailer's stores and online. The program is scheduled to launch in the spring of 2016.","Additionally, we expanded our CareCredit network through a new agreement with Rite Aid, one of the nation's leading drugstore chain. Rite Aid will accept our CareCredit card for in-store purchases and health services in their nearly 4,600 stores nationwide. We also added a new multiyear agreement with Premier Dental Holding, one of the nation's largest dental provider.","We're very excited about this new and extended partnership and our ability to add significant value to these relationships. Driving organic growth continues to be a key source of future opportunity and we continue to pursue initiatives to help card usage and deepen penetration across all of our partnerships.","As we have noted in the past, the online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business. As reflected in our 2015 digital study, a comprehensive mobile strategy essential to the ability of retailers to effectively engage with our customers. In our national survey, we found that 45% of shoppers are now shopping with the mobile device and this is up 4 percentage points from last year.","Additionally, one-third are purchasing products after viewing them on social media and one-third indicate that tax offers will drive an incremental shopping visit. Given these trends, we have been active in capitalizing on this evolving environment. Our digital strategies have helped drive an increase in online and mobile purchase volume, which is up 21% from last year and nearly a third of our credit applications are now done through digital channels. The adoption of our digital card also continues at a healthy pace.","We continue to progress in our leading mobile wallet strategy and we are very pleased to be among the first issuers to offer private label cardholders the ability to add their cards to Samsung Pay, which launched in late September. We have currently enabled the use of over 12 million active accounts across our CareCredit and payment solutions platform and we intend to build on this.","As many of you know, we have Dual Cards enabled and will be one of the first issuers with the capacity to offer private label credit cards through Apple Pay. Through our innovation and strategic partnerships, we are helping to shape the future of how private label card function in mobile world and provide value to our merchants and their customers. We have developed a mobile platform that can be rapidly integrated across retails and wallets.","The speed at which we've been able to develop the capability for our cards to be in mobile wallet while maintaining the benefits for both our cardholders and partners speaks to our commitment to being at the forefront of this evolving payment landscape and our ability to capitalize on our leadership position.","Moving to slide four which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 12%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 12% and average active account growth of 4%. The addition of the BP program last quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue was up 9% over the third quarter of last year. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing offers.","On the next slide, I'll discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail. We continue to drive strong performance across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter. Retail card had very strong performance this quarter generating purchase volume of 12% and receivables growth of 13%. The addition of BP last quarter also contributed to the growth rate. Platform revenue growth was 10%.","In addition to our new agreement with Citgo, we continue to expand our brand distribution with the launch of the Athleta credit program, one of the brand names on the gap. In addition to adding new partners that are a good strategic fit, renewing and extending our programs is a key priority in this business. Within the long-term extension of our program with PayPal, we now have nearly 92% of our retail card receivables that are under contract through 2019 and beyond.","The strong position we maintain in this state and the collaborative partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for further growth. Payment solution delivered another strong quarter. Purchase volume growth was 13% and loan receivables growth totaled 12% driving platform revenue growth of 8%. Average active accounts increased 8% over the last year.","The majority of our industries have positive growth in both purchase volumes and receivables, with particular strength in home furnishing and automotive products. We exhibited significant success in finding multiple new partners this quarter, including the container store and our pipeline remains strong.","We also launched new program this quarter, most notably Guitar Center, which included a portfolio conversion from another issuer and now gives us a preeminent position as a key financing partner in the music retail market. As noted, we extended our long-term relationship with BP. As a result of this, coupled with the announcement of MattressFirm in this summer, we now have programs with each of the top four bidding retailers in the U.S.","CareCredit had a solid quarter and entered into important new agreement. Purchase volume was up 13% and average active accounts increased 5%, helping to drive receivables growth of 5% and platform revenue growth of 3% over the same quarter of last year. Receivable growth this quarter was led by dental and veterinary specialties.","Regarding the new agreement, the agreement with Rite Aid will extend the facility of our CareCredit card to nearly 4600 Rite Aid stores nationwide and the agreement with Premier Dental Holdings which has nearly 200 clinics with nearly 1 million consumers in the western part of the U.S. will result in the origination and the acceptance of CareCredit card in their offices. Plans are in place to launch CareCredit, native application in the fourth quarter, which will feature the CareCredit digital card and be available to cardholders via the Apple and Google Play app stores.","In summary, each platform delivered solid growth and continue to make progress in the signing of new partnership and the extension of existing programs while continuing to drive organic growth.","I'll now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter.","Brian Doubles","Thanks Margaret. I\u2019ll start on slide six of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $574 million net income which translates to $0.69 per diluted share in quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 12%, receivables up 12% and platform revenue up 9%.","Overall, we're pleased with the growth we have generated across the business. We continue to see evidence of the value proposition on our cards are resonating with consumers. Purchase volume per active account was up 8% compared to last year and the average balance per account increased as well. We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition last quarter. So that helped improve our growth rate year-over-year.","Net interest income was up 8% in the quarter. This includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was issued to increase liquidity in the third quarter last year. Interest income was up 9%, which is in line with our average receivables growth.","RSAs were up $30 million or 4% compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.6% for the quarter, which was slightly lower than 4.8% we reported in the third quarter last year. The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due to programs we exited last year where we paid a higher RSA a percentage of average receivable as well as higher loyalty costs that are directly shared through the RSA with our retailers.","For the year, we would expect RSAs as a percentage of receivables to be in the 4.5% range consistent with the prior two years. The provision increased $27 million or 4% compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth, partly offset by the improvement in asset quality. Improvement in asset quality is reflected in lower 30 plus delinquencies, which improved 24 basis points versus last year to 4.02% and in the net charge-off rate, which fell to 4.02%, 3 basis points below last year.","Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was down 15 basis points compared to the third quarter last year to 5.31%. However, measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage remained at 1.27 times virtually the same coverage level as the prior three quarters. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable.","Other income decreased $12 million versus last year, primarily driven by higher loyalty and rewards costs, partially offset by an increase in interchange revenue. More specifically, interchange was up $34 million, driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our dual card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $38 million, primarily driven by new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange in loyalty expense run back to our RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.","Debt cancellation fees of $61 million were down $7 million from last year due to the fact that we only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $115 million versus the third quarter of last year. In addition to the infrastructure build, the majority of the increase was driven by three items.","First, we continued to make investments to support ongoing growth across all of our platforms. Second, we had expenses associated with the rollout of EMV cards for active Dual Card holders. The rollout was completed this quarter ahead of the October liability shift dates.","Lastly, we continued to make strategic investments in our deposit platform and our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 34.2% and 33.3% year to date, which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, we had strong topline growth that drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.9%.","I will move to slide seven and go through our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income growth was strong at 8%. Interest and fees on loan receivables was up 8%, partially offset by higher interest expense, driven by growth and the additional liquidity we're carrying on the balance sheet compared to last year.","The net interest margin declined to 15.97%, which was fairly consistent with prior quarters and better than the outlook we provided back in January. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, 77 basis points was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio.","We increased liquid assets on the balance sheet to $15.3 billion, which is up $1.2 billion versus last year. We have the cash invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the fed, which results in a lower yield than the rest of our earning assets. The yield on our receivables is down 33 basis points compared to last year. This was a result of slightly higher payment rates and the impact of portfolio mix, given the strong growth in promotional balances on our payment solutions platform.","Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.8%, up 9 basis points compared to last year. This was in line with our expectations given the changes in our funding profile. I will walk you through a breakdown by funding source.","First, the cost of our deposits was relatively stable at 1.6%, the same level as the third quarter last year. Our deposit base increased nearly $8 billion, or 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 63% of our funding, which is in line with the target we set between 60% and 70%.","Securitization funding costs were relatively flat at 1.6%. Our other debt costs increased 53 basis points to 2.9%, due to the higher mix of bank term loans and unsecured bonds compared to last year. While the third quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans.","As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margins and expect them to decline slightly due to the seasonal build up in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year.","Next, I will cover our key credit trends on slide eight. As I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to improving trends on asset quality. 30 plus delinquencies were 4.02%, down 24 basis points versus last year. 90 plus delinquencies were 1.73%, down 12 basis points. We continued to believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends compared to last year.","The net charge-off rate also improved to 4.02%, down 3 basis points versus last year. And lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.31%, which was down 15 basis points from the prior year. If you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months charge-offs, we're currently at 1.27 times coverage, which equates to roughly 15 months lost coverage in our reserve. And as I noted earlier, this is very consistent with prior quarters.","Looking to the fourth quarter, we typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and the decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables due to holiday spending in the seasonal build on receivables. So overall, we continued to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends we are seeing.","Moving to slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses continued to be in line and we're delivering on our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year. Year-to-date through the third quarter, we are at 33.3%. Expenses came at $843 million for the quarter and compared to last year, largely driven by separation-related costs and growth of the business. And as I mentioned earlier, we also had approximately $20 million in expenses related to the EMV card rollout this quarter.","Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $29 million as we've added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of new business. Professional fees were up $13 million due to both, separation-related costs and growth.","Marketing and business development costs were flat, as we had increases driven by investments in the growth of our retail programs, as well as marketing associated with our direct deposit products. These increases were offset by lower spend on brand advertising. Information processing was up $30 million, driven by higher IT investments and in the increase in transactions and purchase line compared to last year.","Other increased $43 million versus prior year, primarily driven by growth in the infrastructure build. As we noted last quarter, the costs associated with the infrastructure build are now largely reflected in our run rate and total expenses remain in line with our expectations. We expect to finish the year within our efficiency ratio guidance of below 34% for the year.","Moving to slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first. One of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We continued to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by nearly $8 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program.","This puts deposits at 63% of our funding, which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. And while we now move further within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of the deposit base, including the rollout of new products later next year such as checking and online bill pay.","Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $14 billion to $15 billion range, which is approximately 21% of our funding. We did issue $600 million in securitization bonds in September with three and five-year maturities. This is consistent with our approach to maintain this source of funding at between 15% to 20% of our total funding. We also issued $1 billion in tenure fixed rate senior unsecured notes in July.","As we\u2019ve said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility, as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business compared to deposits and other lower cost funding sources. We have continued to pay this down during the quarter, making a $500 million prepayment in August.","Since the IPO, we have paid down the bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $4.7 billion today and expect to continue to pay this down in future quarters. Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We'll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility.","Turning to capital and liquidity. We ended the quarter at 17.5% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 16.6% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. Total liquidity increased to $21.9 billion and includes $15.3 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.6 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 28% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.","Overall, we are executing on the strategy that we outlined previously. We\u2019ve built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels.","And with that, I will turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I will close the summary of the quarter on slide 11 and then move again with the Q&A portion of the call.","During the quarter we exhibited broad-based growth across several key areas making progress on several fronts and continuing the momentum that we have generated over the last several quarters. We continue to win and renew important partnerships as well as opportunities to expand our network and the utility of our cards, and our pipeline of additional opportunities remains strong. Our digital wallet strategy continues to deliver meaningful partnerships with attractive opportunities. Our innovation and adaptability enabled us to be among the first private label issuers to make our cards and their functionality available through Samsung Pay. We are pleased with the ongoing success of our fast growing deposit platform.","And finally with the fed approval to become a standalone savings and loan holding company, we look ahead to the next step in this process, the proposed exchange offer. Again, I want to acknowledge all of the hard work that has gone into this process. We are proud of having achieved the important step in our progress towards separation. As I noted earlier, we are restricted in what we can say today, but please stay tuned on this front as additional details on the exchange offer become available.","I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good morning. Congrats on getting the approval from the fed. Just reading through that 17-page order, I didn\u2019t notice any language around CCAR and I understand you\u2019re approved as a savings and loan holding company. Does that mean that CCAR doesn\u2019t apply to you guys? And if yes, what exactly is the process of getting to return capital to shareholders? And also maybe taking liquidity down from the levels that you have it? Thanks.","Margaret Keane","Sure. Good morning, Sanjay. It\u2019s Margaret. So I will hand it over to Brian, but I just wanted to just reiterate how important this milestone was for us and getting the separation from GE really is the biggest part of the milestone. Brian is really going to take you through a little bit of learning around CCAR and where we\u2019re going to go forward on that.","Brian Doubles","Yes. So Sanjay, you\u2019re absolutely right, there is nothing in the order that specifically subjects us to the CCAR process. And we\u2019ve discussed in the past because we\u2019re savings and loan holding company and not a bank holding company, we\u2019re not technically subject to the CCAR process. So, that\u2019s where we stand as of today.","With all that said, it\u2019s still our expectation that we\u2019re going to file a capital plan with the fed. And it\u2019s going to be based on the fed\u2019s CCAR assumptions. So it\u2019s very likely that even though we\u2019re not part of the public process, we are going to follow a very similar process to the upper banks in terms of using the same assumptions, following the same timeline and we think that gives us probably the best chance of success in 2016. So that it\u2019s going to look similar, but you\u2019re not going to see it as part of the formal public process.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. And this is part, the liquidity is concerned. And just one follow-up. So does that mean that you would just put through your own assumption -- you would follow the assumptions of CCAR through your own model?","Brian Doubles","That\u2019s our indication\u2026","Sanjay Sakhrani","Right.","Brian Doubles","\u2026 exactly, so we would\u2026","Sanjay Sakhrani","Yeah.","Brian Doubles","We would grab those assumptions when they\u2019re published in February. We will run those through our models. We\u2019d formulate a capital plan. We\u2019d submit that to the fed. It\u2019s just one the part of the public process, that\u2019s our expectation as we say here today.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay. Great.","Brian Doubles","So that\u2019s capital. You asked about liquidity as well. I think the liquidity is going to be consistent with what we said in the past. I think we feel like we\u2019ve got more than adequate liquidity today. I think we\u2019ve got a couple opportunities to optimize the amount of liquidity that we\u2019re holding. We\u2019ve also got an opportunity I think to look at different ways to invest that excess cash.","You\u2019ve seen us do that a little bit all year where we run our internal models, we look at rating agency considerations, regulatory considerations. We look at our maturities coverage. And to the extent that we have, we feel we have some excess liquidity. You\u2019ve seen us use that to prepay the bank term loan. You\u2019re going to continue to see us do that. That\u2019s part of the reason obviously why our net interest margin has trended better than the guidance we provided back in January. But I wouldn\u2019t expect going forward to see a step change in how we manage liquidity.","The regulatory considerations are just one piece of the puzzle. We add up all the other considerations, our internal models and that\u2019s where we used to size the amount of liquidity we have. So I think there is some opportunity there, but it\u2019s going to be more around the margin, it\u2019s not going to be a step change from what we\u2019re doing today.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning, everyone. And congrats on getting approval.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","I guess for starters, your loan growth is coming well above the 6% to 8% that your outlook had called for. I was wondering maybe can you give us a breakdown, and how much of the growth is coming from actually improved penetration rates versus portfolio wins? And as you look forward clearly the PayPal renews big way from you, but how should we think about your ability to sustain loan growth at or near the current rates?","Brian Doubles","Yes, Ryan, most of the loan growth year-to-date has been organic, core organic growth and that\u2019s really tendership, that\u2019s the value props that we\u2019ve launched at Sam's Club and Amazon. And the only portfolio acquisition we\u2019ve done which impacted the results of our year-to-date is BT, which we closed in the second quarter and obviously impact -- continues to impact our results in the third quarter when you look year-over-year.","So I think the fundamentals are very strong. As you pointed out, we are ahead of where we thought we would be back in January. We still got the holiday season that\u2019s going to largely determine where we end up for the year, this is the forecast or somewhere between 3% and 4% similar to what we thought last year. So we\u2019re optimistic.","And when you break down the components of the growth, the underlying trends are positive too. So we are saying purchase volume for active account was up 8%. When you look at the average balance per active account, that was up 5%. So when you break down the different components, the fundamentals are strong as well. I will turn it over to Margaret to talk about PayPal.","Margaret Keane","Yes. So we\u2019re really excited about the PayPal extension. As I have said in the past, we\u2019ve had a really good partnership, a long-term partnership with PayPal since 2004. And I think they were working through their strategy, we\u2019re working through our strategy. We continue to have a really good dialogue through that process. And as a result of some good thinking on both sides, we\u2019ve come together and we will be extending our partnership. So it\u2019s a win for them, a win for us, and we feel pretty excited about being able to keep them.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And maybe if I could just ask one question on the margin. When I think about how it\u2019s trended over the past year or so, it\u2019s obviously come down, but clearly better than expectations had been. And when you think about it, you\u2019ve had call the 30 basis points direct from yields and 70 from the big liquidity belt. But when I think about the comments that you made Brian on the ability to optimize some by investing some of the cash, if we were to assume that yields do continue to come down in the loan book, is there enough deployment for you to do such that you can largely offset a lot of the core pressure on the margin and we can may be see a margin level that\u2019s similar to the performance that you\u2019ve had thus far in 2015 as we look forward?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Ryan, here is the couple of things. Let me just start with one, one of your promises is that loan yield will continue to come down. I think one other things that we\u2019ve seen year-to-date when we look at the loan yields that have come down primarily driven by higher payment rates, which we\u2019re obviously getting a benefit when we look at 30 plus, 90 plus and charge-off performance year-to-date.","So to the extent that loss performance kind of levels out from here then we would expect loan yield to level off as well and we might not see that deterioration. So I think that that just one kind of starting point.","We\u2019ve also when you look at the loan yield, part of that is also driven by just a really strong growth in payment solutions and we\u2019re putting that volume on as largely promotional financing, so it\u2019s coming on at the lower yield initially. And then as those accounts start to revolve, we expect a little bit of lift there in the yield.","On liquidity, I think, there is nothing that we see that is going to result in margins coming down significantly from where they are today. They have performed better year-to-date because we\u2019ve been able to use them, what we view is access to pay down the more expensive performance of financing.","We\u2019re going to continue to do that. We still got a big chunk to go on the bank term loan. So I think we still have some opportunity there and then, I think, we\u2019ve got a little bit of opportunity on the -- how that cash is invested. So you\u2019re going to see us continue to optimize that in terms of more specific outlook. So we\u2019re going to give you some guidance on the January call for 2016 and we can be a little more specific then.","Ryan Nash","Great. Thanks for taking my question.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","And thank you, our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yeah. Thanks. Just a follow-up question on the CCAR process, since you will be opting into that kind of voluntarily not going to the public process, will that impact, asking all in terms of capital returns? Could we expect something potentially in excess of what peers might be asking for?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Mark, I just will be careful that we\u2019re not opting into CCAR. What we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re filing a capital plan using the CCAR assumptions. And the reason we\u2019re doing that is pretty straightforward. The Fed has the process. They measure all the other banks on and similar banks of our size and we think that our best chance to success is to be measured kind of on the same basis and so that\u2019s why we\u2019re doing it.","But I wouldn't view it as opting and we just think that we\u2019re trying to take what we feel is the path here to gives us the best chance to success and I think following the Fed framework and the process that they have allows us to do that.","We\u2019re not going to be specific around our capital ask the first time out. What I would tell you though is that, it's more important for us to get a dividend approved, a buyback program approved than it is to go on our first time and swing for the fences.","So we\u2019re going to be fairly prudent and I also first time out. And again, we want to have a successful first outing here as opposed to trying to go for something that greater than our peers right out of the case.","Mark DeVries","Okay. But is something comparable to your peers given -- particularly given your even stronger capital position, does that feel reasonable and conservative to you?","Brian Doubles","Mark, I am just -- I'm not going to give you more than that right now.","Mark DeVries","Okay.","Brian Doubles","We\u2019re going to get the assumptions in February. We\u2019re going to run them. We\u2019ve got obviously review it with our Board. We got to go through all of our own internal governance processes and then we\u2019re going to submitted to the Fed. So there is a lot -- there is work to do between now and when we actually submit. That just it be premature to give you any kind of indication at this point.","Mark DeVries","Okay.","Brian Doubles","I will say, obviously, we have a lot of capital when you compares to our peers. The return profiles on our business compares very well to our peers. Those are all real positives for us and we think the long-term capital return presented for this business is significant.","Mark DeVries","Okay. That's helpful. And then just one more follow-up on PayPal, I think, our sense was that you kind of expecting -- who you expecting that to go away, so the fact you\u2019re able to renew it is when? Am I right that you were expecting kind of a 2% to 3% headwind to loan growth and that going away, and therefore, that not going away could be a big help for your loan growth in 2016?","Margaret Keane","Yeah. That\u2019s right.","Brian Doubles","Yeah. PayPal was disclosed as $1.5 billion receivable that was expected to go away towards the end of 2016.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Now we\u2019ll be retaining it.","Mark DeVries","Got it. Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","And thank you, our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. You guys talked about two essential wins. I guess that you probably took away from other issuers both Citgo and Guitar Center. Can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment and kind of what's out there? And how you were able to get those? And what else -- what other areas are you looking at?","Margaret Keane","Sure. So I would say that we feel really good about our pipeline and activity in our pipeline. I think we said in the past, we have seen truly dedicated against all three platforms. There is a competitive environment out there. I don't -- we don\u2019t see it being any worse in the private label space than it\u2019s -- or as competitive maybe as the bigger co-brand deal.","So, we think that the competition is playing in the right areas. I think for us, we\u2019re winning really on capabilities. I think it\u2019s around some of the investments we've made in terms of mobile and analytics and data that are really helping us to win this partnership. I think having a more focused process in the three platforms has also helped us. And frankly, I think the other thing that\u2019s really been interesting for us is since we separated out, I think we\u2019re actually getting cogged in, which is new to us.","So we feel like we're in a really good spot. I think, we said before, we don\u2019t have to win every deal because we grow mostly by organic growth. And so I think it allows us to really be awful on the deals that we do want to get. At the end of the day, the most important thing for us is getting partnerships where we feel like we're bringing value to that partner and then the partners sees that value because that\u2019s really how you make these relationships long term and sticky going forward. So we feel pretty good about the pipeline going forward.","Moshe Orenbuch","Just a follow-up, one of your large partners, Sam's did announce they were going to be taking another card brand and can you talk a little bit about how you can kind of defend against that\u2026?","Margaret Keane","Yeah. Sure. So it\u2019s really not that unusual for merchants to except another network. As matter of fact, Sam\u2019s had already been accepting Amex on their online portal already. I think for us it\u2019s somewhat of an opportunity because if folks start coming in using their Amex card, we have the opportunity to cross sell our card. And I think the uniqueness of the way the card works in Sam\u2019s, our credit card is the membership card, it becomes one.","So it\u2019s really easy for consumers to use or customers to use when they\u2019re in club. And I think the other is we have a fantastic value prop on our Sam\u2019s MasterCard. So we feel --listen, no one likes anyone coming in, right. We look at these things. We have a good discussion. We have a great partnership with Sam\u2019s. We\u2019re very integrated with Sam\u2019s. And in someway this could be an opportunity for us to cross sell.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks, Margaret.","Operator","And thank you, our next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Hi. Good morning. I have a question about the implications from the separation on potentially, expenses and kind of what you can do to drive efficiency gains now that you separate from GE and possibly not being part of CCAR process and having greater transparency and kind of what you need to do on the quality of aspects. Is there any opportunity there?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. David, I wouldn\u2019t think about a significant opportunity there just related to separation. As we\u2019ve said in the past, the infrastructure build costs are now in the run rate. So when you look at the expenses, when you look at just sequential bill from second quarter to third quarter, it was relatively modest, just driven by growth in EMV and we always see a seasonal increase in the third quarter. But the infrastructure build cost and everything that we\u2019ve built to prepare for separation is reflected in the run rate.","And just based on the earlier comments I made, even though we are not technically subject to CCAR, the expectations are going to be similar. They are not going to be exactly the same, but they are going to be similar. And so I think it will be premature to talk about any kind of expense benefit that we expect from this, because we are holding ourselves to the same standards that the fed is holding others too. So we are going to go through a couple rounds here on filing a capital plan and doing liquidity access with the outgoes and maybe there is a longer-term opportunity, but nothing we see in the near-term.","David Ho","Okay. That's helpful. And separately, the renewal with PayPal is obviously a big positive. Can you talk about the implications on maybe the RSA and kind of on marketing expenses and have the upfront impact from that renewal as they are coming, similar economics or worse can you expected? And maybe renewals in general, what would you expect there going forward?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. All the renewals that we've done private with the exception of PayPal are reflected in our run rate, so that -- you can get some broad comment on renewals. On PayPal specifically, we can\u2019t get into the pricing and the economics. But I can tell you that as Margaret said, we are really excited about extending the relationship with PayPal. We are able to do that, return is very attractive for us.","So, we\u2019re going to continue to look to extend these programs. And I think we\u2019re able to do that in a way that\u2019s attractive for us, attractive for PayPal and PayPal customers. And one other things that we are going to do is part of that new relationship is we\u2019re going to upgrade some of the accounts to Dual Cards, a big portion of accounts to Dual Cards, we think that will help us drive growth going forward.","So there's a number of things that we changed in the program, but from our perspective all very much aligned with growing the program and we are going to do that at a return that\u2019s attractive for us.","David Ho","Great. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Don Fandetti","Yes. Sort of building on the same question, Brian on the Amazon Prime deal, can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s progressing? And then secondarily, clearly there have been some mixed economic data points from your numbers, it looks like things were pretty steady. Can you talk about if you\u2019ve seen any sort of ups and downs in credit or spend trends?","Margaret Keane","Maybe I\u2019ll start with where is the consumer spending and where we see the trends and then turn over to the Brian to some of the other points to asked. I think what we\u2019re seeing is that the trend continued to indicate the consumer is getting stronger. Brain will talk a little bit about the credit. We see that getting a little bit better. I think gas prices and unemployment are certainly helping the consumer. I think the consumer is still cautious and they are definitely looking for deals and promotions.","So I think our value props are really playing very favorably to the consumer. The one area that I\u2019ve mentioned before that continues to be performing well are things related to the home. So things like furniture trends are pretty strong. So we feel pretty good about where the consumer is right now. And I think a combination of our marketing, the data analytics, the building out of our mobile capability is really helping us drive some of those volumes.","Don Fandetti","Got it.","Brian Doubles","Yes. So the other question you have was around the Amazon. And I think similar to what we\u2019ve said earlier we\u2019re really excited about the 5% value prop for Prime customers. We\u2019re measuring that every day, we\u2019re looking at the new account flow, we\u2019re looking at the purchase volume. Any time you can make a significant change to a value proposition like we did in Amazon, you want to do that in a way we\u2019re kind of soft launching it.","You are doing a lot of testing control. So you make sure that it\u2019s delivering the economic performance that we expect and it\u2019s a good customer experience for the Amazon cardholders. And so far it\u2019s performing very much in line with our expectations and we are optimistic that we can do some more marketing around that offer here in the near term.","Don Fandetti","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Thanks guys. And somebody down really asked my question but I\u2019ll pursue it little bit more deeply. Obviously, the Amazon value preposition is very compelling. It\u2019s a new program that strikes me as a program that could have a high degree of seasonality given the nature of your partner. Can you just talk about what should we be thinking about in Q4 in terms of potential impact on volume, but more importantly in terms of RSA and provision expense?","Margaret Keane","Why don\u2019t I start off? First of all, I think one of the positives of Amazon 5% for Prime customers it's really encouraging everyday spend. So, I think that\u2019s really what the customer, Amazon is really trying to do. They are trying to get that Prime customer to not only buy big ticket items and things like that but growth seasonal and other things. So the 5% really encourages you to go there to that site versus somewhere else. So, we think that\u2019s really great.","Our business is a seasonal business, so obviously holiday is a big opportunity for us. We\u2019re heading into that. We think that Amazon 5% is going to be just a fantastic offering and we hope to see some broader offering of that as we go into the holiday season. So, I think overall this is a great offering and one that as Brian said, we are really watching because I think as we get into the holiday season, the key for us is really making sure that consumer is getting everything they need and things are working in a right way and that\u2019s why we\u2019ve really been soft for both on our site and the Amazon folks on their site to ensure the experience for the customer is very, very good. I don\u2019t know Brain if you\u2026","Brian Doubles","Yeah. I mean in terms of more specific fourth quarter impact, it's really hard to estimate at this point because obviously, we've got to determine and work out with Amazon to what extent and how broad we are going to go with the marketing in the fourth quarter, what the adoption rate is going to look like, what the spends going to look like and this is very fluid.","As I mentioned earlier, we are monitoring this thing almost hourly with Amazon. Our teams sit with them and they look at the spending patterns, the types of purchases, the repeat purchases. And then from our perspective, from a credit perspective, we are also looking at the population of transactor versus revolvers and the credit mix and through the door population. So there is just a number of factors that we are looking at and I can tell you so far, it's performing in line with our expectations, but it's a little too early to give any kind of specific forecast.","Rick Shane","Okay. Fair enough. Second question, you mentioned in third quarter, $20 million of EMV reissue expense. Can you just help us understand where we are in that process? I\u2019m assuming, you are most of the way through that, but could you just let us know what fourth quarter will look like?","Margaret Keane","We are 100% complete with our active Dual Cards being rolled out for EMV.","Rick Shane","Great. Thank you, guys.","Margaret Keane","Obviously, we will have an ongoing expense as new cards come due but the bulk is just behind us.","Rick Shane","Great. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Jamie Friedman with Susquehanna.","Jamie Friedman","Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Margaret, I think in your opening comments you had discussed that a third of the applications are now coming mobile and online. I guess it's Apple Pay. I was wondering how that helps your business processes. Does it improve the credit quality? Does it improve the data or the speed, if you could talk in that direction that will be helpful?","Margaret Keane","Yeah. I think it is two things. Obviously, the speed part is really good. But I think the other is, we are continually looking at ways to ensure that it\u2019s almost like a seamless process. So for instance, if you were to apply through the Amazon card and you are doing that online, it becomes your preferred card in the wallet. So we are continually looking at ways that how do we get to the speed of the answer, get your card and then make it that card of choice if you will. So that helps us in our positioning.","The other is as customers and our research shows it, as customers in particular are looking to make bigger purchases by being able to put an online offers out there in terms of discount depending on the promotion or type of thing they are purchasing, the ability for you to apply and buy right online, while you are looking at those items is really a big opportunity for us. So I think that\u2019s another big area of focus for us.","And then lastly, I think, as we continue to look at how people are shopping, the mobile channel and online it just become a much bigger part of how people are really looking to purchase.","So being -- it\u2019s a combination of thing. It\u2019s really having that application processes really seamless, but then connecting your marketing offers to make that customer really realize, oh, I can get a bigger item or I can get a bigger basket, if I get X card from any of our retailers, because I have credit available to me and that\u2019s really a combination of all the things we are really trying to play out.","Jamie Friedman","And I also want to ask about currency or MCX, they\u2019ve seem to be finally make some progress? There has been a couple of trades that have tracked their introductions in the market just this month? I was wondering if you could give us an update as to where you stand with them, I know that you have partnerships in place, but some sort of visibility would be helpful?","Margaret Keane","Yeah. We, obviously, we have Samsung and Wal-Mart, who are a big part of our currency. We continue to build out the currency capability and we will launch as soon as they are ready to launch in the Wal-Mart and Samsung organization and some of our other partners as soon as they are ready.","So, I think, they are working through some of the functionality and doing some more testing. So, I think, in the near-term you will hear something of that being out in marketplace.","Jamie Friedman","Great. Appreciate the update.","Operator","And thank you, our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Question on the CareCredit platform, some competitors, some marketplace lenders have been suggesting that they're interested in competing in that space and I just want to get take the opportunity to understand how you feel your penetration has been going, how your progress has been against goals you set out and whether or not you\u2019ve seen any incremental competition coming from these new lenders or not?","Margaret Keane","Yeah. I will start-off with, we have an incredible platform with CareCredit and we have enormous penetration in the industry that we are in. So, I think, when you start with that, one of the things that I think is unique in CareCredit, unless you see the dental space as an example. It\u2019s not like you can go on sign-up the Wal-Mart and get a whole bunch of volume, you literally have to go dental office to dental office to dental office across the United States.","So to gain traction and build-out that platform from a start-up is extraordinary hard. So we are not really seeing that competition really have any impact on us at this point. Many of the competitors also are doing more of an installment type lending versus revolving lending, and I think one of the unique things that we\u2019ve really been able to build out. First of all, we have incredible brand-name.","Our brand, we do market testing is, we see extraordinary rollout of customers who use that products. We are getting 50% of our transactions now repeat purchases. So I went into like that and I use it in the dental office or things like that.","I think our example today of partnering with Rite Aid, where we are really looking at how do we increase the utility of the card, because the customers who have that card have a great affinity to it.","So we are not really seeing these guys. I know they are out there. We obviously we keep an eye on all our competition, but I think given our experience in the space, we have this business for 25 years, we are now there for 25 years. So I think, we are well ahead of those guys and I think it will take a little time for them even really have any type of kind of impact on us if they even do.","Betsy Graseck","Okay.","Brian Doubles","And I think, Betsy, you can look at is the purchase volume trends have also been pretty strong year-to-date. In the first quarter purchase volume was 5.6%, second quarter was 8.5%, this quarter was 12.5%, so we are very encouraged by the trend we are seeing around purchase volume as well.","Betsy Graseck","Right. I mean, it\u2019s a little bit more expensive channel to run than the other two platforms, is that accurate statement?","Margaret Keane","Well, I think, you need infrastructure behind both these platform and payment solution\u2026","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Margaret Keane","\u2026 because you are dealing with thousands of merchants and you need a merchant process behind same in sourcing to work in the right way. So it\u2019s a bigger build-out I would say, and we have been out this for really long-time.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Margaret Keane","So, I think, we have certainly have scale in that.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. And then just second thing, one of your major retail partners Wal-Mart obviously this week had an Analyst Day with highlight a little bit of lower expectation for spend trajectory, and I wonder if you could comment about that and impact on your business?","Margaret Keane","Sure. So, obviously, we saw the same thing. What I would say to you is that, traditionally and we\u2019ve shown trust and earnest. We outperformed the retailer two to three times from an organic growth perspective on our card programs we are always doing better than the retailer. And I would say that our program both with Samsung, Wal-Mart are very strong. We are doing really well.","I\u2019d also say to you that this is an always -- when retailers go through challenging times and we\u2019ve been in this business eight years. For sure, we\u2019ve seen people win and lose at different points. This is where our partnership becomes even that more value and this is where I think our unique business model makes a difference. So this is where you have to stick by a partner and our goal is to figure out ways that we can help Wal-Mart even further.","So they usually becomes more of an engagement on how cards or how card could help them grow their sales. So, we are watching it, we are not worried. Our performance is very strong. They are great partners. We have great relation. We have 80 people sitting out in that though who all they think about every single day is Wal-Mart and Samsung and that\u2019s their job. Their job is to figure out how to grow sales for our partner and that\u2019s the model that\u2019s tries who we are. So, we feel okay. I think they got a bump road but we will be with them all the way and I think we will help them as they go through that process.","Betsy Graseck","Thanks.","Greg Ketron","All right, Vanessa. We have time for one more question.","Operator","And thank you, our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Most of my questions have been asked. I thought I would just ask one about the penetration rates. You highlight ongoing organic growth is the primary source of growth. It appears that that\u2019s really the result of improving penetration of your partners. Are you seeing any changes in the case of penetration, or should we just assume some consistency there?","Margaret Keane","Well, it varies by partners. So, we have partners where we have very high penetration and then partners we have single-digit penetration. I think the way to think about it is, there are couple of different areas where I think our marketing and the way we are approaching the market is really just helping ourselves. We talked about this repeat purchase concept and CareCredit and Payment Solutions. So, we are doing a lot more marketing in those two platforms around getting customers to use the card again.","And that\u2019s a good example because if you went into this business four years ago, five years ago, with a bigger ticket purchase we thought of it as a one-end done. You bought whatever you bought and that was it. And our ability to really get customers to reuse the card, I think is a really big factor and those two platforms. I think on the Retail Card platform, I think probably one of the things that\u2019s really helping us besides the great value prospect we\u2019ve put out there, the [Sam's envelopes] [ph] and Amazon, the once we talked about. Mobiles and online is definitely helping us. We are outpacing the industry.","So the industry for online sales year-over-year is about 14%. We\u2019re growing at 21% year-over-year and I think that\u2019s having an impact. And we know for fact through our research is the customer shops both brick-and-mortar and online and mobile that we have a tighter relationship with that customer and they will make more shopping trip and they will have bigger baskets.","So I think the more we can connect those dots in making that brick-and-mortar and online digital experience seamless to the consumer, I think we have an opportunity to continue to grow penetration.","John Hecht","Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks. And second question is just thinking of your new program ramps, I mean, what\u2019s that -- your BP, Guitar Center, I guess, Citgo, are those fully -- are those in the ramp stage or they kind of fully -- or they have normal run rates at this point in time to help us think about how those might improve in near term?","Brian Doubles","BP is obviously in the run rate as of the second quarter and that\u2019s lifting our growth rate. We saw that in the second quarter and the third quarter. The other two are in -- sorry, Guitar Center is in thick of knot end. So you will see a little bit of a ramp there but just I can\u2019t give you the actual size of either one of them but they are smaller in relation to BP. So you just kind of take that into account.","John Hecht","Great. Thanks very much.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Greg Ketron","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have and have a great day.","Operator","And thank you ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference call.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. I will begin on Slide 3.","The overall fundamentals of the business remained strong in the second quarter, with net earnings of $541 million or $0.65 per share. We drove strong growth again this quarter with purchase volume up 11%, loan receivables growth of 12% and platform revenue growth of 9%.","We continue to see the impact of offering compelling value proposition, including our Sam's Club 531 cash back credit card program and the Amazon 5% reward program, wherein Amazon prime customers receive 5% back every day on their Amazon store card purchases.","In addition, we rolled out an attractive new value proposition through a Driver Rewards and loyalty program with BP, a new partner which we have on-boarded this quarter and we also announced a new rewards program through our extension with Chevron.","Asset quality improved with a 25-basis point decline in the net charge-offs rate and a 29-basis point improvement in delinquencies. Expenses were in line with our expectations, impacted by investments we made to support growth and the build out of our standalone infrastructure.","Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 17.2% and liquidity of $14 billion at quarter end. We continue to generate solid deposit growth, with deposit increasing $7 billion or 24% over the second quarter of last year to $38 billion.","Deposits now comprise 61% of our funding sources within the lower range of our targeted 60% to 70%. Our ongoing efforts to grow deposits and provide increase in value to our depositors, with new features and enhancements are yielding results.","To improve the online experience for our customers, we recently redesigned our online banking platform, building a new technology such as a responsive web design, so that customers can have the same user experience regardless of which device they use.","Popular feature such as mobile check deposit, customized email alerts and account balance snapshots are seamlessly integrated into the site. We have also streamlined access to our perks, loyalty and rewards program and completely redesigned our online account opening experience, demonstrating our commitment to bringing value and a great experience to our banking customers.","During the quarter, we signed new partners across each of our platforms, extending key existing contracts and made technology investments, which are yielding innovative value-added services for our customers and partners. In fact, we were recently recognized by InformationWeek for our innovative mobile solutions across the entire credit lifecycle, ranking 48 on this year's InformationWeek Elite 100, a list of the top business technology innovators in the U.S.","We were also recognized by CIO Magazine as part of their 2015 CIO 100 award program, which recognizes organizations worldwide that exemplify operational and strategic excellence in IT.","We announced several new partners; among the biggest were Mattress Firm, the largest seller of bedding in the U.S., Newegg, a leading tech-focused e-tailer and Stash Hotel Rewards, an award-winning loyalty program for independent hotels in the U.S. and Caribbean.","As I noted, we extended our partnership with Chevron, one of our 20 largest partners. With that, we now have nearly 88% of retail card receivables under contract to 2019 and beyond. Additionally, we renewed a CareCredit endorsement with the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.","We are excited about these new partnerships and our ability to bring significant value to these relationships. At the same time, we still have a meaningful opportunity to drive organic growth and we continue to pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepen penetration across our partnerships.","The online and mobile channels are increasingly important channels for our business. As customer shopping behaviors have migrated to digital, the importance of credit has followed suit.","Our digital strategies have helped drive a marked increase in online and mobile purchase volume, which is up 20% from last year and nearly a third of our credit applications are now done through digital channels.","We have been working hard to ensure that the key benefits cardholders enjoy and the data our partners need are retained when transactions move to mobile devices. The big question with enabling private-label credit cards and Apple Pay has been around whether the capture of valuable transaction data would still occur.","I am pleased to report that we have implemented a solution that will provide us and our retailers, access to the same level of data on transactions that go through Apple Pay.","Another key point is that we have developed a mobile platform that can rapidly integrate across retailers and wallets, which will allow us to offer our unique value proposition to Apple Pay users. Benefits such as loyalty and rewards programs and point of sale discounts will be retained for our cardholders.","We were excited to announce this quarter that we will be among the first issuers to offer private label cardholders the ability to add their cards to Apple Pay, and JCPenney will be the first of our partners to offer its private label cardholders the ability to make purchases with Apple Pay.","We are also finalizing preparations to enable our private label and Dual Cards in the currency wallet and anticipate the launch to occur later this year and we are in active discussions regarding the integration of our private label and Dual Cards with Android Pay.","We are pleased with the progress we have made on mobile wallets. The speed at which we have been able to adapt to ensure our cardholders can use our cards and their wallet of choice while maintaining the benefits for both cardholders and our partners speaks to our commitment to being at the forefront of this evolving landscape.","Lastly, regarding our separation from GE, progress continued in the second quarter and we filed our application to separate on April 30th. The Fed has assigned a dedicated team to us and they have initiated their fieldwork, which we expect will continue through the summer.","After they wrap this up, we expect that their findings will be submitted to the Board of Governors for a review and decision. We believe that obtaining approvals to separate will be focused on our financial strength and the infrastructure we have built to be a standalone business.","Slide 4 highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remained strong at 12%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 11%, and average active account growth of 4%. Additionally, the close of the BP acquisition contributed to the growth.","Platform revenue was up 9% over the second quarter of last year. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continue to drive incremental growth through strong value propositions and promotional financing offers.","On the next slide, I will discuss the performance within each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to review the financial results in more detail.","We continue to drive strong performance across all three of our platforms in the second quarter. Through our retail card platform, we offer private label credit cards and our proprietary Dual Cards as well as small business products. The addition of BP, which closed this quarter, brings us to 20 retail card partners nationwide.","Our retail card platform accounts for 69% of our receivables in platform revenue. Retail card performance was exceptionally strong this quarter, with purchase volume growth of 12%, receivables growth of 14% and our platform revenue growth of 10%.","We had strong receivables growth across our partner programs and the addition of BP contributed. However, the majority of our growth continues to be organically-driven. In addition to adding new partners that are a good strategic fit, renewing and extending our programs is a key priority in this business.","During the quarter, we extended another one of our top-20 largest partners with the renewal of the Chevron contract, and now nearly 88% of our retail card receivables are under contract through 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the engaged partnerships we have developed, provide a solid foundation for future growth.","Payment Solutions, which accounts for 20% of our receivables and 15% of our platform revenue is the leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases, primarily in the home furnishing, consumer electronics, jewelry, automotive and power product markets.","This platform also delivered another quarter of strong performance with purchase volume and average active accounts, each up 8% over the same quarter last year. This drove receivables growth of 11% and platform revenue growth of 7%.","The majority of our industries had positive growth in both, purchase volume and receivables, including home furnishing, automotive products and power equipment. Both, acquisition and renewals are also important in this business. We have had a lot of success in these fronts with the announcement of new partnerships such as Mattress Firm and Newegg, as well as a number of program extensions.","CareCredit, which accounts for about 11% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue, is a leading provider of financing to consumers for elective healthcare procedures that include dental, veterinary, cosmetic, and vision and audiology services. Our partners in this platform are largely individual and small groups of independent healthcare providers. The remainders are national and regional healthcare providers.","Purchase volume was up 9% and average active accounts increased 6%, helping to drive receivables growth of 5% and platform revenue growth of 8% over the same quarter of last year. Receivables growth this quarter was led by our dental and veterinary specialties.","In addition to the important endorsement, we renewed with American Society of Plastic Surgeons, we also announced a new CareCredit partnership with Vets First Choice. With this program, CareCredit cardholders will be able to use their cards to pay for online purchases of pet medicines and diet food products at more than 10,000 veterinary practice websites nationwide.","Each platform delivered solid results and continue to make progress in the signing of new partnerships and the extension of existing programs while driving organic growth.","I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter.","Brian Doubles","Thanks Margaret. I will start on Slide 6 of the presentation.","In the second quarter, the business earned $541 million of net income, which translates to $0.65 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter, with purchase up 11%, platform revenue up 9% and receivables up 12%.","Overall, we are pleased with the growth we are seeing across the business. We saw increases in both, purchase volume per active account as well as our average balance per account. These are both good indicator that our value propositions are resonating with consumers and they continue to see real benefits when they use our cards.","We also closed the BP portfolio acquisition in the quarter, which was a little ahead of schedule. Net interest income was up 7% in the quarter. This includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was issued to increase liquidity in the third quarter last year.","Interest income was up 9%, which is in line with our average receivables growth. RSAs things were up $31 million or 5% compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.1% for the quarter, which was fairly consistent with the second quarter last year.","Going forward, we would expect RSAs as a percentage of receivables to move back in the 4.5% range for the balance of the year. We typically see RSAs as a percentage of average receivables trend higher in the third quarter as seasonally lower charge-offs lead to a higher RSA level.","The provision increased $59 million or 9% compared to last year. The increase was driven primarily by receivables growth. The key asset quality metrics improved compared to last year, 30-plus delinquencies improved 29 basis points versus last year to 3.53% and the net charge-offs rate fell to 4.63%, which is 25 basis points below last year.","Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was down 10 basis points compared to the second quarter last year to 5.38%. Measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs, the reserve coverage was 1.27 times. Overall, our reserve coverage metrics were fairly stable.","Other income increased $8 million or 7% versus last year, driven by strong growth in interchange revenue and a pretax gain of $20 million from two portfolio sales. This was partially offset by higher loyalty and rewards costs associated with program initiatives.","Interchange was up $31 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card. This was offset by loyalty expense that was up $31 million, primarily driven by the new value propositions. As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through our RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items.","Debt cancellation fees of $61 million were down $9 million from last year; due to the fact that only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased $8 million versus the second quarter of last quarter, primarily driven by growth in the infrastructure build, partially offset by a consumer remediation expense last year.","We continue to make investments to support ongoing growth across all platforms and also had expenses related to the launch of the BP program, the EVM rollout, higher marketing in our programs and technology to support our mobile wallet strategy.","The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 33.5%, which is in line with our annual guidance of below 34%. I will cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, we had a solid quarter with strong top-line growth generating an ROA of 2.9%.","I will move to Slide 7, and walk you through our net interest income and margin trends. As I noted on the prior slide, net interest income growth was strong at 7%, interest and fees on loan receivables was up 8%, partially offset by higher funding costs related to the additional liquidity we are caring on the balance sheet compared to last year.","The net interest margin declined to 15.77%, which was slightly better than our expectations. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, 207 basis points was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio.","We increased liquidity on the balance sheet to nearly $14 billion, which is up $7.5 billion versus last year. We have the cash conservatively invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the fed, which results in a lower yield than the rest of our earning assets.","The yield on our receivables was relatively stable, down three basis points compared to last year. This was a result of slightly higher payment rates in the quarter compared to last year. Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.8%, up 20 basis points compared to last year. This was in line with our expectations given the changes in our funding profile. I will walk you through a breakdown by funding source.","First, the cost of our deposits was relatively stable, up 10 basis points to 1.6%. The increase was driven by extending the average tenor [ph] of our direct retail CDs, partially offset by growth in our lower rate savings account product.","Our deposit base increased $7 billion or 24% year-over-year. We are pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform. Deposits are now 61% of our funding, which is in line with the target we set of between 60% and 70%.","Securitization funding cost increased five basis points to 1.5%. This was driven by extending some maturities in our Master Note Trust and the addition of $500 million of undrawn securitization capacity. Our other debt costs increased 68 basis points to 2.8%, due to the higher rates on the bank term loan facility as well as the unsecured bonds.","While the second quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this was primarily driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the bank term loans. Looking ahead, we continue to expect that our margin will move back in the 15% to 15.5% range in the second half of the year.","Next, I will cover our key credit trends on Slide 8.","As I noted earlier, we continued to see stable to improving trends on asset quality, 30-plus delinquencies were 3.53%, down 29 basis points versus last year. 90-plus delinquencies were 1.52%, down 13 basis points. We believe these improvements are driven at least in part by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer given the continued improvement in employment trends.","Our net charge-offs rate also improve to 4.63%, down 25 basis points versus last year. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.38%, which was down 10 basis points from the prior year. If you measure the reserve coverage against the last 12 months' charge-offs, we are currently at 1.27 times coverage, which equates to roughly 15 months lost coverage in our reserve.","Overall, we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trends that we are seeing. Given those factors, we believe that our credit trends will continue to be stable for the balance of the year.","Moving to Slide 9, I will cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses were in line with our expectations. While reported expenses increased 1% versus last year, as I noted earlier, we did have a $42 million consumer remediation expense in the second quarter of last year.","Adjusting for this, expenses grew 7%, which is more in line with our receivables growth, but also included expenses associated with the infrastructure build as we prepare for separation from GE, as well as startup cost to launch the BP program and our EMV rollout.","More specifically, the largest driver of the increase in expenses were employee costs, which were up $43 million as we added employees over the past year in key areas to support the infrastructure build for separation as well as growth of the business.","Professional fees were up $11 million due to both, separation related costs and growth. Marketing and business development costs were up $11 million as we continue to invest in our partners' program growth as well as marketing associated with our direct deposit products.","Information processing was up $21 million, driven by higher IT investment and transaction volumes compared to last year.","Other decreased $78 million versus prior year, primarily driven by the consumer remediation item I mentioned earlier as well as the GE cost allocations last year that were replaced by expenses in other categories","The costs associated with the infrastructure build are now largely reflected in our run rate. While we will have incremental expense in the second half of the year related to growth in the EMV rollout, as well as investment in our digital capabilities, we expect our efficiency ratio will be in line with our annual guidance of below 34% for the year.","Moving to Slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the growth of our deposit base. We view this as a stable and attractive source of funding for the business.","Over the last year, we have grown our deposits by $7 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 61% of our funding, which is in line with our target of being 60% to 70% deposit funded.","While we have now moved within our target range, we expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. We are also looking at additional ways to increase the stickiness of this deposit base, including the rollout of new products later next year such as checking and bill pay capabilities.","Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $14 billion the $15 billion range, which is approximately 23% of our funding. As we have said in the past, our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility as this is a more expensive source of funding for the business.","We have continued to pay this down during the quarter making a $500 million prepayment on May 5th. Since the IPO, we have paid down the bank term loan facility from $8.2 billion last year to $5.2 billion today. We also completely paid off the $1.5 billion GE Capital loan last quarter.","Overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources; we will continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility.","Turning to capital, we ended the quarter at 17.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules and 16.4% CET1 under the fully phased in Basel III rules.","Consistent with prior communications, we do not plan to return capital through dividends or buybacks until we complete the separation from GE, so we do expect our capital levels will continue to increase during that time. Post separation, we would expect to begin returning capital in line with our peers.","Moving to liquidity, total liquidity increased to $19.8 billion and is comprised of $13.7 billion in cash and short-term treasuries and an additional $6.1 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 26% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.","Overall, we are executing on the strategy that we outlined previously, we have built a very strong balance sheet with diversify funding sources and strong capital liquidity levels.","With that, I will turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks Brian. I will close with the summary of the quarter on Slide 11, and then we will begin the Q&A portion of the call.","During the quarter, we exhibited strong growth across several key areas, making progress on several fronts and continuing the momentum we have generated over the last several quarters. We continue to make our products valuable to our retail partners, merchants, providers and consumers by enhancing our capabilities, developing compelling value propositions and creating innovative technologies such as our digital wallet capabilities. We are happy to see our digital wallet strategy take hold, we will be one of the first issuers to offer private-label credit cards and Apple Pay, and we recently launched our BP Dual Card in this digital wallet.","We continue to win and renew important partnership and maintain a healthy pipeline of additional opportunities and we are pleased with the ongoing success of our fast-growing deposit platform. With the application now filed, we look forward to providing you updates as we continue to move closer to our separation from GE.","I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator, we are now ready to begin the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We have our first question from Mark DeVries with Barclays. Please go ahead.","Mark DeVries","Yes. Thank you. First question, I am interested to get any updated thoughts you may have on whether you will be included in the CCAR process following the separation from GE.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure Mark. This is Brian. We are not technically subject to CCAR just given our charter. We are a savings and loan holding company, not a bank holding company, so we are not technically subject to CCAR.","With that said, we are certainly preparing is therefore going to be subject to the same oversight by the Fed, the same processes, so when the CCAR scenarios come out, we run those scenarios, we are developing our models in such a way that we believe they are CCAR compliant and meet the regulators' expectations.","That is how we think about, governance of our capital, so we are building those processes, but it is unclear as of right now as to whether or not we will be formally subject to CCAR. Obviously, that is part of the application and the approval to separate. The Fed can subject us to CCAR or something that looks a lot like it, so that is how we are preparing.","Mark DeVries","Okay, but no communication yet from them on whether they seem inclined to do that?","Brian Doubles","Well, we can't comment specifically on our discussions with our regulators, but I think what is important here is, we are preparing is therefore going to be regulated just like other banks of similar size. You know you should assume that whether it is through CCAR or another means that the Fed is going to regulate our capital levels in a similar way.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Fair enough. Then for Margaret, do you have any sense for when Amazon may start to more aggressively market the new 5% cash back rewards for prime customers? I got to tell you I am an active prime customer and I had to find out about the offer through Greg, so they are clearly not doing a great job of getting it out there.","Margaret Keane","He is our great marketing guy. Isn't he? Yes. We rolled this out a couple of weeks ago and I think with any new offer, we really want to make sure that the offer is working. Obviously, the prime customer is an incredibly important customer to Amazon, so working jointly together with them, we wanted, one, to make sure the offer was working, two, that all of our processes and Amazon's processes were working really well to really give the best experience to the customer, so I would stay tuned. The plan is for this to be a big part of what Amazon is looking to do in the future. Obviously, as we said it is a great offer, so we are pretty excited about the potential.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Good morning, guys. Thanks very much. One question, I think you said, you purchased the BP portfolio in the quarter. Can you tell us what the dollar amount of that was? In addition to that, when should we see the impact of the new partnerships in the BP coming into the receivables volume?","Brian Doubles","Sure John. We acquired BP towards the end of May, so it is in the EOP, but you do not have a full quarter's worth of purchase volume. I can't give you the exact size of BP. I can't disclose it, but I can tell you that our entire oil and gas portfolios are less than 3% of our receivables, so that will give you kind of an upper bound. That includes BP, Chevron, P66.","John Hecht","Okay. Great. Then I wonder if you guys can give us maybe an update of the prioritization of your deployment of excess capital once the split-off is complete and you either go through a CCAR-like process or at least work with the regulators to determine appropriate capital levels.","Brian Doubles","Sure. The prioritization has not changed. Organic growth is first and foremost the top priority along with portfolio acquisitions. We think that we have got a robust pipeline in all three of our platforms. We will continue to look to bring on new relationships. We brought on the BP portfolio, we just talked about we announced MattressFirm, which we think will be a great deal for us. That is going to launch in April of our 2016, so we will continue to compete and try and grow the business organically, so that is first priority.","Second priority would be to establish a regular dividend and share repurchase program. Then I would say lastly, we will look at M&A. We are always looking at M&A opportunities. I will tell you, we will be a lot more disciplined around M&A compared to the other three alternatives as a use for capital just given the risk profile.","I think if you see us do something on the M&A front, it will most likely be a very close adjacency to what we do today, so it will be something that will help us build out our capabilities, help our partners drive incremental sales in the programs, so that type of acquisition opportunity.","John Hecht","Great, appreciate the color. Thanks guys.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much. Just a couple of follow ups related to separation. In terms of the costs, I know at the end of the first quarter, there was about an incremental $40 million of annualized costs still to come. Did that fully make it into the second quarter run rate or is there still an incremental portion in the back half?","Brian Doubles","Yes. I did make it into the second quarter, so you should assume that the second quarter reflects kind of the end of that infrastructure build cost, so that is in the run rate of the second quarter.","As you think about the second half as I mentioned earlier, we are going to have - there will be some incremental cost in the second half, but not tied to the infrastructure build. We are going to complete the rollout of EMV.","You typically see marketing expense increase in the second half of year, so we would expect to see that again this year, so you are going to have those types of things that happen in the second half of the year, but I would not expect anything material incremental on the infrastructure built.","Eric Wasserstrom","Has anything changed in your view about the $470 million sort of sustainable incremental post-separation cost?","Brian Doubles","Yes. If we look at what is in the second quarter run rate, we came in very close to that estimate that we provided last year.","Eric Wasserstrom","To the extent that the timing of the approval comes later than the year end, does that have any meaningful implication for your cost base?","Brian Doubles","No. It does not.","Eric Wasserstrom","Okay. Great. Thanks very much.","Brian Doubles","Yup.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Don Fandetti with Citi.","Don Fandetti","Yes, Brian. A couple questions on interest rate sensitivity. It is my understanding that your estimates for rate sensitivity do not include any pass-through of higher funding cost to the retail. Can you talk a little bit about your ability to push some of that through specifically in your retail partnership business?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure. Don, you are right. The shock scenarios that we publish, and there hasn't really been a change to those. We are still mildly asset-sensitive, so 100 basis points shock interest rates takes our net interest income up about $75 million, which is less than 1%, so that profile has remained relatively consistent.","We do have the opportunity in some of our agreements to pass-through higher funding cost. I will tell you that each one of these agreements is different, so I cannot give you a rule of thumb, because every deal works a little bit differently, but generally you should think about the deals working similarly and the fact that we calculate an after-tax return, funding cost is typically a component of that as well as credit costs and revenue and all the other P&L line items. We earn up to a hurdle and we share above that hurdle, so that dynamic holds true for the most part on interest expense, but every deal does work a little bit differently.","Don Fandetti","Okay. Then secondly, can you talk about loan growth expectations, I may have missed it, but I did not hear guidance discussion.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Obviously, we had a very strong quarter. I think, we are performing ahead of where we thought would be back in January, so we are very happy with the growth that we are seeing so far.","I think the results are particularly good considering retail sales overall were somewhat sluggish. Retail sales in the second quarter were up 1.7% year-over-year and our purchase volume was up 11, so we are very encouraged by what we are seeing so far this year.","In terms of the remainder of the year, you got a couple of big factors that you have to take into account. We have got back-to-school. That will give us a good indication on how consumers are spending.","We have obviously got the holiday season that will largely determine where we end up for the year, but generally the growth trends are all moving in the right direction. We look at purchased volume. Proactive account was up 6%. We saw an increase in average balance per account as well, so those are both good indicator that consumers are seeing real value on our cards.","You know Margaret mentioned that online sales were up 20%. The other thing that we should just highlight, we have talked about in prior calls the reuse that we are seeing in both CareCredit and Payment Solutions. CareCredit reuse was at 50% for the quarter that is up from 47% a year ago and payment solutions reuse was 27%. That is up from 26%.","You know breakdown the quarter and look at the growth trends, they are all moving in the right direction and we are really pleased with where we are for the first half of the year.","Don Fandetti","Got you. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning, Betsy.","Betsy Graseck","We have talked in the past quite a bit about mobile and I know you are doing a lot on mobile for the card and the reward programs that you have. I am just wondering are you also thinking about developing mobile products for the deposits business, your overall banking business as well?","Margaret Keane","Yes. Actually in my opening comments I mentioned we have a new mobile platform, so we just rolled that out, so we took the learnings and capability we have on our card side and rolled it over to the mobile platform for our deposit customer and that is going extraordinary well, so the ability to open an account on a mobile phone is much better than it was and we have added a whole bunch of features on the mobile phone and we will continue to build that out as we add additional products.","Betsy Graseck","Clearly your cardholders could also be managing their payments through deposits they have with you.","Margaret Keane","Most of what they have with us is CDs and savings product. I think, as we move to adding checking accounts later next year that will be a definite positive there.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. Then just one kind of ticky-tacky question on credit trends, I think you mentioned, Brian, that you expect credit trends to continue to be stable for the balance of the year. I guess I just wanted to make sure I understood, are you talking about ratios or dollars?","Brian Doubles","More ratios, you know, credit is going to grow in line with growth in receivables, but we would expect the ratios to hold pretty consistent. We have said that all year. I think in the first and second quarter credit in a little better than we expected, we think, primarily driven by lower gas prices.","Betsy Graseck","Right.","Brian Doubles","It is just a little unclear how much of that is going to continue, but I think everything we look at still feels like credit will be stable.","Betsy Graseck","Right, so NCO ratios stable and provisions moving up with balances as you do the reserve build associated with the balance growth?","Brian Doubles","That is exactly right. We would expect to continue to build reserves for the new receivable growth.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Good morning, Margaret. Good morning, Brian.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning, Ryan.","Ryan Nash","Maybe a question on a comment you made, Margaret, about a healthy pipeline for additional opportunities for business wins. When I look back historically, I think somewhere around 200 to 300 basis points of loan growth has been added via portfolio purchases, can you just talk about your appetite for further portfolio acquisitions at this point for maybe the next 6 months to 12 months?","Given that you have added a couple of start-up programs over the past couple of quarters, how much capacity is there to add more of those?","Margaret Keane","The first thing I would say is, we have an opportunity to continue to grow organically, so I would start out by saying we can really be selective about what we go after. You know, our appetite to grow with new acquisitions whether it is an existing portfolio or a start-up is very strong.","We reorganized our development team well over a year ago. We now have very dedicated resources in all three platforms, so we have a very healthy pipeline that we are looking at and it is really great to have a mix between existing portfolio and start-ups.","Some of our biggest programs today were start-ups, so we are very bullish on start-ups. We know how to do them. Obviously it takes a little bit of time to get them to grow out of the gate, but once you get that engine going it really takes off, so we are very focused on both, driving the organic side, but more importantly, winning new opportunities in the market.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Then if I could just ask a follow-up on, related to split up on a comment that you made. I think you mentioned, Margaret, that there is an on-site team and they were going to submit something to the Board.","Can you just help us understand, you know, the process from here? What should we be looking for in terms of milestones? Obviously, they are going to make their presentation and then how should we think about the timing of that?","Is it a back and forth dialogue? If you were to think about areas where you could potentially have concern that could cause us to delay into 2016, what would some of those concerns be?","Margaret Keane","Yes. Overall, I would say, the team is on the ground. I can't really comment on the specifics, but I would say it has been a very good process. I think, you all know that we had done a pre-application well over a year ago and got very good guidance through a pre-application process of things we had to focus on.","Obviously, we would not have filed the application if we did not think we were ready. Brian already mentioned that the cost of the infrastructure is already in our second quarter, so we feel that the things that we needed to focus on, corporate governance, risk management, our whole capital planning process, you know, model developing government and you know, IT infrastructure, which was a big one, are in place.","They are in here, they will work through the summer. The question then becomes how quickly can a write-up their recommendation. Then it goes to the Board of Governors, which it is a little open to how that process is going to work, whether they do it in an existing meeting or they have a separate meeting, but our view right now is we are still targeting the end of the year.","I think if it does slip into the first quarter, it really is just around the ability of the fed to get through everything that they have, the application is fairly significant, and getting this in front of the Board of Governors in the right timeframe, and I will have Brian comment a little bit about the timing at the end of the year, because we have certain windows, we have to do this within.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Our expectation, Ryan, would be that we receive the approval that will be public. Very shortly thereafter, we would launch the exchange offer. We do have to manage around earnings blackout period for us and for GE, so there are specific windows that we can target for the exchange offer.","It has got to be open 20 days. It could be extended another 10 days, so those are the things that we are managing as we look at when exactly we could get this completed.","Ryan Nash","Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Good morning. Just circling back on the loan growth from Dual Card, I know it is about 20% to 25% of your receivable balances. How quickly is that growing relative to the non- Dual Card portion of your portfolio?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Dual Card growth, we do not break it out specifically, but it is growing and it will always grow faster than private-label credit cards. Let me just spend a minute and explain the dynamics there.","We have, what we call, loan growth strategy. We start new accounts out with a smaller PLCC line. We increase that line over time as they demonstrate payment behavior and we get more comfortable with the credit worthiness of that consumer.","Then ultimately, we upgrade them into a Dual Card account, so just that dynamic of the upgrade from a PLCC to a Dual Card, will give you higher growth rate, faster growth rate in Dual Card than what we see in PLCC.","I cannot tell you that the Dual Card growth rates have been relatively consistent more or less in line with our expectations. I think, right now we have Dual Card programs in 14 of our 20 relationships, so there are still an opportunity I think to launch some Dual Card programs in the rest of the portfolio.","David Ho","Okay. Given that the Sam's Club 531 card has very attractive, kind of similar value prop versus the Costco card. Do you expect any benefits from any kind of ongoing Costco card uncertainty as that potentially plays out and make it delayed? Are you baking in any kind of attrition into your core card op [ph] there?","Brian Doubles","We are not baking anything in for that. I think, The Sam's Club value props stands on its own, it is a very attractive value prop, 531 and we have been very pleased with the results so far since we launched it.","David Ho","Okay. Then separately on the deposit beta is obviously a lot of discussion this quarter across from your banking peers. It seems like you guys should be running closer to one versus some of your peers. Do you still think you could run near 75 or what kind of gets you confident that you could see and deposit betas will maybe a little lower than kind of what you are running at now?","Brian Doubles","Well, I think there are a couple things. There is not a lot of history here, so I do not think anybody knows as rates start to rise what deposit betas are going to look like. The landscapes are a lot different than the last. The only time period you can really look at is 2004 to 2007 and deposit betas for online platforms were between 60 and 70.","Are they going to be higher this time around? They could be. I think as we look at it, first, we do not have any significant investment, no investment tied up in brick-and-mortar branches. I think that helps us offset the impact if deposit betas come in higher.","We have obviously got pretty healthy margins, so I think if deposit betas come in on a high-end or a little bit higher, that is still fairly manageable for us, so time will tell where this thing plays out.","The other thing that we are doing, we have talked about this I think in prior calls. Right now, we are competing to some extent on rate and I think customer service. To the extent that we can rollout some of these new capabilities, Margaret mentioned, demand checking accounts, online bill pay, that will help us lower the deposit beta over time and that is absolutely in the plans and we are looking at rolling those out next year.","David Ho","Okay. None of that is baked into you are kind of published asset sensitivity scenarios?","Brian Doubles","No. It is not.","David Ho","Okay. Great. Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. Most of my question actually have been asked and answered, but I actually was kind of intrigued that you had both, loan growth that was better than your spending volume growth and I guess a little bit of that was the acquisition of the portfolio, but still better and stable yield year-on-year.","Could you talk a little bit about that? I would have thought that it is just a natural decay because of the stuff you talked about with respect to the way that portfolio has evolved?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Again, I would attribute a big chunk of that to BP, in fact that we only had a month worth of purchase volume, but we had obviously brought on all the receivables at the end of the quarter. I think that is part of the biggest driver to think about. Other than that, I do not know that there are any other underlying trends to highlight.","Moshe Orenbuch","With respect to just the yield on the portfolio, I mean, I would assume that like Dual Cards and other things like that probably have lower yields than some of your pure retail programs or some of the CareCredit things, right?","Brian Doubles","Yes. Typically in a Dual Card product, you get back to the net return, but you get there differently. If I just compare a private-label return to a Dual Card return, Dual Card tends to be higher FICO customer, so you will see less revolve on your accounts, you see lower financed charges, but that is largely offset by lower losses. When you kind of net those to how you get back to a similar return that we earn on PLCC. Again, on Dual Card, obviously, you are earning on a higher balance, so you are getting incremental earnings.","Moshe Orenbuch","Sure. Then just separately, you had addressed this partway to Ryan's question before about portfolio acquisitions. Maybe just talk a little bit about what you see out there. You said almost 90% of your business is contracted for the next four years, but what is out there in terms of portfolios that could be available over the next year or two?","Margaret Keane","There is a plenty of portfolios. First of all the way we look at this is, just things coming up for us is always a natural set of portfolio that come up. I would not say Moshe, there is anything big out there.","Moshe Orenbuch","Right.","Margaret Keane","I think the big portfolios, there is not a lot of over $1 billion portfolios out there, but there is plenty in the $250 million up to $1 billion that I think we are looking at and going after. I think the other is just looking at the start-ups.","I mean, it is interesting to note that a number of retails still do not have a program and believe it or not we are seeing more activity of people actually reaching out to us enquiring about doing a portfolio, so there has been a little more activity there. I think some of that is driven by the fact that as retail sales struggle a bit, having a program certainly helps and we have proven that by the programs that we do have.","Then there is the whole online space and things that are happening there. From an activity perspective, we are actually going after all of those things and I would say that we are fine with, and you know that is going for smaller deal to a bigger deal, so I think it gives us an opportunity to look more broadly.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks so much.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Thanks, guys, for taking my question. When we look back, I think it is easy to explain the post-crisis growth as a function of Synchrony was in the market providing capital when in general the supply was decreasing and we are now in an environment that is intensely competitive, supply has increased, we are seeing peers and one of the things we have noted is line limit increases, so a lot of the consumers with general purpose cards had sort of been unshackled, but you guys are still really generating strong organic growth.","Brian, you talked about this a little bit, but what do you guys really think is driving this. Are we seeing a behavioral shift between general purpose and private label?","Margaret Keane","Well, I think, I would attribute it to really two things. One, I think, we are seeing this in terms of consumer behavior. The consumers are still being conservative about how they expand.","I think the value propositions on our cards, in fact that we have I think got a good machine running around how we are putting out the next software, how we are using data and analytics, when you talk about or what Brian mentioned earlier about the re use of our cards and Payments Solution and CareCredit, those are things that we have really put in place over the last couple of years.","I would say the other big win for us is really our whole digital strategy. If Brian mentioned this or I mentioned this in my opening, our online sales were up 20% year-over-year. If you look at the overall industry, U.S. sales are growing at 14%, so we are getting a big greater share of those online sales.","Our mobile applications are really growing. About a third of our applications now come through mobile. Then 42% of our active customers are actually interacting with us some way using our digital channels, so I think as the consumer behavior shifts to mobile. I think one big advantage that we have versus many other general purpose credit cards is you can apply and buy immediately and you could do it on your mobile phone.","I think our ability to capture that customer at the sites of purchase I think is really a big, big opportunity for us, and one that as we continue to build out our data and analytics team to really drive that and I think I mentioned in the past, we have partnered with GPShopper, who actually has some great mobile asset that we are integrating our cards programs with, particularly true for the smaller retailers maybe do not have a team sitting there to help them build out a mobile application. We are working with them to have that happen, so I think the whole digital pieces is going to become a bigger part of who we are and important part of how we go to market.","Rick Shane","Got it. Just to follow-up on that, I mean, as we enter into reporting season for peers as well, there are going to be a lot of questions over the next week about rewards and reward expenses. That's really where the competition seems to be playing out. We do not see that particularly in your margin or is there anything there that you are concerned about in terms of competitor behavior?","Brian Doubles","You know, there is nothing we are concerned about. You do see our loyalty costs are up, driven by the new value props that we have launched, but I think we look at these costs fundamentally just different than I think you look at them for general purpose card player in that the partner shares a significant portion of these costs.","What we like is that we can offer a very attractive value proposition like we launched at Sam's Club, and like we just recently launched with Amazon, and when it nets through with the RSA offset, we still earn a very attractive return on that program.","These new value props that we have launched are good things. They are driving growth, they are driving incremental finance charge revenue for the business, the partner share and part of the cost, so if we have the opportunity to launch better value props in our other programs, we are going to continue to look to do that. So we do not feel it necessarily as competitive pressure so much as we do a real opportunity to drive growth going forward.","Rick Shane","Got it. Great. Thank you guys.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Greg Ketron","Okay. Vanessa, we have time for one more question?","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. I guess, I have one question on Payment Solutions. It seems like you guys are definitely ramping up there in terms of the new relationships. Is there something there in terms of the economy that we can infer from, just the acceleration in new relationships there and should we expect more of that to occur as things get better in a broader sense?","Then I have another question just on the digital strategy. To the extent that you are able to enhance your capabilities, can that help you ask for more from your merchants in terms of revenues? Thanks.","Margaret Keane","Sure. Let me answer the first on Payment Solutions. I think interestingly enough, Sanjay, I think, one of the things that has worked to our benefit, believe it or not, is the separation from GE. In fact that many of these partners are seeing us as this is all we are going to be doing. We are 100% dedicated to the retail market so our activity overall and Payment Solution has really picked up and some of it is, obviously, I said we dedicated resources and they are going after that.","Even more importantly, we are getting people calling us, so I think there is a focus now that they know this is the business where are in and this is the business we are going to go after.","We are very strong in that business, we have a lot and that is really the heritage of our business, right? We have a strong team there and I think, we have invested in things that I think have really help us from a technology perspective, which many of those retailers, you have the bigger guys, they have a lot of smaller retailers there who really look to us to help them really bring capabilities and I think that is something that has really played well for us.","In terms of looking for more economics out of payment and mobile wallet, our goal is really to work with our partners to grow sales and we really see the wallet as really the final step in the process, so for us it is really building out the whole spectrum of the credit cycle applying, buying, getting a reward, getting your messaging and text messaging from us and then making a payment.","I would not anticipate us looking to get more from our partners. We really want to work with them together in the overall relationship to grow the business, so that is how we are thinking about it and that is our business model, right, bringing capabilities and making it a better experience for their customers to really help drive volume growth for them.","Sanjay Sakhrani","All right. Thank you.","Margaret Keane","Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Greg Ketron","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to further answer any questions you may have. Have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's conference.

Thank you for joining us today.","I'll start on Slide 3; the overall fundamentals of the business remain strong in the first quarter with net earnings of 552 million or $0.66 per share. Our growth drivers continued their solid trends helping to drive purchase volume of growth of 10%, loan receivable growth of 7% and platform revenue growth of 5%. We're seeing the impact of compelling new value propositions such as The Sam's Club 531 cash back program which was recently recognized with a PYMNTS.com innovator award.","Programs like this demonstrate the impact of engaging deeply with partners to help them develop innovative and effective ways to drive sales. Our focus on enhancing value for our partners and cardholders through digital offering has also helped to drive significant increase in online purchase volume. For the first quarter, digital purchase volume increased 18% compared to prior year. I will spend a few moments this morning outlining how our digital, loyalty and analytics capability are bringing value to our partnership. ","Asset quality improved with a 33 basis point decline in the net charge-off rate and a 30-basis point improvement in delinquency. Expenses were in line with our expectation impacted by investments we made to support the build-out of our standalone infrastructure as well as to help grow the business. We continue to generate solid deposit growth with the process increasing 8 billion or 28% over the first quarter of last year to 35 billion. Deposits now comprise 59% of our funding sources. And our balance sheet remains strong with Tier 1 common capital of 16.9% and liquidity of 14 billion at quarter end. Moving to our business highlights, we continue to capitalize on new business opportunities, forging partnerships across all three of our platforms. We extended our partnership with Amazon and now over 85% of retail card receivables are under contract to 2019 and beyond. We also announced a new Top 40 agreement with Guitar Center, the world\u2019s largest provider of musical instruments and recording equipment which we expect to launch in the second half of this year. ","Additionally, we launched a new CareCredit exclusive endorsement agreement with VSP, the nation\u2019s largest vision insurance provider. We are excited about these new partnerships and our ability to bring significant value to these relationships. At the same time we still have a meaningful opportunity to driver organic growth and we continue to pursue initiatives to promote card usage and deepen penetration. Also further progress has been made in our efforts to prepare for separation and we are on track to have the applications submitted to the [FED] in the second quarter. Our plans have not changed with GE\u2019s announcement last week that they are reducing the size of GE capital asset base. We continue to target separation by the end of this year.","Moving to Slide 4; I want to spend the next few minutes outlining the achievements we have made to expand the value we deliver to partners and customers specifically as it relates to our digital, loyalty and analytics capability. We have long viewed online and mobile as important channels for our business. These channels have evolved considerably over the last several years and will continue to evolve. As customer shopping behaviors have increasingly moved to digital, the importance of credit has solid suite.","Our digital strategies have helped drive a market increase in online and mobile purchase volume which is up 18% from last year. And nearly a third of our credit applications are done through digital channels. Our mobile capabilities cover the entire credit life cycle from acquisition to servicing to loyalty and payments. Our offerings include MFI which allows shoppers to securely apply for credit on their mobile device and instantly access their approved credit line. We also offer end service which allows customers to pay bills and service their account on their mobile device including obtaining their rewards. ","During the first quarter we announced that our MFI product will be available to our payment solution customers. Since launching the mobile applications in 2011 we have processed nearly 5 million applications through this channel for our retail card, CareCredit and now our payment solutions platform. We also offer digital cards, our proprietary digital version of our cards that enables in-store count look-up and mobile payments functionality. Piloted in 2014, the digital card leverages geo-locations for authentication and home screen icon for easy access post in moment for participating retailers.","In March we announced that we extended our digital card to our CareCredit platform enabling access to a digital version of our CareCredit card on their mobile device, since nearly half of all CareCredit purchase line is from existing card holders this was an important initiative. This coupled with our CareCredit online provider locator which received 600,000 hits monthly provides a power tool for increasing repeat purchases in this platform.","Mobile wallets are an important development in the mobile payment space and we are excited to announce our participation in Samsung Pay leveraging both MST and NFC technologies. Samsung Pay is accepted at 90% of retail merchants and allows our partners and customers to access the unique features and benefits of our cards. As you know we also announced our participation in Apple Pay and we have partners that are engaged with MCX and their currency platform, so we plan to support that technology as well. Through our innovation and strategic partnerships we have developed a mobile platform that can rapidly integrate with mobile wallet while preserving the benefits of our cards. We recently made a strategic investment in GPShopper an innovator developed of mobile apps with a focused on the retail industry. This partnership helps us build on our existing mobile platform to more easily integrate credit into the shopping experience with personalized offers, enhance account serving and loyalty programs.","We continue to design and launch new loyalty and value propositions for our partners. We are enhancing our loyalty capabilities by leveraging [indiscernible] platform to provide multi-tender loyalty programs allowing us to create a single seamless fully integrated loyalty solution regardless of tender yup.","Multi-tender loyalty programs were enabling our partners to market to an extend customer base, give our card holders access to a more seamless loyalty rewards program and it allows us to access the additional perspective card holders. Our analytics capabilities are an important component of the value we bring to our partner and customers. Currently, we receive SKU or category level data on over half of all transactions that occur on our network. We offer our retailers actionable analytics, market research and creative services to help them drive sales. Our data access affords us a wide array of opportunities to better analyze card holder spending to understand what they are buying and how they are shopping. We then work with our partners to customize offers that will increase engagement, sales and loyalty. ","Underlying our ability to provide distinct value to our partners and card holders is our proprietary close loop network. Our private label and co-branded dual cards run on our network which means that the transaction comes directly to us, enabling us to see the date of the purchase, name of the retailer, what brands and items were purchased and the channel through which this transaction occurred in store, online or via a mobile device. The volume of data to which we have access is immense and we've build the capabilities to transform this information into actionable insights. ","In summary, we will continue to seek ways to build, partner and invest in the latest technologies to further benefit our partners and customers. It's an exciting time in the evolving digital landscape and we\u2019re committed and positioned to continue to deliver value.","Slide 5 highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Purchase volume was 23 billion, an increase of 10% over last year. This helped to drive non-receivable growth of 7% to 58 billion. Our average active accounts were up to 62 million, a 4% increase from last year. And platform revenue was up 5% over the first quarter of last year. Many of our partners had positive growth in purchase volume and we continued to drive incremental growth for our value propositions and promotional financing offers. ","On the next slide I will spend a few minutes discussing the performance with each of our sales platforms before turning it over to Brian to give you more details on our financial results. ","We delivered solid performance across all three of our sales platforms in the first quarter. To our Retail Card platform we offer private label credits cards and a proprietary Dual Cards as well as small business products. The addition of DP which we announced last quarter will bring us to 20 retail card partners nationwide. Our retail card platform accounts for 68% of receivables and 69% of platform revenue. Our retail card performance was strong, with purchase volume growth of 10%, receivable growth of 7% and platform revenue growth of 5%. ","Renewing and extending our programs has been a key priority in this business. And as I outlined earlier we have been very successful in this regard. And we now have over 85% of our retail card receivables under contract to 2019 and beyond. The strong position we maintain in this space and the partnerships we have developed provide a solid foundation for future growth. Payment solution which accounts for 20% of our receivables and 15% of our platform revenue is a leading provider of promotional financing for major consumer purchases primarily in the home furnishing consumer electronics, jewelry, automotive and power product markets. ","Purchase volume was up 10% and average active accounts were up 8% over the same quarter last year, driving receivable growth of 11% and platform revenue growth of 8%. The majority of our industries have solid growth in both purchase volume and receivables including home furnishing, automotive products and power equipment. We\u2019ve recently signed a new partnership with Guitar Center and extended our Top-40 partnerships with MEGA Group USA a 1,700 member national home furnishings buying group of independent retailers. ","We also extended our Pep Boys partnerships, a key partner in our CarCareONE auto network. We continue to actively pursue a solid pipeline of potential new partnership opportunities in this platform. CareCredit which accounts for about 12% of our receivables and 16% of our platform revenue is a leading provider of financing to consumers for [selective] healthcare procedures that include dental, veterinary, cosmetic, vision and audiology services. Our partners in this platform are largely individual and small group of independent healthcare providers; the remainders are national and regional healthcare providers. ","During the quarter the majority of our specialty showed year over year growth in both purchase volume and receivable, with dental and veterinary turning the highest receivable growth. Purchase volume and average active account both increased 6%, helping to drive receivables growth of 4% and platform revenue growth of 5% over the same quarter of last year across each of our sales platform we delivered solid performance and continued the momentum of signing new partners, renewing and extending partners and working to drive organic growth. ","I will now turn the call over to Brian to provide a review of our financial performance for the quarter. ","Brian Doubles","Thanks Margaret. I will start on Slide 7 of the presentation. In the first quarter the business earned 552 million of net income which translates to $0.66 per diluted share in the quarter. Overall, the company continued to deliver strong top-line growth with purchase volume up 10% and receivables up 7%. Net interest income was up 5% compared to last year. This includes the impact of higher interest expense driven by the funding that was issued to increase liquidity in the third quarter last year. ","Interest income was up 7% which is in-line with our receivables growth. RSAs were up 66 million or 11%, driven by growth in the programs and improved credit performance compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.5% for the quarter consistent with the trends in both 2014 and 2013. We do expect the RSAs to trend just under the 4.5% level for 2015, consistent with what we communicated back in January. ","The provision declined 77 million or 10% compared to last year. The decrease was driven primarily by improving asset quality trends. There are a couple of things worth pointing out here. First, 30 plus delinquencies declined 30 basis points versus last year to 3.79%. And the net charge-off rates fell to 4.53% which is 33 basis points below last year. Our reserve coverage was fairly consistent compared to the first quarter last year, up slightly from 5.52% to 5.59%.","Measured against the last four quarters of net charge-offs the coverage remained relatively stable at 1.26 times. Other income decreased 14 million versus last year. The main driver here is higher loyalty expense related to the new value propositions we launched in the third quarter of last year. Interchange was up 24 million driven by continued growth and out of stores spending our Dual Card. This is offset by loyalty expense that was up 35 million primarily driven by the new value proposition. As a remainder, we run the interchange and loyalty expense back through our RSAs so there is a partial offset on each of these items.","Debt cancellation fees of $65 million were down 5 million from last year due to the fact that only offer the product now through our online channel. Other expenses increased 136 million versus the first quarter last quarter. Last year's results included a $44 million benefit related to a reduction in reserves for certain regulatory matters. Adjusting for that, expenses were up 92 million or 14%. The remaining increase was due to three main drivers all of which are consistent with prior quarters.","First, we're making investments to support ongoing growth particularly in our Retail Card program. As many of you are aware, we have completed long-term extensions with many of our large partners and as part of those renewals we set aside more dollars in the marketing and growth funds to support those programs.","Second, we also launched our new branding campaign in September and continued our marketing efforts with a focus on our deposit products. And lastly, we continue to invest in the infrastructure build as we execute our plan to separate from GE.","So overall, the business had a solid quarter. We had strong balance sheet growth and good top-line growth generating an ROA of 3%. ","I'll move to Slide 8 and walk you through our net interest income and margin trends. As I mentioned on the prior slide, interest income growth was strong at 7% in line with our receivables growth. This was partially offset by higher funding cost related to the additional liquidity we're carrying on the balance sheet compared to last year. The net interest margin declined to 15.79%, which was a little better than our expectations. This is due to using some of the liquidity that seasonally builds up in the first quarter to pay down the bank term loan facility and pay off GE Capital loan and I will cover this later when I discuss our funding profile.","As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth highlighting. The majority of the variance, approximately 250 basis point was driven by the build in our liquidity portfolio. We increased liquidity on the balance sheet to nearly $14 billion, which is up $9 billion versus last year. We have the cash conservatively invested in short-term treasuries and deposits at the FED, which results in a lower yield than the rest of our earning assets.","The yield on our receivables declined 34 basis points as a result of slightly higher payment rates in the quarter compared to the last year and the impact of portfolio mix given the strong growth we're seeing in our promotional offers and payment solutions. As Margaret mentioned earlier, payment solutions grew receivable 11% over the last year.","Lastly, on interest expense, the overall rate increased to 1.9%, up 28 basis points compared to last year. This is in line with our expectations given the changes in our funding profile. I'll walk you through our breakdown by funding source.","First, the cost of our deposits was relatively stable, up 9 basis points to 1.6%. The increase was driven by extending the average tenor of our direct retail CDs partially offset by growth in our lower rate savings account product. Our deposit base increased over 8 billion or 28% year-over-year. We continue to be very focused on growing our deposit base and making this a larger funding source going forward. Securitization funding costs increased 20 basis points to 1.5%. This is driven by extending some maturities in our Master Note Trust and the addition of 6.6 billion of undrawn securitization capacity.","Our other debt costs increased 84 basis points to 3.2% due to the higher rates on the GE Capital and bank term loan facility as well as the unsecured bond. It\u2019s worth noting here that the majority of the new bonds we issued in the quarter are fixed rates, so we have replaced in variable rate funding for longer-dated fixed-rate funding and this will benefit us in a rising rate environment.","Over the past several quarters, our margin has changed significantly due to the factors I just mentioned. The primary drivers are the liquidity build and the cost of the new funding sources we put in place after the IPO. While the first quarter margin was a little above the range we set out back in January, this is primary driven by the benefit of using some excess liquidity to pay down the GE Capital and bank loans. Given we don\u2019t expect a similar benefit in future quarters; we will likely see our margin move back in the 15% to 15.5% range we communicated back in January.","And next I will cover our key credit trends on Slide 9, but before I get to that I thought it would be helpful to provide some perspective on the seasonal trends and impact allowance coverage from the fourth quarter to the first quarter. As you'd expect we typically see a significant receivables billed during the holiday season. The allowance coverage as a percentage of receivables typically comes down a bit in the fourth quarter as customers pay down a significant portion of the holiday balances in the first quarter and a higher proportion of delinquent accounts don't translate into losses.","Then in the first quarter as the holiday balances are paid down, you will see the allowance coverage revert back to levels of more consistent with other quarters. As you look back at the 2014 allowance coverage, this will give you a sense for the seasonality. The coverage was in the 5.5% range for the first three quarters, very similar to our result this quarter. So looking more specifically to the first quarter results, as I noted earlier we continue to see stable to improving trends on asset quality, 30 plus delinquencies were 3.79% down 30 basis points versus last year 90 plus delinquencies were 1.81% down 12 basis points. We believe these improvements are driven at least impart by lower gas prices and generally a healthier consumer. Net charge-offs also improved to 4.53% down 33 basis points versus last year.","Lastly, the allowance from loan losses as the percent of receivables was 5.59% which increased from the prior quarter for seasonality but was fairly consistent with the first quarter of last year. Another metric you can use to measure reserve coverage is to compare the reserve to the 12 months charge-offs. We\u2019re currently at 1.26 times coverage which equates to roughly 15 months lost coverage in our reserve. This is always fairly consistent with the level throughout 2014.","So overall we continue to feel good about the performance of our portfolio and the underlying economic trend we\u2019re seeing. To give in those factors we believe that our credit trends will continue to be stable.","Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses were in line with our expectations. As I noted earlier last year\u2019s results included a $44 million benefit related to a reduction in reserves for certain regulatory matters. After adjusting for that item expenses were up 92 million or 14%. And this increase was driven primarily by incremental investments in our programs as well as the infrastructure we\u2019re building as part of our separation from GE.","Employee costs were up 46 million as we added additional employees over the past year to support growth in the business and the infrastructure build as we prepare for separation. Professional fees were up 32 million due to both growth in the business as well as cost to separate from GE. ","Marketing and business development costs were essentially flat to last year. We continue to invest in our programs and our marketing efforts around our deposit platforms as well as branding. However given the significant success in growing deposit and the excess liquidity in the first quarter we did see an opportunity to dial back some of the marketing cost for deposits. Information processing was up 11 million on higher IT investment and transaction volumes compared to last year.","So overall our efficiency ratio was 32.2% for the quarter, which is below the 34% target we provided back in January. We continue to believe we have a very scalable platform and while the efficiency ratio will climb modestly from here through the remainder of the year we expect to stay below our target level of 34%. ","Moving to Slide 11, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy is the continued growth of our deposit base. We view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business. Over the last year we\u2019ve grown our deposit by 8 billion primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 59% of our funding; we are well positioned to meet our long-term target of being 60% to 70% deposit funding.","Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $14 billion to $15 billion range which is approximately 24% of our funding. We did issue 750 million of new debt in March, the debt was five year fixed and price at 2.37% which was a little better than we expected given the strong demand. Our unsecured bond offerings have also been well received. In January we issued 1 billion of five year unsecured bonds, 750 million of which was fixed rate and price to 2.7%. The remaining 250 million was floating rate.","Lastly, I want to highlight some recent developments related to the bank term loan facility and the GE capital loan. First, as we\u2019ve said in the past our strategy is to continue to reduce our reliance on the bank term loan facility and GE capital for funding. These are more expensive forms of financing for us and not part of our long-term strategy. ","During the quarter we made 3.2 billion of prepayments from the bank and GE capital loans, this included 2.8 billion of pro rata payments in January and February and then in March we made an additional $400 million payment on the GE capital loan which paid the loan off in full.","Since the IPO we have paid down the bank and GE capital loans from 9.5 billion to 5.7 billion today, which is ahead of our original expectation. So we\u2019ve really made a lot of progress on the strategy to reduce a reliance on these sources. So overall we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources. We\u2019ll continue to focus on growing our direct deposit platform and using the proceeds from future unsecured bonds to further prepay the bank term loan facility. ","Turning to capital, we ended the quarter at 15.9% Tier 1 common under Basel I. This translates to 16.4% common equity Tier 1 under the fully phased in Basel III guidance. And consistent with prior communication we do not plan to return capital through dividends or buyback until we complete the separation from GE, so we do expect our capital levels will continue to increase during that time. Post separate we\u2019d expect to begin returning capital in line with our peers.","Moving to liquidity, total liquidity increased to 20.4 billion and is comprised of 13.8 billion in cash and short term treasuries and an additional 6.6 billion in undrawn securitization capacity. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 28% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR level.","Overall we\u2019re executing on the strategy that we outlined previously, we\u2019ve build a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity level. And with I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret. ","Margaret Keane ","Thanks Brian, I\u2019ll close with the summery of the quarter on Slide 12 and then we\u2019ll begin the Q&A portion of the call. During the quarter we exhibited strong broad-based growth across several key areas, continuing the momentum we've generated over the last several quarters. We continue to make our cards valuable to consumers, retailers and merchants. Notably in the first quarter we announced that our card would be available on the new Samsung Pay mobile wallet. Leveraging the early investment we made in [indiscernible].","From our business development perspective we continue to win and renew important partnership as well as sign key endorsements and maintain a healthy pipeline of additional opportunities. Our focus is steadfast; we will continue to deliver value to our partners and customers while leveraging strong engagement, innovation and advanced analytics to drive growth. At the same time we remain acutely focused on our preparation from separation from GE and look forward to providing update as we move closer to the finish line. ","I will now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A. ","Greg Ketron","Thanks Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. Operator we\u2019re now ready to begin the Q&A session. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions). And our first question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. ","Moshe Orenbuch ","I guess you had 7% growth in receivables and in core platform and across the company, in what is now turning out to be a little bit more sluggish probably industry setting than we had been thinking just a couple of months ago. Can you talk a little bit about how much the industry setting effects that and what might happen if things were to get a little better from a consumer stand point? ","Brian Doubles","This is Brian. I think it certainly impacts it a little bit. Retail sales in January and February were pretty soft. They came back a little bit in March; we saw a little bit pickup as well in our sales which is maybe a positive. I don't think it's enough to really read too much into it. If you look at our growth year-over-year certainly the value proposition that we rolled out in third quarter helped us a bit. If you adjust for portfolio exit our active accounts were up 8%. We\u2019re also seeing pretty good purchase volume per active account; it was up 6% versus last year. So that tells you that even though we\u2019re in a relatively weak retail sales environment. Consumers are still seeing real value on our cards and they are spending more on their accounts which is a positive. ","Online sales were up 18% that continues to be a positive for us, and then if you look at CareCredit and payment solutions specifically as we talked about in the past one of the things that\u2019s benefitting our results here a little bit is just the amount of reuse that we\u2019re getting on the cards. It's the reuse for CareCredit as a percent of purchase volume was about 49%, that\u2019s up 45% last year. So that continues to grow, which is helpful. Payment solutions reuse was 26% which is up a little bit versus last year as well. So a lot of what we\u2019re doing to market to consumers in both of those platforms and create awareness around where you can use the cards is helping. ","As we said back in January -- we were calling for retail sales to be in the 2% to 3% range, so our 6% to 8% receivable forecast was really based on that. So we didn't really have a lot of lift in the numbers based on retail sales. So I would say they are coming in a little bit below what we expected but not that dramatically off. ","Moshe Orenbuch ","Got it. Just on a completely separate topic Brian. You mentioned marketing growth it looks I guess form the slides that the market expense actually flat in that, was it investments in other areas that were part of marketing? ","Brian Doubles","There is a couple of things going on there, if you look at just the marketing line, we made continued investments in the program that was offset by lower marketing spend on retail deposits. And so one of the dynamics that you see when you look year-over-year, when we were in the first quarter of 2014 and we\u2019re really ramping up the deposit platform ahead of the IPO we are spending a lot of marketing related to retail deposits. ","Fast forward to the first quarter 2015 and we were -- we were still growing retail deposits but we were in an excess liquidity position so we saw that as an opportunity to dial back a little bit on the marketing spend related to deposits. So what you really got is incremental investments in the programs offset by lower spend on retail deposits. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW. ","Sanjay Sakhrani ","I guess I had question on liquidity, understanding you guys want to stay on the conservative side. Could you just talk about how liquidity will ramp or not going forward just based on growth and then maybe how you might be able to reallocate some of the investments that you are investing in towards a little bit higher return type of assets? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Sure, so it's a little bit -- going from the fourth quarter to the first quarter you're always going to see an increase in liquidity just given the pay down on receivables. So we definitely saw that in the first quarter. We did us about 2 billion of that excess liquidity to make prepayments on the GE Capital and the bank loan, so as you know as we said in the past if we have the opportunity to optimize the amount of liquidity that we're carrying we\u2019re certainly look to do that. I wouldn't think about it going forward, I wouldn't think about a step change either up or down in terms of the absolute amount of liquidity that we're holding on the balance sheet. We're going to continue to run a very conservative balance sheet, we think that\u2019s prudent just given we're still building a track record in the capital markets, we've got rating agency consideration, regulatory considerations, et cetera.","So I can tell you it\u2019s something we spend a lot of time on. We run lot of internal stress tests. We obviously look at the LCR guidance that's clearly not a constraint for us. We're looking at our maturities coverage and then in quarters where we do think we have an opportunity to use some of that liquidity and take out some higher cost funding and we\u2019ll certainly look to do that. The other thing is that we're looking at -- right now we've got about 40 billion of liquidity, 4 billion of that is in short-dated treasuries, 10 billion roughly is sitting in cash deposits at the FED. We're clearly not earning a lot on that liquidity portfolio. I think that's an opportunity going forward, a great start to move, one may look to do something a little bit different there. We don't have any plans to invest in anything that\u2019s not high quality liquid asset and you\u2019re getting a 100% credit for under the LCR guidance, but there is some opportunity to go out a bit on duration and pick up a little more yield, so you might see us do that in the future.","Sanjay Sakhrani ","Okay that's helpful, just a one quick follow-up, it's on the opportunities out there for portfolio acquisitions within the private label area or co-brand area, maybe Margaret you can talk about what's out there. I've heard there is a number of deals up or out for renewal at some point in 2016 through 2017, do you guys have eye an on those as well? Thanks.","Margaret Keane","So actually we see that our pipeline is pretty strong. I think we've mentioned we invested in additional business development resources and we've really kind of aligned ourselves around the three platforms, so I would say from a pipeline perspective in all three platforms we feel pretty good. I would also tell you that we're seeing opportunities in really two key areas; one is the first one you're saying which is portfolios that are up renewal; that are with competitors that we can go out after; and then the second is startup trust. So I've mentioned in the past that we like startups, many of our big portfolios that we have today were actually startups. So I think the team is diligently focused on growth. I think for us the really opportunity is really insuring that we pick those portfolios that really work for us. As we've said in the past, we have -- the biggest opportunity is really in organic growth. So as we continue to focus on organic we can be a bit choosier on the portfolios we go after to make sure they really aligned with the returns we're trying to achieve for the overall business.","Operator","And our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","I just had a question on credit, the provision I think came in the low-end of expectations and your delinquency trends continue to show improvement and Brian I think you've said your outlook is for relatively stable, but how should we think about the trajectory of provisions for the remainder of the year? Should we expect to see losses show any further improvement and could we actually start to see some -- the level of reserves coming down a bit just given the positive improvement in credit losses?","Brian Doubles","I think, as I've mentioned, the charge-offs for the quarter 30 plus, 90 plus were probably little bit better that we expected. We do we're getting a little of the benefit here on lower gas prices, improving employment helps, but it's really -- it's one quarter so it's hard to draw a much of trend from it at this point. The studies around gas prices say the consumers are -- they're using 25% of those gas savings to reduce debt. We definitely feel like we're feeling a piece of that in the numbers that's why you see the reserve coverage is held pretty stable. We didn't make a big move up or down, it's 5.59%, it was really more or less flat to where we trended all last year; up a little bit for seasonality, but very consistent to where we were last year. So I don't think -- we're not seeing anything absent a little bit of improvement from gas that would prompt us to call anything other than we think we\u2019re in a pretty stable environment right now and we don't see losses creeping up in the next 12 months, we don't see them getting a lot of better from here, add to that the significant change on gas prices.","Ryan Nash","Got it and then just on your comment Brian about the [NIM] moving back into the 15% to 15.5% range, does that assume any further pay downs to the term loan and could we end up seeing more term loan paid down and maybe replace that with deposits so we could actually see if the [NIM] maybe running above the top end of the range? ","Brian Doubles","We had kind of the base plan that assumed a certain level of prepayments on the bank loan. So that\u2019s already -- a portion of that\u2019s already incorporated in the guidance that we provided back in January. Now in the first quarter we had an incremental opportunity to what we originally forecast and we took advantage of that in the quarter. We don\u2019t see anything incremental to the plan right now, but if we were to find ourselves with excess liquidity again you know our strategy is to make some additional prepayments if we can. The bank term loan facility runs out until 2019, we\u2019re obviously going to prepay it well in advance of that maturity. And we\u2019ll just kind of go quarter-by-quarter here and see if we can lean into it a little bit more.","Ryan Nash","Got it. If I can squeeze one quick one, last one in there. Margaret just given what we\u2019ve seen across the industry competitively you guys simply in a very good position in terms of your maturities, your partnerships but has here been any consideration to trying to extent some of your bigger partnerships to locking the relationships?","Margaret Keane","I think we mentioned that we actually have locked in many of our relationships as we were going through the IPO process and into this year. So we\u2019re always looking at ways to extend our partnerships and usually pumping pops up along the way whether it\u2019s a new product they want to roll out or maybe a different value prom. So it\u2019s kind of how we run the business. We\u2019re always looking at ways to really expand and expand the relationships. Right now we feel pretty good where we are, 85% of the retail card relationships are locked up 2019 and beyond. We just did Amazon which was a really nice win for us. There are couple of more we\u2019re working on. So I think this is kind of how we run the business and always looking to see how we can lock those up for a longer term.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht ","Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. A little bit -- talk to Moshe\u2019s question on growth; is there any way to attribute either the loan growth or the purchase volume growth to increase penetration in various accounts versus average balance trends at the customer level? ","Margaret Keane","I would say if you look at the industries or the platform themselves we actually saw a very nice growth in our payment solution business and a lot of that was actually attributed to things related to housing, where we saw good and solid furniture sales, our auto business as well in that vertical as well. So I think the positive is that it seems like consumers are back spending on their home and reinvesting in their home; so we see that a positive trend. I\u2019ll turn it over Brian and see if he would add anything else on penetration. ","Brian Doubles","I think the [indiscernible] thing might just be helpful to describe a little bit how we measure our platforms. So if we take retail card we start at the beginning of the year with a sales plan for the retailer that we work with them on and then we measure those retail programs based on gaining penetration. So if the retailer is growing 2%, we\u2019re looking to grow sales on our card at least 4% to 6% and that\u2019s how we measure ourselves. So if you think about how we built the plan, I would assume generally retail sales 2% to 3% and purchase volume for us was 10% and the delta there is largely tender shift from general purpose card, other payment types onto our card.","John Hecht ","That\u2019s great color, thanks. Little bit of homer question that I know I can get from the 10-Q but if you have it handed, do you have the net charge-offs on cards versus installment loan versus commercial credit handy?","Brian Doubles","I don\u2019t think we report that separately. ","John Hecht ","Okay. Thanks very much. ","Brian Doubles","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup. ","Don Fandetti ","I guess at this point the most probable scenario is you would be regulated as a savings in loan, is there are any chance that you would have to go through formal [CCAR]? And then can you talk a little bit more specifically about a targeted payout ratio as the card issuers tend to have much higher payout ratios for the banks?","Brian Doubles","Yes, Don you\u2019re right we\u2019ll be regulated as a savings and loan holding company so we\u2019re not technically subject to [CCAR]. It will be up to the FED on what they want to put us through. I can tell you though that we\u2019ve been preparing this we\u2019ll be subject to [CCAR], so we\u2019re running the same stress test, using the same assumptions, building the same models. We\u2019re putting in the same governance processes around our stress test and our capital plan. So that\u2019s how we\u2019re preparing. We do think that whether not we\u2019re subject to the formal [CCAR] the FED is very likely going to regulate us just like they regulate similar banks of our size. So that\u2019s our plan. ","Don Fandetti ","Okay. ","Brian Doubles","In terms of payout ratio expectation I think there is a couple of things, obviously we don\u2019t report anything publically on our stress test so it\u2019s tough to get into a lot of detail, but there is a couple of things to think about. First we\u2019re starting up with very strong capital levels and we reported close to 17% Tier 1 common. Business generates very strong returns; the business model is fairly resilient in the stress similar to what you see from the other credit card peers. So we think we perform in a very similar fashion and overtime we would expect to have payout ratios that look very similar to our peers. Did you have one other question?","Don Fandetti ","Yeah Brian, thank you. Margaret is there any update on potential general purpose card issuance and then maybe other additional businesses given the success of your bank so far?","Margaret Keane","I didn't hear the second part. ","Don Fandetti ","In terms of any other potential products that you may look at given the bank success in the [indiscernible]. ","Margaret Keane","So we've mentioned in the past that we would like to launch a general purpose Synchrony Financial Card to our bank. The teams are evaluating that and working on it, that will probably be more of a 2016 launch than 2015 launch, but the teams working on that. In terms of other products I think we said we are really looking at the bank platform as a way to launch some other products, like checking, debit, bill pay. So that\u2019s another whole area that team is working on, again I think that will be more over 2016 launch. But plans are in place for that and the teams are hard at work figuring out the right way to do that. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. ","Betsy Graseck","Just two questions, one was on the [NIM] pressure that came from receivable yield and I know you highlighted that that was imparted from growth in promotional balances. So just wanted to a sense of how you are thinking about promotional balances, is it little bit more seasonal in the first quarter or should we anticipate a ramp as we go through the year? Just a little on how you are thinking about that.","Brian Doubles","I would -- we tied it to a promotional balances, it\u2019s really driven by Payment Solutions just having a really great quarter and lot of growth year-over-year, they were up 11%. And if you look at Payment Solutions yield just compared to the average product portfolio or compared to CareCredit or Retail Card it is a lower yielding book. So that\u2019s the biggest driver. I wouldn't assume a ramp or seasonality in that, Betsy, I think Payment Solutions growth is just a little bit better than we expected, which drove a little bit of that yield decline. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay.","Brian Doubles","And then the other factor that did have an impact in the quarter was just -- we did see some higher payment rates, lower delinquencies that obviously has an impact on yield as well. So those are really the two drivers. ","Betsy Graseck","So high quality problems?","Brian Doubles","It\u2019s a high quality problem, we agree.","Betsy Graseck","Okay and then separately on the plan of shifting more private label card to Dual Card. Could we please talk a little bit about plans and strategies and rollout for that and should we be bake in an acceleration in the model?","Margaret Keane","I wouldn't bake in an acceleration. I think what we are always looking to do is look at growth both from our private label and Dual Card. One of the things we are always looking at is getting more of our partners to participate in the Dual Card and there is still some opportunities there that we are working through. Dual Card definitely is a positive for us in terms of driving growth on the overall portfolio and the other positive it gives us is when we can offer both products in a partnership, a private label and Dual, if we were to hit a cycle or bump, we can always just shift to getting out more private label credit cards to ensure we get the customer card in their hand but really protect us on the backend from losses. So that kind of our strategy and how we think about Dual Card. ","Betsy Graseck","Okay and you get some nice [indiscernible] on a Dual Card as well. So again just thinking out loud about how to model that, should we take in -- kind of growth rate that you have been generating recently? Or do you anticipate that there is going to be an acceleration, and I guess your point is more steady state acceleration. ","Brian Doubles","This is a strategy that we've had in place for four years where we start consumers up with a lower line on PLCC and we upgrade them overtime, and that strategy has been pretty consistent. If we are going to change that in future and do something bigger we would always come and we will describe it at that point. But it really is something that\u2019s been fairly consistent I would say over the last three or four years. ","Operator","Our next question comes from Kevin St. Pierre with Sanford Bernstein. ","Kevin St. Pierre","If you could just approach the competition for existing portfolios from a different perspective. There has been a lot of news flow over the past year plus about retailers looking for potentially a credit utility to use a term that American Express put out there. Are you seeing any shift in your conversations or shift in the market towards retailers who are just looking for the best possible returns for themselves or has nothing changed in your mind?","Margaret Keane","We haven't really seen a change there. What I would say is that the retailers that we talked to are the partners that we are going after. The number one thing that the retailer really wants is for us to describe how we are going to bring more sales in and how we are going to bring more customers and how we are going to have their customers be more loyal. And they really first start up by focusing on our capabilities and I think things like mobile becoming much more important aspect of their business as well as where we can come in and help them from a data analytics perspective, helping them do the marketing campaigns and really driving sale. We have not seen that shift where they are asking for things what would be outside of the normal things we would in a standard contract. So I haven't really seen any of that in any of the conversations that we've had.","Kevin St. Pierre","Okay great and separately, on the deposit platform obviously strong growth year-over-year kind of flattish quarter-to-quarter but as you\u2019ve said, you sort of backed off a bit in the marketing. Do you have any sense or any metrics you could share with us in terms of market share gains either of deposits or deposit growth and how you're faring against other direct deposit gathers?","Brian Doubles","We're definitely taking share, I don't have a specific number for you, but our growth rates have far outpaced direct -- other online direct retail program growth rate, and so that continues to be a big focus for us. So we've been very pleased by the growth that we're seeing. I'd say we're also -- the other place we\u2019re really focused is on retention rates and the retention rates on our CDs. We've bought the platform from that MetLife back in January of 2013. Retention rates were around 80%. They are up to 88% today, so there is -- there is evidence that our efforts there are definitely paying off. We rolled out a loyalty program where out deposit customers depending on how much they have deposited with us and how long they\u2019ve been a customer, they get access to travel savings and benefits. And so we think it's a really -- it's a combination of paying attractive rates, getting the right advertising program in place, but then also offering something else as part of the equation and that's what we're trying to do with the loyalty programs that we've rolled out.","Operator","Thank you. And our next question is from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Just moving back on the competitive environment, any view on the emerging online lenders and marketplace lenders looking at to obviously just throughout some of your channel like CareCredit and point of sale financings, and also there is obviously more talk about correlation partners in the U.S., do you see that as a threat or maybe on the flipside potentially an opportunity for you guys?","Margaret Keane","Sure, I\u2019ll take that, I'll take that separately. So the first one; I would say -- we see competition really holding the way it been through this cycle and our pipeline continues to be strong, so we're feeling some of the pressure that I think others are seeing out there particularly on the bigger transaction. So for us, as I said earlier, our pipeline is really robust, we see it strong in all three platforms and we feel really good about where we're positioned. I think on the coalition question, I think it's a really good question. We have some experience in correlations, we have a network called CarCareONE which actually is a network comprised of our retail partners that are in the auto space if you will, and that correlations actually has turned out to be a very positive for us, we're seeing nice growth in that and that's where your card can be used at multiple paces. So if you have a Pep Boys card for instance you can use it in some of the other retail -- auto retailers that are in that correlation. So we like this concept, it's something that we're evaluating to see, could you expand that into other verticals, is there for instance an opportunity in a home vertical for instance, is something we've been talking about.","We're definitely keeping our eye on this. I think as consumers shop they continue to look for opportunities rewards and feeling like they need some little lift to shop, so things like creating a correlations and offering rewards across network I think is a really important. In terms of the competition from some of these online [sales], we're really not feeling the pressure from them. I think their products are different, there installment products not revolving. I think Brian mentioned earlier particularly in our CareCredit business, we're seeing multiple reuse of our cards so we've really been able to really gain brand in the market place.","And then lastly in terms of how they have to sell into the market, they have to actually sell on the -- and the CareCredit space you're actually going dental office by dental office to try to create an overall business and so we've been at this for our 25 years and we think it's going to them a little bit while to catch up to us. So we feel pretty confident about where we're against those competitors.","Brian Doubles","Operator, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question comes from James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James Friedman","Margaret, in your operating remarks you had commented about some of the growth in digital referencing to Slide 4, I realized in the footnotes that it says digital is both online and mobile, I was just wondering if you could parse those a little bit, what do you see in terms of the dynamics of mobile versus online -- yeah I think if you could share with us that, that would be helpful?","Margaret Keane","It's hard to break that out. We're working on trying to figure out if we can get that metric because to go by a device and so for instance your iPad looks like an online versus mobile phone, so it's a little hard for us to break that out. What I would -- suffice to say, we think a lot of that is happening on, on more of the mobile side and iPad side of things if you will, so little hard to break that out. Needlessness to say, I think all of us now are -- if you could just and by me, how I shop, I think more and more this is a big growth area of us and something that we continue to have to really make that experience for that customer pretty seamless.","David Ho","Just one quick one follow up, you say that digital growth was 18% year-over-year, is that a lot or a little, could you give us a reference point as to what it was previously as it accelerated?","Margaret Keane","We think it\u2019s a pretty descent, if you look at it compared to what -- there is a metric out there that says overall in the U.S. it grew 15%, we grew 18%; so I think we are beating out what the norm is. So that\u2019s a measure to go on. Again, it\u2019s just continues grows quarter-over-quarter and it\u2019s not only on sales we see it on everything, the number of logins, the number of people who are on M-service now, the number of people who start mobile and only use mobile in terms of M-service. For us it\u2019s just a metric we continue to watch and know that it\u2019s a very important one and one that just continues to grow from all aspects of the platform.","Brian Doubles","All right. Thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning, your interest in Synchrony Financial.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results and a 2017 outlook.","I\u2019ll begin on Slide 3. Fourth quarter net earnings totaled $576 million or $0.70 per diluted share. We draw significant broad-based growth in each of our sales platforms, which resulted in double-digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income for the company. We also grew purchase volume 9% over the fourth quarter of last year.","Looking at just our online and mobile purchase volume, sales grew 20%, far exceeding U.S. growth trends, which have been around 15%. And our Retail Card online sales penetration reached 25% in the fourth quarter.","Looking at asset quality, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.32% compared to 4.06% last year, and our net charge-off rate was 4.62% compared to 4.23% in the fourth quarter of last year. Our strong revenue growth and expense discipline has yielded robust operating leverage, and put our efficiency ratio at 31.6% for the quarter, approximately 240 basis points lower than last year.","Supporting our growth was another quarter of significant deposit generation, which increased $9 billion, or 20%, to $52 billion. Deposits now comprise 72% of our funding source. By focusing on competitive rates and exceptional customer service, we plan to continue to drive deposit growth. The longer term we expect for that growth to trend more in line with our receivables growth.","Our balance sheet remain strong with the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 17.2% and liquid assets totaling $14 billion, or 15% of total assets at quarter end. And we were pleased to pay our quarterly common stock dividend payments of $0.13 and repurchased $238 million of our common stock during the quarter. This augments the capital we are deploying through our strong balance sheet growth.","And the biggest driver of that growth continues to be organic growth. At the same time, we are pursuing new partnerships and we are pleased to have launched our new Fareportal program during the fourth quarter. The program includes the Dual Card and private label products for their brands. This is the first credit card program from an online travel agency to include a special financing offer to help manage the cost of travel and also includes an enhanced loyalty program.","In addition, CareCredit announced a new multi-year agreement with Henry Schein Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of Henry Schein, Inc., the world\u2019s largest provider of healthcare products and services, to office-based dental, animal health, and medical practitioners. This strategic alliance will include the integration of CareCredit financing into Henry Schein\u2019s leading practice management software solutions, co-marketing programs and collaboration on prospective value-added services.","We are continuously working on the development of solutions to improve functionality, and ease of use for mobile, an increasingly important sales channel. For example, this quarter we launched SyPi, a of fully integrated Synchrony plug-in credit feature for our retailers\u2019 app, which we developed with GPShopper.","The plug-in allows credit card holders to easily shop, redeem rewards, and securely manage and make payments on their accounts via their mobile device. Cardholders can view account balances and purchase activity, make payments, and check available credit limits for quick-and-easy purchasing decision, all within the retail\u2019s app. It can be quickly integrated and is fully customizable for the retailer, and easily integrated into their existing app enhancing the mobile shopping experience, increasing customer engagement and boosting loyalty.","We are also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter we introduced Pay My Provider, a secure online payment portal that allows cardholders to pay their outstanding balances with their CareCredit card anytime, anywhere and on any device.","It provides cardholders a convenient and secure payment option. Patients can choose from the available financing options and submit a payment directly to the provider using their CareCredit card. We continue to drive strong results this quarter, developing, extending and deepening relationships to drive value for our partners, cardholders and shareholders.","Moving to Slide 4, which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter. Loan receivables growth remains strong at 12%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 9% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans also grew 12% over the fourth quarter of last year. We are delivering value to partners and cardholders through attractive value proposition, promotional financing and strategic marketing offers and this is helping to drive strong results.","On the next slide, I\u2019ll discuss this quarter\u2019s performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to generate strong growth across all three of our sales platforms as shown in Slide 5. Retail Card delivered another quarter a strong performance. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 5%.","Interest and fees on loans increased 12%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad-based growth across Retail Card partner program continued in the fourth quarter. Over the last year, we have leveraged our expertise to attract new partners in the travel and entertainment space. And we have won several new partners in this segment in 2016. During the fourth quarter we launched an exciting new program with Fareportal.","We look forward to deepening these relationships and continuing to attract new partners as we build our business in this attractive segment. Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 15% was driven by purchase volume growth of 13% and, average active account growth of 12%. Interest and fees on loans increased 13%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables with home furnishing, automotive products and power leading the way.","During the quarter, we announced a new partnership with CFMOTO, to be the exclusive provider of consumer financing for products sold in the U.S. and VP usage continue to be strong across Payment Solutions, representing 28% of purchase volume in the fourth quarter.","CareCredit delivered another strong quarter as well. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 10% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth.","Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties. And we are pleased to have announced the new multi-year agreement with Henry Schein Financial Services, LLC, expanding the network in utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive our reuse rate of 53% of purchase volume in the quarter.","2016 was a year of significant progress. We generated strong organic growth across each of our sales platforms driving solid revenue growth, substantial operating leverage and attractive returns. In addition, we signed several key relationships and expanded our network and card utility, while continuing to innovate valuable digital solutions and expand our analytics capabilities to bring value to our partners and customers.","Our direct deposit platform has continued to support our growth, as we have successfully extended this lower-cost funding source. All of this success has contributed to our ability to return capital to shareholders, not only through robust growth, but now also via payment of dividends and through our share repurchase program.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Margaret. I\u2019ll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the fourth quarter, the business earned $576 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share in the quarter.","We continue to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 9% and, both receivables and interest in fees on loans up 12%. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth we generated across the business in 2016. We had another strong quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 6% year-over-year, driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards, which continue to resonate with consumers.","The positive trends continued in average balances and spend, with growth in average balance per average active account up 5% compared to last year, and purchase volume per average active account increasing 3% over the last year.","The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $253 million compared to last year. The increase was driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.32% compared to 4.06% last year. And the net charge-off rate was 4.62% compared to 4.23% last year. The full-year net charge-off rate was 4.5% in line with the outlook of 4.3% to 4.5% we provided at the beginning of 2016.","Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.69%. Reserves were in line with the view we provided last quarter. Coverage typically declines in the fourth quarter due to the seasonal build in receivables and coverage came down 13 basis points compared to the third quarter as we expected.","The asset quality metrics, which I\u2019ll cover in more detail later, are in line with our expectations and reflect the gradual pace of normalization that we highlighted this year. RSAs were up $77 million compared to last year, RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.4% for the quarter, compared to 4.5% last year. The slightly lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailer sharing in the incremental provision expense, which offsets the increase in sharing from the year-over-year revenue growth and lower expense growth.","On a full-year basis, the RSA percentage was 4.2%, which was in line with the 4.2% to 4.3% range we had expected. The reserve build in the second quarter of 2016 resulted in the RSA running at a lower level than previous years. Looking forward into 2017, we think the RSAs will move back closer to the 4.4% to 4.5% range, near the levels we had been running at prior to 2016.","Other income was essentially flat versus last year. While interchange was up $20 million, driven by continued growth in auto store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by a loyalty expense that increased by $32 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a remainder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back to the RSAs, so there was a partial offset on each of these items.","Higher debt cancellation fees and other income offset the impact of higher loyalty expense net of interchange. Other expenses increased $48 million or 6% versus last year, driven by growth and bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms and our direct deposit program as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities.","The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 31.6%, significantly lower than last year due to the strong operating leverage we have generated this year. I\u2019ll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter with strong revenue and net earnings growth compared to prior year.","I\u2019ll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 13%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.22% for the quarter, up 49 basis points over last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are a few dynamics worth pointing out.","First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in earlier in 2016. We\u2019re also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth. The yield on receivables increased 17 basis points to 21.36%, driven by slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year.","We also realized a modest benefit from the increase in the primary compared to the prior year. Lastly, funding costs improved by 2 basis points driven by improved funding mix. Our deposit base increased by $9 billion and was 72% of our funding sources versus 64% a year ago. The cost of our deposit base is lower than our other funding sources. So the margin benefited from the shift in the funding mix to lower cost deposits.","The improvements noted above were partially offset by the impact of mix-shift due to continued strong growth and lower yielding Payment Solutions receivables. The plat\u2019s receivables have grown on average 15% compared to retail card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 10% to 11% range over the past year.","So overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our outlook for the year. Next, I\u2019ll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall, the credit environment remains favorable and we continue to see significant growth opportunities at attractive risk adjusted returns.","However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past two years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually over time. Our view on credit takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors.","In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.32% compared to 4.06% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.03% compared to 1.86% in the prior year.","The net charge-off rate was 4.62% compared to 4.23% last year. And as I noted earlier, net charge-offs for the year were 4.5%, in line with our outlook for the year. Lastly, the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables decreased 13 basis points from the third quarter, to 5.69%, due mainly to the seasonal build in receivables and was largely in line with our expectations. The reserve build reflects the growth in the portfolio and the normalization in net charge-offs.","In summary, while credit will normalize from here, it\u2019s important to reiterate that we\u2019re still operating in a pretty favorable environment. And the risk adjusted returns we\u2019re earning on the new accounts we\u2019re bringing on are still very attractive.","Moving to Slide 9, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at $918 million for the quarter, up 6% over the last year driven primarily by growth.","Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up $30 million, as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth in the business. This increase also reflects cost related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees as well as the replacement of certain services that were previously provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE.","Marketing and business development costs were up slightly, $2 million over the last year. Increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which help drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables was largely offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions which is reflected in loyalty program expense.","Information processing was up $5 million or 6% driven by continued IT investments, and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expense increased $12 million, primarily driven by growth.","The efficiency ratio was 31.6% for the quarter, approximately 240 basis points lower than last year, as the business continue to generate significant positive operating leverage due to the strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses.","Moving to Slide 10, I\u2019ll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as summarize our capital plans.","Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business.","Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily to our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 72% of our funding, significantly higher than the 64% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities.","Longer term, we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers. Our retention rate on our CDs in 2016 was 91%, which is up from 88% in the prior year.","In terms of our funding plan going forward, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix in 2017. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range and is now 17% of our funding. This is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization at between 15% to 20% of our total funding.","Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. While we did not do any issuance in the fourth quarter, we will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets and expect this to be 10% to 15% of our funding going forward. So overall, we feel very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources.","Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 17.2% CET1 under the transition rules and 17% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 15.9% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 100 basis points over the past year.","Total liquidity decreased slightly compared to the prior year to $20 billion, and includes $13.6 billion in cash and short-term treasuries, and an additional $6.7 billion in undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 22.5% of our total assets. This is down from 24.9% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity as I noted earlier. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.","During the quarter, we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased 238 million of common stock out of 952 million our board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to execute our share repurchase plan, subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions and required approvals.","Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We\u2019ve built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources, and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Next on Slide 11, I\u2019ll recap our 2016 performance versus the outlook we provided last January. Starting with loan receivables, our growth of 12% exceeded our outlook range of 7% to 9%. The growth in 2016 was driven by the strong value props on our cards, and our marketing strategies with our partners delivering strong organic growth. Our continued investments in mobile, innovation and data analytics capabilities are enhancing our ability to drive organic growth as well as win new programs.","Net interest margin was 16% for the year, which is better than the 15.5% range we provided back in January. Higher receivables yield, and a more optimal asset and funding mix were the major drivers for the outperformance. Our net charge-off rate of 4.5% was in line with our outlook of 4.3% to 4.5%. We did start to see net charge-offs normalize off the very favorable levels in 2015, and expect this to continue into 2017, which I will discuss in our outlook.","The efficiency ratio for the year was 31.1%, well below the 2015 level of 33.5% and our outlook of below 34%. Stronger revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses generated significant operating leverage in 2016. And lastly, we generated a return on assets of 2.7%, which was at the mid-point of our range for 2016.","The strong operating leverage we generated due to higher growth, improved net interest margin and expense control more than offset higher provision expense in 2016. So overall, we were pleased with the results of our financial performance in 2016.","Moving to our 2017 outlook on Slide 12, our macro assumptions for 2017 assume the fed tightens 25 basis points late this year, and a stable to slightly improving unemployment rate. Our outlook for receivables growth is in the 7% to 9%. We expect to continue to grow sales volume at two to three times broader retail sales. This outlook doesn\u2019t assume any significant new portfolio acquisitions or value propositions, and it\u2019s in line with our organic growth rates in the previous years.","We believe our margin will be in the 15.75% to 16% this year. While we expect to realize a modest benefit from the December rate increase, we expect this to be more than offset by the continued strong growth in Payment Solutions. If rates do increase during the year, we expect our slightly asset-sensitive position will provide a small benefit to our net interest income.","In terms of credit, we expect net charge-offs to further normalize into the 4.75% to 5% range in 2017. Our base plan class for net charge-offs to be just under the midpoint of the range. We have also evaluated scenarios with changes to portfolio mix, consumer trends, payment behaviors and recovery rates. And if they were to trend somewhat differently than we have planned, this would bring net charge-offs closer to the higher end of the range.","Regarding the loan loss reserve and coverage in 2017, we would expect the reserve to cover approximately 14 to 15 months of expected future net charge-offs, which should give you a way to think about the reserve builds throughout the year. We also need to consider how seasonality impacts reserve covers. For example, we typically see reserves as a percent of receivables increase 40 to 50 basis points from the fourth quarter to the first quarter, given the seasonal decline in receivables and we would expect the similar trend this year.","Moving to the efficiency ratio, for 2017 we expect to operate the business with an efficiency ratio of around 32%. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, this will be offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments, partially driven by the timing of the spend on some of those projects.","Our efficiency ratio continues to compare favorably to the industry. And we feel well-positioned to manage this going forward as we expect the business to generate positive operating leverage over the long term. And finally, we continue to expect to generate return on assets in the 2.5%-plus range in 2017.","Before I conclude, I wanted to reiterate our thinking around capital for 2017. We are planning to follow a very similar process to 2016. We will use the fed scenarios and assumptions due out in February and develop a capital plan that we\u2019ll review with our Board and our regulators in early April. And we hope to gain a position to announce our capital plans in the June-July timeframe.","While I can\u2019t be specific as to our capital plans at this point. We would expect to continue deploying capital through both dividends and share buybacks in addition to supporting growth.","And with that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll close with an overview of our strategic priorities. First, we will continue to execute across our three sales platforms. Building upon our capabilities in marketing, analytics, loyalty and mobile technology, we expect to continue increase in penetration at existing partners and we\u2019ll add new partners and programs.","Second, we will continue to expand our robust data, analytics and technology offerings, and will continue our innovative strategy on mobile wallet development for private-label credit cards.","Third, we will broaden our banking product suite to help increase loyalty, further diversify our funding sources and drive profitability. We will also leverage our expertise to explore opportunities to expand our core business, such as expanding our small business capabilities and growing proprietary networks and acceptance.","Fourth, we will continue to operate our business with a strong balance sheet and financial profile. We expect to support our business model with diverse and stable funding. We also expect to maintain strong capital and liquidity to support our operations, business growth, credit ratings and regulatory targets.","Finally, we will continue to leverage our strong capital position. Our capital priorities are first and foremost organic growth and program acquisitions. Second, capital returns through dividends and share repurchases. And lastly, M&A that helps us enhance our capabilities to support growth.","In closing, we accomplished a great deal this year and believe we are well positioned to continue to leverage our expertise, market position and innovative approach to digital platforms and analytics to grow our program, pursue opportunities and continue to deliver value to our partners, cardholders and shareholders.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session, so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible. I\u2019d like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call.","Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. We will now begin the Q&A session. [Operator Instructions] and we have our first question from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks and good morning. I guess the question I wanted to ask is around competition. Obviously, one of the key items that came out recently is the Chase\u2019s Amazon Card product, the enhancement they made for rewards. Could you just talk about what kind of implications you expect to have on your own growth for that product? And just in general, I guess, I was getting a lot of questions from people asking if this means that the outside banks that aren\u2019t in private-label are going to find their way into the space.","Also, just maybe if you could clarify, the online sales growth number, Margaret, that you mentioned, it seemed to have slowed a little sequentially. Could you just talk about that as well? Thanks.","Margaret Keane","So there was lot of questions there. So let me start with Amazon and Chase. So, first of all, both of our programs have actually sat side-by-side for the last 9 years. We have the private label program and we have the opportunity to offer promotional financing. So these two programs have been out there together the whole time.","It\u2019s not surprising that Amazon wanted to match the value props. We knew that that was going to happen. We still believe that, given the growth of Amazon and our partnership with Amazon, that we have plenty of room to continue to grow. We see this as still a very big opportunity for us, particularly because of our partnership with them and the fact that we do have the promotional financing for big ticket it actually gives us some other opportunity.","In terms of how we\u2019re looking at it in our 2017, I\u2019d just turn it over to Brian to kind of maybe comment on that.","Brian Doubles","Yes. I\u2019d just reiterate what Margaret said, I mean, the two products have coexisted for a long period of time. And for the most part the products appeal to different consumers. And so, we\u2019ve been able to grow the program very well over the years. That\u2019s still our expectation going forward. Anything that we expect to see there has been obviously included in the guidance, so we just gave it on receivables.","Margaret Keane","And then your question on kind of mobile and online, let me just give you a little flavor. So overall, you saw we continue to invest in digital. We rolled out SyPi in the fourth quarter, which we feel really good about. Our online sales were up 20% versus last year, which is still above the industry average, which is about 16%. I think one important metric is in our sales penetration for Retail Card. It totaled 20% of our sales, while the national average is about 8%. And we\u2019re now getting about 40% of our applications online.","So if you think about where we\u2019re going and particularly where mobile is going. We also see big growth in mobile, in that over 50 million of our apps have [come overly] [ph] since 2012. And that\u2019s growing at above 42% year-over-year. So a little off of what we were running at, but certainly a very strong metric and one that we feel very good about. And see lots of opportunity in this space to continue to really outperform what the industry is performing at.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Citigroup.","Donald Fandetti","Hi, good morning. Brian, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about any potential portfolio acquisitions. And also on the Cabela\u2019s deal Capital One ended up winning, it sounds like there is potentially some regulatory hurdles. They have to work through licenses. You guys were in there potentially as the cover bid. And I was just curious, if you think about a deal like that, I think one of the issues was that it was a bank.","When you buy a retail portfolio, do you have any restrictions if there is a bank involved and like how quickly would you be able to get that type of approval? If you could just kind of talk about that a bit.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure, Don. So why don\u2019t I start with the pipeline. I mean, we continue to see a very strong pipeline across all three of our platforms. As you know, we don\u2019t build that into our guidance. So the outlook for 2017 of 7% to 9% on receivables is really organic growth. That\u2019s really continuing to take tender share, grow penetration side of the existing retailers.","But we always hope to add programs throughout the year. We had a really strong year on new deals, new program wins. We feel very good about our competitive position in all three platforms. And so that expectation is that will continue through 2017. I think Cabela\u2019s, obviously - it\u2019s our practice not to comment on potential transactions. So there is really not a lot that I can add there unfortunately.","Donald Fandetti","Can you talk maybe a little bit about broadly when you look at a portfolio, if there is a bank, is that a consideration or is that a hurdle for you, I should say, even just generally?","Brian Doubles","Well, I think the - the consideration there is that if you\u2019re acquiring another charter it usually requires a more, I guess, regulatory approval or a non-objection potentially depending on what the charter is and who the acquiring bank is. And so I think that\u2019s certainly I think a consideration for anyone in the space as opposed to just if you\u2019re buying a portfolio without a charter.","Again not commenting specifically on any particular transaction, but acquiring charter tends to create a little bit more of a regulatory hurdle.","Donald Fandetti","Got it. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JP Morgan.","Richard Shane","Thanks, guys, for taking my question. When we think about the consumer\u2019s decision to use private-label versus general purpose, I think the decision is really driven by sort of balancing the utility of having available to borrow on a private-label that doesn\u2019t reduce general purpose of borrowing and the incentives of rewards. And what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of years is reward incentive has gone up a ton. Are you guys seeing any shift in terms of how consumers are using the private-label card? Is that value proposition between utility and incentive changing in any meaningful way?","Margaret Keane","Well, I would say that what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years is, obviously, greater penetration in our partners on private-label. And a lot of that is driven by the value props that we put out, the 5% on Amazon, the Walmart value prop, those types of value props are important to the consumer. I mean, I think one thing that consumers continuing to look for is either some form of cash back or reward points that they can go in and spend more. Most of our private-label rewards are really around driving that customer back into our partners.","So I would say that consumers are paying a lot more attention to the type of rewards they are getting. And they\u2019re really looking for some type of real financial benefit to really encourage them to spend more. And that something we continually research, we continually evaluate. We work with our partners to make sure we have fresh offers out there continually. And we continue to feel good about how we\u2019re positioned here and the work we do with our partners on the types of research we do in rolling out those types of programs.","Richard Shane","Well, it\u2019s interesting because if you think about the distortion we\u2019ve seen, it\u2019s really between the consumer and the issuer. The retailers\u2019 incentive to drive transactions toward private-label because of the lower transaction fee has been unchanged.","Margaret Keane","True. I\u2019d also say from the retailer, because of our RSAs that\u2019s a very important element in addition to the overall getting customers to use. But I think the other piece that\u2019s important to note in all our research, we know that if a customers using a private-label credit card in one of our retailers, they tend to be the retailer\u2019s best customer. So those are the customers that are much more loyal and spending more within that retailer. So it really is not just about saving interchange or cost, it\u2019s really about growing sales for the retailer.","And when a customer holds a private-label credit card, their basket tends to be bigger and they tend to make more trips to that particular retailer, whether it is in-store or online.","Richard Shane","Terrific. Thanks, and sorry for the cell-phone ringtone in the background. That was the old Hartford Whalers\u2019 theme song.","Brian Doubles","No problem, Rick.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Thanks, guys. You commented a little bit on the efficiency ratio. And you mentioned, we should expect some operating leverage [with that] [ph] you\u2019re making certain investments in the platform. Maybe you can give us a little bit more detail on the types of investments and the timing. And then a little deeper in that is, what part of the expense structure in terms of line items, where we will see those inflections?","Brian Doubles","Yeah, sure, John. So I think maybe just to frame it up, we should take a walk back through 2016. And in the last quarter\u2019s call, I indicated that growing revenues 13%, expense is only growing 5%, and driving 240 basis points improvement in the efficiency ratio wasn\u2019t exactly a reasonable expectation going forward. So I think there are a couple of things to think about in 2017. So first on the revenue side, our expectation is that revenue grows more closely in line with the three year average, so more in line with receivables growth than what we did in 2016.","And then on 2016 in particular, we ended up spending a little less on the strategic investments than we originally planned. And so, that drove part of the efficiency ratio benefit that we had in 2016. And it really is just driven by timing of some of the spend related to the projects. And now some of that spend is going to slip into 2017. So that\u2019s really the timing difference that we are talking about.","In terms of the areas that we are investing it\u2019s all the things that we talked about in the past. It\u2019s digital capabilities, mobile, online, analytics, and it\u2019s really investing in those things. It\u2019s helping us deliver this very strong growth in what is a relatively weak retail environment.","So when we look at the plan for 2017, we\u2019re absolutely driving operating leverage in the core business. However, it is our expectation that it will be offset by the incremental spend on the strategic projects just giving the timing dynamic that I just mentioned. Does that make sense?","John Hecht","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. Yeah. And then with respect to the NIM guidance, maybe you could break it down, how much do you expect the kind of NIM trends to be related to the rate environment versus, I guess, the contract prices versus what you are doing with your excess liquidity portfolio?","Brian Doubles","Yeah, sure. So I\u2019d say generally most of the drivers on NIM should be fairly stable. There is always a few puts and takes. First, we are slightly asset sensitive, so we would expect to see a modest improvement from the rate hike that we just got in December, and the increase in prime. But then we expect to have a couple of offsets. Last year, particularly in the second half of 2016, we had a pretty significant lift in receivable yields. We saw higher revolve, frankly came in better than we expected it to. And we think that that benefit will moderate a bit into 2017.","And then, one of the dynamics that we had all year-in 2016 was the really strong growth of Payment Solutions. We do expect that to continue. And the fact that those receivables come on at a lower yield than the portfolio average, that will give us some slight downward pressure on the margins.","And the last thing I would just point out is that just given where the yield curve is right now, any unsecure or secured issuance we do in 2017 is likely to be a little more expensive. So I would say, generally fairly stable on the margins for 2017 with some slight downward bias.","John Hecht","I appreciate the color. Thanks very much.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from David Ho with Deutsche Bank.","David Ho","Good morning. I just wanted to parse out some of the credit outlook commentary you provided. Specifically starting out with the charge-off rate guidance, how does that compare to your June guide of roughly 20 to 30 basis points kind of through the first-half of 2017. And now we\u2019re kind of looking towards more of 25 to 50 basis points higher for all of 2017. Is that really the mix or do you see just a little bit on the margin, a little more credenalization [ph] on the back half of maybe higher or more aggressive kind of growth on the part of consumer? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yeah, sure, so no real change from what we previously indicated. We expect to continue to see credit normalize over time. The backdrop is still favorable. We still feel good about where unemployment is, where jobs are, so the consumer is generally healthy. As I mentioned in the comments earlier, our base plan has this a little below the midpoint of the range. So that\u2019s right in line with kind of where we thought would be back in June for the full year 2017. We obviously look at other scenarios and other assumptions that could push us toward the higher end as well.","We look at things like portfolio mix and expected mix changes. We look at consumer trends and payment behaviors. And that\u2019s what really gave us that range of 4.75% to 5%.","We\u2019ve also assumed a relatively stable macro environment, so we didn\u2019t include any lift from job growth, wage growth. It\u2019s really based on more of a status quo economy. So I think importantly, look, overall we are still very comfortable operating at these levels. And we really like the risk adjusted returns on the accounts we\u2019re booking.","David Ho","Sure. And then, more specifically on the mix, are you still seeing some faster growth from stores with a slightly weaker customer mix? And maybe how much of that is being offset by kind of lower loss rate Dual Card growth?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. I mean, those are all included in the guidance obviously. As we talked about in the past, our underwriting is very customized and we underwrite differently based on platform, by program, but also by channel and by product. So for us is not a one size fits all approach. So you can maintain very consistent credit guidelines, which we have. But given that we underwrite to different loss rates across all those different dynamics, portfolio mix can play a factor. And we certainly included that in the guidance that we provided.","David Ho","Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Hi, good morning.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Could we talk a little bit about the Dual Card program and the expectations you have for expanding that? And how much of that is in the guidance that you provided in loan growth?","Margaret Keane","Sure. So we\u2019re always looking to expand Dual Card. It\u2019s been a great product for us in terms of where we are. We try to get it into all big programs. So we continue to look at ways to encourage our partners to deliver Dual Card. And, 19 of our 26 customers already - or partners already have a Dual Card. So it\u2019s definitely part of our strategy. It\u2019s definitely something we feel really good about. And we\u2019ll continue to work with our partners to grow those programs.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Okay. And then, separately\u2026","Brian Doubles","And then, talking specifically on your guidance question, we obviously build in the current trends that we\u2019re seeing on growth related to Dual Card. What we don\u2019t build in though typically are new Dual Card launches. So as Margaret said, we have Dual Card in 19 of the 26 programs. For the other seven we haven\u2019t assumed that we do any big Dual Card launches there. So that would be incremental if we\u2019re able to get one or two of those done this year.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Okay, got it. And then a follow-up question on just the outlook for tax reduction and how you would use that strategically in your business, you\u2019re obviously a [full freight payer] [ph] right now. And if there were to be any tax changes that would reduce that for you, how would you think about that in your competitive position?","Brian Doubles","Yes, now, it\u2019s a great question. Obviously, there are a lot of speculation going on right now. Typically, we don\u2019t spend money that we don\u2019t have. So I think we need to wait and see to see what kind of benefit we do realize on tax reform. Right now, we\u2019re funding the majority of the strategic projects that we\u2019ve identified. But obviously, we would take a look at that and see if there is maybe some more that we could do on that front to drive growth. I think, it would be the same things that we\u2019re investing in now. But maybe it just is we do a little bit more that.","We might invest a little bit more in promotions, value propositions. All things are going to continue to drive growth to make the business better. The key question I think is how does the competitive environment change under tax reform and we\u2019ll obviously have to react to that as well.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","And do your clients expect to get any of that tax improvement that you would generate for themselves? Would that be part of the discussion you think?","Brian Doubles","Well, I think that\u2019s going to be part of the discussion on all of this. Like I said, I think we\u2019re going to have to see how the competition reacts to this. And, I think to the extent that there is real savings here, we\u2019re going to have to react to the competitive reality of that. But I think that\u2019s we\u2019re really speculating now. I think first we have to see what tax reform looks like and then I think we have to see what competitors end up doing.","Betsy Lynn Graseck","Okay. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yes, thanks. So it looks like the loan growth guidance for 2017, again, it was biased to be conservative than last year. You guys came in 300 basis points above the high-end of your guidance. I guess my question is what kind of headwinds do you see the loan growth that would justify kind of a midpoint that\u2019s again kind of 400 basis points below your run rate for 2016.","Brian Doubles","Yes. Sure, Mark. So, look, obviously 2016 was a very strong year. We\u2019re really pleased with the growth that we\u2019re seeing across the portfolio. I think the headline growth numbers were good. When you break down and look at the customer level metrics, you see really good trends on purchase volume per active account was up 3%, the balances per account were up 5%. So these are all good indicators that the consumers are seeing real value on the cards. So I think generally we feel really good about how we\u2019re positioned here.","When we build the outlook for 2017, you have to remember that the 79% is an organic growth target. And if you go back over the past five years and you strip out the impact from new deals and portfolio acquisitions and new value props, organic growth tends to be in that 7% to 9% range. And that\u2019s typically what we build the plan around. It also assumes that we\u2019re still operating in this relatively weak retail environment that\u2019s growing around 2% to 3%.","So we didn\u2019t include any lift from potential wage growth or we didn\u2019t build in any material gains and consumer confidence. So given those dynamics and the growing balances at 7% to 9% with retail sales growing in the 2% range is a pretty good result. And, obviously, based on my earlier comments, we\u2019ve got a really strong pipeline of new deals. And we\u2019re working really hard to bring those on. Those would help us maybe be a little bit better than this.","And obviously, that\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to do, but we tend to build the plan around organic growth and don\u2019t include things that are uncertain or that we don\u2019t know about.","Mark DeVries","Okay. But just a follow-up on that point, I mean, I think BP - wasn\u2019t VP like your biggest contributor in organic growth and didn\u2019t that lap kind of in the first half of the year, so the 12% run rate you are at in the back half of the year is relatively close to a clean organic number, right?","Brian Doubles","Well, I don\u2019t know if I\u2019d call it, because again remember we strip out value proposition changes too when we think about that. So we had a very significant change to the value prop at Walmart, Amazon is largely in the comps now. But that\u2019s certainly giving us some lift in 2016. So we don\u2019t build those things in and then sometimes those can happen midyear and help the results quite a bit. But you\u2019re right on BP. We also brought on Mattress Firm, Guitar Center and some others that are in the past couple years.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Got it. Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thanks. Good morning. Margaret, I had a follow-up question for you on your earlier comments around the competitive reward dynamics that we\u2019re seeing. It seems to us like you guys are relatively more isolated from the rewards for dynamics that we\u2019re seeing in the general purpose space. Do you agree with that characterization? And do you think that puts Synchrony on a relative damage in anyway?","Margaret Keane","Well, I think - I would say, yes. And I think part of that is driven by the fact that when we think about value prop and rewards. It\u2019s really within the context of our partners. And if you really look at someone who would use our card consistently, they would save more money and get more benefits over time if they use their cards every time they go into our partner. So I think if you really looked at the richness of our rewards, they\u2019re actually better and the consumer can really get some real advantages there.","So I do think we are a bit outside of the big reward programs. And it really does come down to a consumer who has real brand loyalty to a particular partner, who sees the value that they\u2019re getting on their card and continually use that card and feel like they\u2019re really gaining some real advantage by the rewards that we put together for those particular programs.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s great. Thank you. Brian, I had a question for you on the - on your allowance for loan losses as a percentage of period-end receivables. Assuming that the credit environment remains unchanged from where it is today, would the year-over-year change in that ratio continue to rise gradually higher at the same trajectory that we\u2019ve been seeing as credit continues to normalize or would it flatten out at some point? I\u2019m not looking to kind of get you to commit to where the ratio is going to go, but we\u2019d just love to hear your just brought thoughts on the mechanics of how that works at this point in the cycle.","Brian Doubles","Yes, sure. I mean, obviously as charge-offs are normalizing, you would expect the reserve percentage on receivable to continue to increase. And the best way for you to model that I think is we\u2019d expect reserve coverage, and again, this is not how we book the reserve, but we would expect reserve coverage against future net charge-offs to be in that 14 to 15 months of coverage range. So I think if you take your charge-off forecast and you back into what the reserves will need to be to maintain that coverage ratio, that should give you a pretty good way to think about it.","So more specific to your question, as charge-offs start to level off, and we do expect normalization will level off at some point, when that happens you would expect coverage increases to level off as well. And you get to more of a steady state. Now, I can\u2019t give you a quarter as to when exactly that\u2019s going to happen, but at some point in the future and certainly post 2017 at some point, we would expect that to happen, and so those two should level off together.","Bill Carcache","That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Very helpful. Thank you.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey, good morning, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Brian, I guess, just on that last point I do think historically you talked about something around 4.75% to 5% being normal for charge-offs. And clearly you said you don\u2019t expect this to be the year where charge-offs inevitably level off. But do you still feel comfortable that that\u2019s the range where we should expect charge-offs to begin to level off?","Brian Doubles","Yes, right. I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve given a normalized charge-off level. We\u2019ve kind of given you annual guidance as we see things. And part of the reason for that is there is clearly a lot of variables that go into that. You kind of have to pick an economic scenario. You have to pick unemployment number, jobs, wage growth, confidence, all those things in order to provide that.","So we give you our best outlook for the next 12 months. We feel like we have a pretty good visibility around that. We\u2019ve done that for 2017. I think importantly, as you think about normalization, normalization assuming all else being equal, and you\u2019re still in this favorable environment, credit should - the credit trend should level off at some point. But again it\u2019s hard to pick a quarter in terms of when that is actually going to happen.","Ryan Nash","Got it. And maybe if I could ask a question on the RSA, clearly this past year was impacted by the large reserve builds. And now you\u2019re talking about going back to 4.4% to 4.5%, which was similar to 2015 levels now. Now, I think you didn\u2019t have any provision growth that year. So I\u2019m just trying to marry a couple of different things. The efficiency ratio is going up. We are saying charge-offs are going up and there is a potential that loan growth is decelerating.","So I\u2019m just trying to understand like why would be RSA be going up under that environment. Couldn\u2019t we infer that you can have - the provision growth is clearly going to slow or retailers getting a bigger share? And then I guess, you did comment that Payment Solutions could grow faster, which doesn\u2019t have RSA attached to it. I\u2019m just trying to think about all those different comments together and tying it to the RSA.","Brian Doubles","Yeah. So obviously, there is a lot of moving pieces here and we talked about it on the past. You have to factor in all aspects of the program. So to your point, margin, credit, operating expense, you\u2019ve got program mix, the deal structures are all different and have different tiers and you also have growth. So all of those things have to be factored in. And again I recognize it\u2019s difficult for you guys to model, that\u2019s why we tell you what we think it\u2019s going to be for the year.","And maybe one way to think about it, Ryan, is that, you alluded to 2015, so if you take 2015 for a second, just drop 2016 from a minute, we reported a 4.4% RSA in 2015. And then if you do a comparison to what we are guiding to for 2017, you will see that for 2017 our efficiency ratio is planned to be much better than it was in 2015 and the margins will also be better. And so you have those two dynamics offset with higher provisions. And that gets you back to a similar kind of RSA rate.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Greg Ketron","Hey, Vanessa, we have time for one more question.","Operator","Thank you. Our final question will come from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks. I guess, just a follow-up on the questions on Amazon. Would you be willing to just talk a little bit about what portion of the customers use that promotional financing, because I was interested by the comments, Brian, about the revolve rates going up, because I would imagine the customers that Chase might attract away would be people that might be more of convenience user type and perhaps not the ones that would be your core customer in any case?","Margaret Keane","Yes, I think, basically, we probably target different customer basis between the Chase program and ours. We don\u2019t really disclose what the percentage of people who take the value prop. But if you think about the products that Amazon sells, big ticket TVs, whatever, that\u2019s what you usually see us being offered as, as one of opportunities for the customer to go after.","I think the other maybe people think of prime customers as prime customers, and they\u2019re not necessarily all prime customers, right? So obviously, we\u2019ll go little deeper than Chase would go. So I think our target markets are slightly different so that\u2019s why in terms of how we think of the overall Amazon program, we still think that has plenty of opportunity for us to really sit side-by-side with Chase, what we\u2019ve been doing over the years. I think the real different here is the value props are now matched.","So we\u2019ll continue to watch and then see what the impact is. We knew about program before it was launched. It was built into our 2017 guidance. So we still - I mean, listen, it\u2019s a great program and we feel great about our partnership. And what we are doing with Amazon. There\u2019s still tons of opportunity there.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. And just a follow-up, I think the definition of organic growth that you used kind of surprised me, because it\u2019s actually more conservative than I would have thought. I mean most of - I think other companies generally would have considered value prop changes and other things like that as organic growth. Is there any way you could kind of just approximate what those value prop changes have benefited the growth rate in the last few years, like is it 1 point, is it 2 points?","Brian Doubles","So just to be clear on that, we absolutely build in any value props that we know about or that have been agreed to with our partners. So if we were sitting here today in January and we knew that in March or June we were going to rollout a new value prop on one of our programs, we would obviously build that into our plans and we\u2019d build that into the outlook. What we don\u2019t build in are things that are just being kind of discussed and are very preliminary at this point.","It\u2019s really hard to go back over time and we certainly tried internally. I am not going to give you percentage. But it\u2019s hard to strip out and say, okay, here\u2019s what purchase volume would have been if we were just doing weekly, monthly promotions versus an everyday value prop. We certainly have a view on that when we launched these things, but it\u2019s hard to go back over the past two or three years, and strip that out entirely for you. What I can tell you though is there - go ahead.","Moshe Orenbuch","I was just going to say, but there has been some upside to it over the last several\u2026","Brian Doubles","Absolutely, I mean, if you look at - think about the three big value props that we launched in last two years, Walmart 3-2-1 the most recent one, the Sam\u2019s Club value prop and Amazon. Those clearly helped our growth rates. And we\u2019d be really excited to continue to do that. We are in discussions with all of our partners on beefing up the value propositions on the cards. We just don\u2019t build in anything that we don\u2019t know about at this point.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks so much.","Brian Doubles","Yes.","Greg Ketron","Hey, thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial.

Good morning everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide a review of the quarter, and then Brian will give details on our financial results.","I'll begin on Slide 3, third quarter net earnings totaled 604 million or $0.73 per diluted share. We delivered strong growth in each of our sales platforms, driving double digit growth in loan receivables and net interest income this quarter.","We also grew purchase volume 8% over the third quarter of last year. Looking specifically at our online and mobile purchase volume, sales grew 26%. Our online and mobile sales growth has continued far outpace U.S. growth trends, which had been in the 15%. We remain focused on developing solutions to support this important sales channel.","Looking at asset quality metrics, 30-plus days delinquencies were 4.26%, compared to 4.02% last year and our net charge off rate was 4.38%, compared to 4.02% in the third quarter of last year. We continued our discipline on expenses which increased only 2% over the last year. The strong revenue growth and control over expenses helped generate positive operating leverage and drove our efficiency ratio down to 30.6% from 34.2% last year.","Our growth was supported by another quarter of strong deposit generation, which increased 9 billion or 23% to 50 billion this quarter. Deposits now comprise 71% of our funding sources. The number has been trending above our original target of 60% to 70%, but we plan to continue to drive deposit growth by focusing on competitive rates and outstanding customer service, as well as the build out of our product suite.","Our balance sheet remained strong with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 18.2% and liquid assets totaling 16 billion or 19% of total assets at quarter end. We were pleased to initiate our capital plan in the third quarter. This quarter we paid a dividend of $0.13 per share and repurchased shares totaling 238 million. We are also deploying capital through our strong balance sheet growth.","Organic growth is more significant driver of our performance and continues to be our biggest opportunity. This quarter we renewed several key partnerships, including TJX companies, our strong performing program and great partnership. Card holders can continue to access loyalty rewards, mobile account management and other exclusive benefits with cards which can be used at T.J Maxx, Marshalls, HomeGoods and Sierra Trading Post stores as well as through online.","We also extended our 17 year partnership with hhgregg, a leading specialty retail of home appliances, televisions, consumer electronics and home furnishings. Through our partnership, card holders will be able to continue to access special financing offers, in store and online deals, convenient online bill pay and other exclusive benefits when using their hhgregg card in their 220 stores.","And we renewed our partnership with Nationwide Marketing Group, North America\u2019s largest buying and marketing organization. They work besides thousands of appliance, furniture, electronics and other dealers to help them grow their business and we\u2019re happy to continue to provide consumer financing through this group.","We\u2019re also pleased to have renewed an important endorsement by the American Dental Association. Endorsements are an integral part to helping us to extend the reach of our CareCredit platform.","We also continue to sign new partnerships. We signed a long-term agreement with Nissan to introduce a new cobranded consumer credit program. The program will be offered to Nissan and Infiniti dealerships in the U.S. as well as online. It will provide Nissan and Infiniti credit card holders with office rewards and exclusive benefits.","In addition, we reached an agreement with At Home, a big box specialty retailer of home d\u00e9cor products, to introduce a new consumer financing program. At Home card holders will be able to take advantage of commercial and financing office on qualifying purchases, exclusive discounts, loyalty rewards and other benefits including mobile account servicing.","We launched a new program with The Container Store, The Container Store private label credit card offers financing options for the purchase of the retailers more than 11,000 products, customized variety of services and organization solutions.","We also launched a new program with the Google Store, which was announced in conjunction with Google\u2019s release of their new Pixel phone. We\u2019re partnered with Google to launch Google Store financing, where we provide financing for their new hardware products including the Pixel, Google Home, Daydream View VR headsets, Chromecast Ultra and Google Wi-Fi. We had a very strong program launch and are excited about the prospects of this new partnering program.","We remain focused on pursuing new profitable opportunities to grow our business. Although, organic growth remains our biggest opportunity and as such we\u2019re working closely with our partners to continue to deliver leading edge capabilities, value, increased penetration and to drive program growth.","Moving to Slide 4 which highlights the performance of our key growth metrics this quarter, loan receivables growth remained strong at 11%, primarily driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 7%. Interest and fees and on loans grew 12% over the third quarter of last year. During the quarter we continue to drive growth by delivering value to partners and card holders via attractive value propositions, promotional financing and marketing offers.","On the next slide, I\u2019ll discuss this quarter\u2019s performance drivers across our sales platforms. We continue to generate strong growth across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter as shown on Slide 5.","Retail Card delivered another quarter of strong results. Receivables growth of 11% was driven by purchase volume growth of 7% and average active account growth of 6%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Broad based growth across retail car partner programs continued in the third quarter.","As I noted earlier, we renewed TJX companies, a key partnership for us. We also signed two new relationships with Nissan and At Home and launched a new Google Store program during the quarter. Our long tenure relationships are an important part of our story. We\u2019re able to leverage the expertise we\u2019ve developed over the decades of running this business into a platform that attracts new important partners such as Nissan and Google.","Payment Solutions also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 14% was driven by purchase volume growth of 14% and average active account growth of 13%. Interest and fees on loans increased 14%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. The industries where we provide financing had positive growth in both purchase volume and receivables, with home furnishings, automotive products and power leading the way.","We renewed several Payment Solutions relationships this quarter including hhgregg and Nationwide Marketing Group. This quarter we also extended our relationship with Kawasaki Motors Corp, USA to continue providing consumer financing for power sports products distributed by KMC to a network of approximately 1,100 independent retailers. Qualifying buyers will have access to special financing options for Kawasaki products from Synchrony. And we also launched the new program with The Container Store during the quarter. VP usage continues to be strong across payment solutions, representing 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter.","CareCredit also delivered a strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was driven by purchase volume growth of 8% and average active account growth of 8%. Interest and fees on loans increased a strong 11%, primarily driven by the receivables growth. Receivables growth this quarter was again led by our dental and veterinary specialties.","In addition to the renewal of the key endorsement with the American Dental Association, we also announced program renewals with four prominent dental organizations. Extending the network and utility of our CareCredit card continues to be a primary area of focus. And our focus on card utility has helped drive the reuse rate of 52% of purchase volume in the quarter.","We\u2019re also focused on developing technology that streamlines and enhances the CareCredit experience. This quarter we introduced CareCredit Direct, a private and secure platform wherein patients can apply for financing privately at the Healthcare provider practice, get a credit decision while they\u2019re there and if approved, use their CareCredit card to pay for the services that day. Each platform delivered strong results and continued to develop, extend and deepen relationships and drive value to card holders.","I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Brian to provide the details on our results.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Margaret. I'll start on Slide 6 of the presentation. In the third quarter, the business earned $604 million of net income, which translates to $0.73 per diluted share in the quarter. We continued to deliver strong growth this quarter with purchase volume up 8%, receivables up 11%, and interest and fees on loans up 12%.","Average active accounts increased 7% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our card, which continue to resonate with consumers. We also see positive trends in average balances and spend, with growth and average balance per active account up 4%, compared to last year, and purchase volume per average active account increasing 1% over the last year.","The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables. The provision increased $284 million compared to last year. The increase is driven by higher reserve build and receivables growth. Regarding asset quality metrics, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and the net charge-off rate was 4.38%, compared to 4.02% last year.","Our allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 5.82%, compared to 5.31% last year. The asset quality metrics which I\u2019ll cover in more detail later reflects a gradual pace of normalization that we had highlighted last quarter. RSAs were up 34 million compared to last year. RSAs as a percentage of average receivables were 4.3% for the quarter, compared to 4.6% last year.","The lower RSA percentage compared to last year is due mainly to the retailers sharing and the incremental provision expense, which more than offset the increase in sharing from the year-over-year improvements on net interest margin and lower efficiency ratio.","We expect the RSA percentage on a full-year basis to trend towards the 4.2% to 4.3% range. Other income was flat versus last year. While interchange was at 19 million, driven by continued growth and auto store spending on our dual card, this was offset by a loyalty expense that increased by 23 million, primarily driven by new everyday value propositions. As a remainder the interchange and loyalty expense went back to the RSAs, so there was a partial offset on each of these items.","Other expenses increased 16 million or 2% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, strategic investments in our sales and deposit platforms and enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities. The efficiency ratio for the quarter was 30.6%, which was 362 basis point improvement over the prior year, driven by strong growth in the business and maintaining discipline on expenses. I'll cover the expense trends in more detail later. Overall, our performance drove a solid quarter, generating an ROA of 2.8%.","I'll move to Slide 7 and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 12%, driven by strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.27% for the quarter, up 30 basis points over the last year. As you look at the net interest margin compared to last year, there are few dynamics worth pointing out.","First, we benefited from a higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we previously deployed some excess liquidity to fully pay off the bank term loan facility in early April. We\u2019re also deploying liquidity to support our strong receivables growth. The yield on receivables increased 13 basis points to 21.58%, driven by slightly higher revolve rate compared to last year.","We typically see the revolve rate increase in the third quarter. We also benefited to a degree from the prime rate being higher compared to the prior year. These benefits more than offset the impact of the slight mix shift due to the continued strong growth and lower yield in Payment Solutions receivables. The platforms receivables have grown on average 15%, compared to Retail Card and CareCredit receivables that have grown in the 9% to 10% range over the past year.","The cost of funding was up 3 basis points to 1.85%, due mainly to an increase from higher short-term benchmark rates. Our deposit base increased 9 billion or 23% year-over-year. The cost of our deposit base is lower than alternative forms of funding such as wholesale funding and we're pleased with the progress we made growing our direct deposit platform and increasing the mix of funding coming from deposits. Deposits are 71% of our funding versus 63% last year.","As we look out to the fourth quarter, we typically see some seasonality in our margin and expect the net interest margin to decline back into the 15.9% range, due primarily to the seasonal buildup in receivables. Overall, we continue to be pleased with our margin performance, which has exceeded our guidance for the year.","Next, I'll cover our key credit trends on Slide 8. Overall the credit environment remains favorable and we continue to see significant growth opportunities and attractive risk adjusted returns. However, as we noted previously, we continue to anticipate a modest degree of normalization from the very low credit trends we experienced over the past three years. Given the healthy economic backdrop, we would expect the pace of this normalization to occur gradually overtime.","Our view takes into consideration factors such as portfolio mix, account maturation, consumer trends and payment behaviors. In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.26% compared to 4.02% last year, and 90-plus delinquencies were 1.89% compared to 1.73% in the prior year, both in line with the levels we've been operating at over the past three years.","The net charge-off rate was 4.38% compared to 4.02% last year, consistent with our expectations. The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables increased to 5.82% in the third quarter, which was largely in line with our expectation. The reserved bill reflects the growth in the portfolio, the normalization in net charge-offs as well as lower recovery pricing, which we believe is partly attributable to the new proposed regulations around third party collectors.","Part of the increasing credit cost is offset through our retailer share arrangements and is reflected in the decline of the RSAs as a percent of average receivables to 4.3% this quarter, compared to 4.6% last year. This is also reflected in our full year guidance for the RSAs, which is now 4.2% to 4.3%. Looking to the fourth quarter we typically see an uptick in net charge-offs and given the seasonal build in receivables, we expect to see a modest decline in the allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables.","However, given the normalization trends, this decline is likely to be smaller than it has been in the past three years. We continue to expect net charge-offs to be around 4.5% for 2016, which is in line with our guidance for the year. We\u2019ll provide a full year view on 2017 and conjunction with the outlook we\u2019ll provide in January.","So in summary, while credit will normalize from here, it's important to reiterate that we are still operating in a pretty favorable environment and the risk adjusted returns for earning on the new accounts we're bringing on are still very attractive.","Moving to Slide 9, I'll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall, expenses came in at 859 million for the quarter, a 2% increase over the last year and are primarily driven by growth of the business. Looking at the individual expense categories, employee costs were up 43 million as we have added employees over the past year in key areas to support the growth of the business.","This increase also reflects costs related to bringing certain third-party services in-house to be managed by our employees, as well as the replacement of certain services that were provided to us under our transition service agreement with GE. Professional fees were up 12 million; this is primarily driven by growth in the business and certain third-party services.","Marketing and business development costs were down 23 million, higher costs driven by increases in portfolio marketing campaigns and promotional offers, which helped drive the strong growth in purchase volume and receivables, were more than offset by redirecting some marketing spend into everyday value propositions, which is reflected in the loyalty program expense. Lastly, given our strong growth in deposits, we were able to reduce some of the marketing costs associated with that platform.","Information processing was up 10 million, driven by continued IT investments and the increase in transactions and purchase volume compared to last year. Other expenses down 26 million due to reduction in costs, which are no longer being billed to us by GE, as well as benefits derived from EMV in the form lower fraud expense.","The efficiency ratio was 30.6% for the quarter, 362 basis points lower than last year, as the business continued to generate significant positive operating leverage through strong revenue growth and maintaining discipline on expenses. Year-to-date the efficiency ratio was 31%, 236 basis points lower than the same period in 2015.","We expect the ratio to trend up in the fourth quarter from the third quarter level as we see seasonally higher marketing and volume related expenses during the holiday season, as well as continued spend on strategic investments. However, given the strong start to the year we do expect the ratio to be around 32% for the full year 2016, well below the guidance we provided in January.","Moving to Slide 10, I'll cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as summarize our capital plan. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable, attractive source of funding for the business.","Over the last year, we've grown our deposits by $9 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 71% of our funding, which is slightly higher than the top end of our target range of being 60% to 70% deposit funded. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital and mobile capabilities. Longer term we would expect to grow deposits more in line with our receivables growth.","Overall we\u2019re pleased with our ability to attract and retain our depositing customers. Our retention rate on our deposits has consistently been in the 88% to 89% range over the past couple of years. Funding through our securitization facilities has been fairly stable in the $12 billion to $14 billion range, and is now 18% of our funding. In September, we successfully issued just over $750 million in three-year fixed rate notes, this is consistent with our approach to maintain securitization between 15% to 20% of our total funding.","Our third-party debt now totals 11% of our funding sources and reflects the full prepayment of the bank term loan in early April. We will continue to be a regular issuer in the unsecured debt markets, and in August we did issue a total of $750 million in senior unsecured debt, 500 million in 10-year fixed rate notes and 200 million of floating rate notes that mature in November 2017. So a fairly active quarter on the issuance front, and overall, we feel very good about our access to a diverse set of funding sources.","Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 18.2% CET1 under the Basel III transition rules, and 17.9% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 16.7% on a fully phased-in basis last year, an increase of approximately 120 basis points over the past year.","Total liquidity increased to 24 billion, and includes 16.4 billion in cash and short-term treasuries, and an additional 7.1 billion in undrawn credit facilities. This gives us total available liquidity equal to 27% of our total assets. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach, and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.","During the quarter we paid a $0.13 common stock dividend per share and repurchased 238 million of common stock out of 952 million our board authorized for the four quarters ending June 30, 2017. We will continue to be opportunistic regarding share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors including any legal and regulatory restrictions in acquired approvals.","Overall we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We\u2019ve built a very strong balance sheet with diversified funding sources and strong capital and liquidity levels and we expect to continue deploying capital for growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","With that, I'll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I'll close with the summary of the quarter on Slide 11, and then we can begin the Q&A portion of the call. We delivered another quarter of strong operational performance across key areas of our business. We drove strong organic growth and renewed several key partnerships and signed and launched important new partnerships during the quarter and looking ahead, our pipeline remains strong. Supporting our growth is our fast growing online bank, which delivered another quarter of strong deposit generation, further strengthening our overall funding profile. Our capital and liquidity position also remained strong and we were pleased to commence the payment of a dividend and also repurchase shares during the quarter.","I'll now turn the call back to Greg to open up the Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I'd like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the investor relations team will be available after the call.","Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And thank you, we will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great thanks. Brian, your comments about the net interest margin kind of coming back into that level, I guess what struck by is it felt like the seasonal improvement was a little better than - both in yields and the margin a little better than normal. Anything - you mentioned the revolve rate, so does some of that stick as we go forward, I mean how should we think about that over the fourth quarter and into \u201817?","Brian Doubles","Yeah, I think most of you think about the fourth quarter typically receivable yields come down just for seasonality. So if you look back over the past few years and you look at the receivable yield from the third to the fourth, it generally comes down in the fourth quarter, given you\u2019re building a lot of receivables obviously for holiday and the fact that they don\u2019t generate finance for deal in the quarter. So it is really that seasonal trend that is driving the forecast in the fourth quarter, the other dynamics are relatively stable. I think if you look at margins more generally we have been very pleased all year with the margins and the way that they have performed. If you remember back in January we thought NIM was going to be around 15.5%. We kind of revised that guidance to 15.75%, something in that range after we saw the strong deposit growth that obviously is continuing and then we are able to improve the yield on liquidity portfolio and also really optimizing amount of liquidity that we are holding. So all those things all else being equal should continue to flow through and we think those will flow through to the fourth quarter, that's why we kind of guided to the - took the guidance up to 15.75% for the year to 15.90% in the fourth quarter which should put you around somewhere around 15.90% for the year. So overall I think we performed very well on our margins relative to what we thought back in January.","Moshe Orenbuch","Perfect that sounds great and just as a follow up, similarly just on the operating expenses I mean you had some extra expenses now with FDIC and yet your efficiency ratios still coming in better. It feels like that should continue unless there is other stuff that you would want to call out as we go over the next couple of quarters.","Brian Doubles","Yeah, we have been very pleased as well with the efficiency ratio all year really and we are 31% year-to-date, so we are well below the 34% that we indicated back in January. You we are obviously benefitting having very strong revenue growth of 12% year-to-date on the prior year. As you might expect and as we talked about in the past the efficiency ratio will come up in the fourth quarter. And we always spend more in marketing around holiday; we also tend to have more volume related expenses. But due to the strong start of the year in the fourth quarter trend even as we see it, we expect the efficiency ratio will be somewhere around 32% for the full year or so. Significantly better than what we thought back in January.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great, thanks very much.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you. Good morning. Maybe just hit on the yield again Brian if you don\u2019t mind. I think Moshe mentioned the year-over-year increase in the yield was better for teams even it is for being on seasonality there is some other component to it. Is it late fees maybe and should we expect that to continue as the delinquency rates remain relatively elevated?","Brian Doubles","Well I think you always get a little bit more in a revolve in the book when you see a slight uptick in delinquencies, we are seeing that receivable yields were up 13 basis points year over year or so. This is really the first quarter where we have seen that kind of revolve rate and the benefits from the revolve rates poke through the downward pressure we had, just given the really strong growth and payment solutions. So that\u2019s the trend we are talking about all year, payment solutions is growing faster than the rest of the portfolio, roughly 15% growth rates relative to 9 to 10 in care credit and retail card and that was pricing downward pressure on the margins but now we are seeing that high revolve rate kind of poke through and gave us about 13 basis point yield improvement year-over-year.","Sanjay Sakhrani","And is there anything more that can happen with the liquidity portfolio because I mean it seems like you can still optimize some on the yield side going forward?","Brian Doubles","There is probably a little bit there Sanjay, it is not going to be dramatic, I think we have got really nice job this year, using the excess liquidity from the strong deposit growth to pay down the bank term loan I think we feel good about what we have done year-to-date, we get more yield on the cash and securities that we are holding, but I would say anything additional is going to be pretty modest going forward.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. I do have a question on slide 8, specifically the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of period and receivables and so clearly the very strong loan growth that we have been seeing has been driving reserve building but in addition to that growth driven building we have had kind of the normalization affect also driving building and so we kind of go from the low of 5.12% allowance gradually rising to kind of 5.8. That credit normalization effect has also driven some building and so it is kind of as we extend the thinking of credit continuing to normalize over the next several quarter for modeling purposes, is that kind of reasonable to expect that we kind of move into kind of like a six handle and [ph] gradually as we get over the next several quarters until 2017 that that number continues to rise or does that kind of flatten out at some point that where normalization is kind of achieved just trying to get substrate to think about that.","Brian Doubles","Yeah, sure Bill. Let me just kind of break down the reserve billed in the quarter. So I would say generally the reserves came in very much in line with our expectations. If you remember we gave in a range of 5.7 to 5.8 in last quarter, we had a rate of 5.7% and this quarter we came in at 5.82%, so better than expected growth over big chunk of that reserve built in the quarter. I think just in the quarter and last 90 days we had 2.4 billion receivable. The recovery assumption that I mentioned earlier, that drove about 36 million of the build in the quarter, which is about 5 basis point of coverage. So if you adjust for that the coverage would have been around 5.77%. So right middle of that range that we provided and if you think about it is helpful just to breakdown the reserve build in the quarter a little bit and this is not just to be cleared, this is not how we calculate the reserve but it gives you way to think about the different pieces. So if you take that 2.4 billion on receivables growth in the quarter and you just take that at the old coverage rate of 5.7% that gives you built of about 135 million of the 221. Right and then you got the coverage rate increased by 12 basis points which is about 86 million. And if you break that down into two pieces you got the 36 million for the recovery pricing that I have mentioned and then you got about 50 million or about 7 basis points as really for that normalization effect that we are seeing in the book over the next 12 months. So hopefully that gives you some pieces on the way to think about it going forward.","Bill Carcache","Okay, that\u2019s really helpful, thank you. And then as a follow up I was hoping you could share your thoughts on I guess what - maybe just broadly speaking has been some very favorable commentary from a capital perspective on given the Feds decision to eliminate qualitative failures for financials that are not considered GSIFs [ph] and also other changes including RWA growth partial by that termination during, it is really abrasive scenario, that it would seem to certainly significant source of potential upside for any non-GSIFs with significant excess capital and including yourselves just hoping that maybe you could share a little bit on how you guys are thinking about that?","Brian Doubles","Yeah, sure Bill. First just a quick reminder of that again we are not fee card bank but obviously we are trying to follow very similar rule that are in place for financial institutions of our sides. Given that new proposals that are out there I think clearly positive development, I think the moment to put in place more reasonable expectations for banks of our size. So we are obviously pleased to see that. I think it is still early to tell how significant the impact maybe, most of the more meaningful proposals I think will be adopted after the 2017 cycle so I have to see kind of what gets finalized but clearly the removable, the qualitative test for smaller financial institutions I think that\u2019s helpful. The treatment of dividends clearly the RWA assumptions those are all helpful but it is really hard to assess an impact until some of these things get finalized but I think it directionally headed the right way for us.","Bill Carcache","Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi good morning.","Brian Doubles","Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Just two questions one on the recoveries, I just want to make sure I understand what is driving the decision to resource around that and then secondly just had a question you did a analytics activity how much do you feel like you need to invest from here, how much have you invested so far and how much you think you need to invest from here to really get to where you want to be on data analytics and talk a little bit about the revenues that you can generate of the back of it thanks.","Brian Doubles","Sure Betsy may I just cover the coverage quickly and then Margaret will do the data analytic. So the recovery assumptions as I just mentioned that were drove about $36 million of the reserve built which is about 5 coverage so in August we saw decline in the pricing we are getting on our recovery so obviously we built that in an assumption in the reserve model and we believe that pricing reflects some impact that is new regulation that are being proposed for third party collectors. The proposal will likely make it a little more difficult, little more expensive to collect and we believe that is influencing the pricing in the market. So as those rules get finalizing, collectors get a better sense of the impact here we may see additional impact on the pricing but as it is right now we put out best estimates based on what we are seeing in the market today.","Betsy Graseck","Okay thanks.","Margaret Keane","Yeah so on data analytics I take two things, one as we continue to work with more channels we know that we have to really get more sophisticated and real time in our analytics. We don\u2019t really disclose how much we stand but what I can tell you as we are working very hard this year to build out a service sophisticated platform where we are really looking at building out data and CRM capability that goes well beyond just data for growing but also from a productivity perspective and really enhancing the whole win to win experience from our customer from the time they apply for credit all the way through to servicing and we have a pretty big cross functional team working on number of initiatives around data analytics. I believe and I think as our partners continue to look at ways to create more loyalty with our customers this is going to be in an important element of what we can bring to our partners combining that with the digital experience that are customers or starting to go through in really that area is growing exponentially. So it is an important area, with mobile and data analytics together I think these are two big growth levers for us as we look to really help our partners grow with our customer.","Betsy Graseck","And it is growth in the form of productivity enhancement for you but also winning new business?","Margaret Keane","Yeah, it\u2019s both. It is really using data just the much more smarter at how you are running the entire business from your origination all the way through to servicing and really looking at ways to make that customer experience even more seamless and frictionless using data and then hopefully using the data in a way that allows us to get the next purchase to get a bigger basket to drive that loyalty back in and enhance the experience with our retailers as they go from channel to channel.","Betsy Graseck","Okay, awesome thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey. Good morning, guys.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Brian Doubles","Good morning Ryan.","Ryan Nash","May be I will start with the RSA loans I think I am sure they came in better and Brian reiterate the guidance of 420 to 430, just what I am looking clearly we are down call it four to twelve year to date and we are down at least 25 bps each quarter so just want to understand if we would end up on the low end of the range you would imply flat year-over-year relative to last year so I just wanted to say what is the specific fourth quarter this year given the factor we reserve built in, in your comments you said that we shouldn\u2019t expect the same seasonal decline I am just trying to understand the puts and takes of how we would get either not only in the range but also just to the bottom of the range on RSA?","Brian Doubles","Sure Ryan, I think the one thing that get missed when model RSA, one I think obviously seasonality piece of that but I also think that people tend to view it as an offset to credit in isolation and I think it is obviously includes much more than that and so if you look at your year-over-year I mean just talk about the quarter for the second we had obviously very growth, we had better margins fairly big improvement year-over-year, much better efficiency ratio and at least in terms of the margins and efficiency ratio we think that carries through to the fourth quarter but for the seasonal elements that I mentioned earlier and so all of those positive dynamics in the business push the RSA higher. Right and then those improvements in the quarter and our expectations going forward there is going to be an offset there for the incremental provision and so I think you got to carry some of the real positives through in the fourth quarter and then obviously those push the RSA higher offset by what we are expecting on provision.","Ryan Nash","Got it and maybe I feel in different direction that\u2019s okay maybe we could talk about loan growth it is obviously coming in I take much higher than your guidance from earlier in the year, can you just talk about how much is coming from new customers and how much is coming from increased penetration rates and maybe in retail card can you give us a sense of maybe where you are in penetration across the range of merchants and how much improvement in penetration you are making, where do you think you can get to over time?","Brian Doubles","Sure Ryan there is a lot in there so just remind me if I missed something but I think generally we have been very pleased with the growth that we had all year. We have got receivables growth of 11%, we guided early in the year to 7 to 9. So we are obviously tracking well ahead of the guidance we have put out there in January. And when you look at the underlying growth drivers they are all pretty strong. You look at purchase volume per average active account was up, average balance per active account were up, we really measure as oppose to new accounts, what is really more important measure for us is active account. With private label and dual card you are really trying to move that more towards the top of all that card [ph] and get that usage and get that repeat purchases and so if you look at last two or three years and just compare that to average active account growth in last few quarters were up 7%. That growth has accelerated which is really positive dynamic for us, so I think there is really good evidence, good indicators of consumers are spending more, they are seeing real value in our card, the things we have done around the value propositions.","In Amazon, in Wal-Mart, we just announced another one at Guitar Center, those are really paying off. And then if you look at some of the additional things that we track and talk to you about online and mobile were up 26% in the quarter that compares to about 15% for the industry, the reuse that we are getting in care credit was up year-over-year 52% versus 50% year ago and we are bringing on new partners. We are bringing on new partners I would say the majority of those are start-up programs; those aren\u2019t really influencing the growth that we had so far year to date. And so to the second part of your question, most of the growth is really organic growth, it is driving that increased penetration. That is something that obviously tracks by program, it is how we measure our teams, that\u2019s all we focus on that\u2019s the only way to really grow 11% in a retail environment that\u2019s growing 2% to 3% and that\u2019s been pretty consistent and our growth rates have been pretty consistent over the past five years. So I think we feel really good about overall the fundamentals that we are seeing on growth. Did I miss any part of your question?","Ryan Nash","No, I think you answered almost thanks, thanks for taking my question.","Brian Doubles","Great thanks Ryan.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much, I know there has been lot of discussion but I just want to go back to one item and maybe I didn\u2019t fully understand but as I look at the yield on cards had a I guess about 60 basis point delta sequentially and I am wondering if there is any pricing activity associated with that change.","Brian Doubles","No, we haven\u2019t really made any pricing changes, really as the factors that I indicated we got a little more revolved but if you go back and look at prior periods there is always the seasonal increase from the second quarter to the third quarter. it is maybe a little bit more outside this time but that\u2019s really the driver and then we are getting a slight impact from a slight benefit from the increase in the prime rates, you have seen a little bit of that in the quarter as well.","Eric Wasserstrom","Got it, it was more than magnitude that was done, that I was curious about and then maybe just looking at purchase volumes, they did decline just a bit sequentially in retail and care credits, any trend to underscore there?","Brian Doubles","I don\u2019t think so, there is not always the perfect corollary between purchase volume and receivables you saw that as well in the first quarter when the purchase volume far outpace receivables. And I think as we indicated then this quarter we are comparing against the full quarter of BP and we are also comparing against the Amazon launch of 5% off so those are both factors when you look at purchase volume. I think more importantly receivables grow 11%, given what we are seeing in the mix or revolvers in the book which is great for us, that really drives the majority of our earnings and you are seeing that comparing interesting fees.","Eric Wasserstrom","Thanks very much.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yeah. Thanks. Brian you just indicated you are seeing very good response particularly at Amazon and Wal-Mart, but something little bit more specific without identifying one in particular as to what kind of improvement you are seeing in tender share at this point from the enhanced rewards?","Brian Doubles","I obviously can't be specific on either program but I would say in both cases they are performing better than our expectations. And I would price modestly better than our expectations only because we really know how to model this, we did 5% off that loans [ph] I think more than five year ago. So we have got really good data in analytics around value propositions particularly really attractive ones like 5% off, 531 in cents [ph] and we know what to expect in terms of transactors, revolvers what we expect to see from tender shift what kind of spend we expect on the card, what kind of payment behaviors and so. We had a pretty good view on what we thought both of those would - how both of those would perform and I would say we are ahead of our expectations on both.","Mark DeVries","Okay great and for the online retailers that you have, how many of them have the option like they have got in Amazon where the private level card becomes top of wallet by default and for those that don\u2019t do that there is an opportunity to kind of move into that and really drives better tender share?","Margaret Keane","Yeah, that\u2019s definitely is, all of them have the option to do it even retails are not fully online. So to have that check out is really golden and it really comes down to kind of philosophy within the retailer in terms of someone have a choice and others it is just really around getting the prioritization of getting that particular element into their system to get in place. So it is something that we put together what we call our digital mobile, online playbook for retailers and this is something that we talk a lot about. So it is a big opportunity for us as we move forward and continue to work but I would say is on the mobile world in general and online world in general there is a lot higher engagement across all our partners right now in this particular area as they are all really coming to terms of the fact that they have to be best in class. So we are spending a tremendous amount of time and effort, really working with our partners across all three pipelines to really make that happen.","Mark DeVries","Okay, thanks.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question comes from David Scharf with JMP Securities.","David Scharf","Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. First, wonder if I just get back to the recovery side as it is impacting the allowance forecast in collections. Can you expand a little more specifically on just how the proposed collection rates that are being revised, impact your efforts and whether that is likely to result based on new collection practices and to little more early stage in DQ that doesn\u2019t quite roll in or some of the change practices likely to impact more your latter stage caring efforts but just a little more specificity on its cost centre and other efforts just what has to be quantified?","Brian Doubles","Right now these are proposals and these proposals for new regulations around third party collectors. Obviously we sell a portion of our charge off to third parties and we believe that pricing that we are seeing in the market right now is somewhat influenced by these new proposal. So the proposal includes things like more documentation, more work for the third parties to substantiate the debt at the each stages for the collection process, reduce contact other restrictions things like that, additional disclosures and so, lot of these things aren't finalized at this point but I think people are anticipating that at a minimum it is going to be little more difficult, little more expensive based on these new proposals and they are building that into their pricing. So as we started to see that right around in the August time frame, we felt that in the reserve model and that is driving, what I would call relatively modest impact of five basis points on the coverage.","David Scharf","Got it and along those lines I know that the two largest debt buyers both public after a couple of years of commenting of elevated pricing and not much supply growth in the US, just a last couple of quarters seems to have been indicating that pricing has been leveling off and so forth. Are you finding that the pricing as a percentage of principal balance that you are able to sell charge offs for are declining or they pretty much holding firm with the historically more elevated prices that you saw earlier in the year.","Brian Doubles","Yeah, we did see a decline in the pricing and we think a part of that is driven by this dynamic that I just described on some of these anticipations of some of these new regulations that are coming in. We don\u2019t get obviously complete transparency at the end of the pricing. So this is what we believe at least partly influencing what we are seeing in the market.","David Scharf","Got it, very helpful, thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","And thank you. Our next question is from James Friedman with Susquehanna.","James Friedman","Hi. Thanks, I had just two quick questions. Margaret, in the past year you had made some comments about the digital channels, I was wondering if you could help us to quantify those that are even quantitatively like how much is that driver of the growth of the company? And then Brian I was wondering if you could elaborate and you talk about this a bit, but the loyalty payment at 145 million if you look at the new absolute [ph] it is the higher that we have seen and then as a percentage of the purchase volume it was also high so anything that you could share on the trajectory that would be helpful, so one on digital and two on loyalty. Thank you.","Margaret Keane","I would say the bulk of sales are still done predominantly in store, but what I would say is that it is definitively shifting and each quarter we see incremental growth on online and digital and as we stated our online sales were up 26% over last year and that continues to grow every single quarter. About a third of our applications occur digitally. We received about 12 million mobile applications since we launched in 2012, that\u2019s grown at about 80% year-over-year so that\u2019s a big growth channel for us that I think you would continue to see expanding. And we are seeing faster growth in the industry so I think the important part of digital and online is really our ability to continue to integrate with our partners and so one of the things we are really working hard on now obviously we have done [indiscernible] those things we have digital cards on our own. What we are seeing now is more and more retailers are creating their own apps and we are really trying to work to be in that app so that is really seamless and frictionless process for the customers they are shopping around on a mobile app of a particular retailer. So I think you are going to see as focusing even more on that retailers come to us and ask to really engage at a much higher level, that\u2019s my point earlier, I think this isn\u2019t a little bit of a shift in terms of how retailers are even thinking about mobiles and putting a lot more efforts there, that\u2019s why we are very highly engaged right now across all three platforms really.","James Friedman","Thank you.","Brian Doubles","And then on your loyalty question, that\u2019s a trend that we have continued to see all year. We have obviously introduced many new value propositions over the past year. We introduced the Sam's Club 5-3-1, Amazon Prime 5%, we have got new programs at Chevron and BP, new value proportion at Wal-Mart that three two one, so all of those are obviously influencing both the interchange and the loyalty lines as you see. Generally more loyalties is a good thing, it means we have grown our receivables; we are generating finance charge revenue. The lines also run back to the RSAs there is an offset there and if you are looking at just a relationship between royalty and interchange the one thing I would just point out is this is very different than purpose card, given we have significant value propositions like Amazon where we don\u2019t charge interchange but we still offer very attractive value proposition. We would expect to see loyalty increase a percentage of interchange going forward. That\u2019s really we don\u2019t look at those lines and isolation we really measure on kind of in the context of the overall deal structure. So it is like if we have the opportunity to launch a better value proposition and it is going to drive more usage on the card, generate strong receivables growth that\u2019s a good thing for us, it is a good think for our partners and it really comes down to the shared economic model.","James Friedman","Thanks for taking my questions.","Brian Doubles","Sure.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Arren Cyganovich with D. A. Davidson.","Arren Cyganovich","Thanks. With respect to the efficiency improvements that you have seen, maybe you could talk a little bit about the potential for that to continue to go down or you use some of the savings to reinvest in digital and maybe online checking those kinds of things working that operating efficiency actually go to over time.","Brian Doubles","Yeah, this has been a very strong year to date performance I mean it is not just a temper expectation, probably not a realistic expectation that we are in a grow revenue in 12% and expense too. So we are very pleased with how we performed year to date. Well obviously we have been given an outlook for 2017, we do the call in January, but I think the important thing is we are very focused on driving operating leverage. This is a scalable business, now that the infrastructure cost are in the run rate, we would expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage over the long run. We are always working to get more efficient across the business, we always start the year with a bunch of productivity initiatives, cutting out waste in the business, getting more efficient, moving more online off the paper and we use those savings that we generate there primarily to invest in long terms growth ideas, so things like mobile, data analytics, CRM, but even taking those investments into account, we\u2019d still - our goal would be to continue to generate operating leverage going forward.","Arren Cyganovich","Great, that\u2019s helpful. And then just back to the allowance, you\u2019d mentioned that the seasonality that you typically see in the fourth quarter causes the allowance for loan losses to relative receivables to fall a little bit. It looks like it\u2019s been around 18 and 19 basis points in recent years. Can you give a little bit further kind of pinpoint in terms of how much that reduction will be less during the fourth quarter this year?","Brian Doubles","I mean it\u2019s hard to get specific, it will be - we still expect a reduction, so more than zero, but less than 19. And we\u2019re talking about basis points, so it\u2019s a big estimate that we make at the end of the year given the seasonal growth. So I can\u2019t get more specific. We do expect it to come down, but just not quite as much as it has in the last three years. You have to remember, in the last three years, we were in an improving environment, so whatever build we\u2019re recording in the fourth quarter was at least partially offset by improved performance and now it\u2019ll be more reflective of growth and the normalization trends that we\u2019re seeing in the portfolio.","Arren Cyganovich","Got it. Okay, thank you.","Greg Ketron","We have time for one more question.","Operator","Well, thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies","John Hecht","Thanks very much guys. Margaret, you\u2019ve given a lot of information about the online, the trends of the business, I\u2019m wondering if you could just - if you get down to the customer level, can you guys highlight any - whether it\u2019s spend trends, borrow trends or credit trends, is there any difference between an online customer and a store based customer?","Margaret Keane","No, the online spend and the trends are the same. I\u2019d say, the one area that we continue to ensure we\u2019re focused on is really ensuring the authentication of the customer. So I think that\u2019s where pro-rates might be slightly lower just because you\u2019re dealing with an online channel versus an in-store experience. But that\u2019s a great area where we\u2019re spending a lot of time and investing in new technology to really make sure we\u2019re best in class. So that would be the only I think fundamental difference.","John Hecht","Okay, that\u2019s good color, thanks. And then last question, I\u2019m wondering if you could just remind us of your partner maturity profile as we go into 2017?","Brian Doubles","Yeah, I think we\u2019ll have that in our investor deck that will come out in a few days. But there\u2019s really - you\u2019ll see from that there\u2019s really nothing material contractually kind of the 2019, 2020 timeframe.","John Hecht","Great, thanks guys.","Brian Doubles","Yeah, thank you.","Greg Ketron","Hey, thanks everyone for joining us on the conference call this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The investor relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day.","Operator","And thank you ladies and gentlemen.

Please note that this conference is being recorded.","I will now turn the call over to Mr. Greg Ketron, Director of Investor Relations. Sir, you may begin.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Operator. Good morning, everyone. And welcome to our quarterly earnings conference call. Thanks for joining us.","In addition to today\u2019s press release, we have provided a presentation that covers the topics we plan to address during our call. The press release, detailed financial schedules and presentation are available on our website, synchronyfinancial.com. This information can be accessed by going to the Investor Relations section of the website.","Before we get started, I want to remind you that our comments today will include forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results could differ materially. We list the factors that might cause actual results to differ materially in our SEC filings, which are available on our website.","During the call, we will refer to non-GAAP financial measures in discussing the company\u2019s performance.

After we complete the presentation, we will open the call up for questions.","Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Greg. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us. During the call today, I will provide an overview of the quarter and then Brian will give details on our financial results.","I\u2019ll begin on slide three. For the third quarter net earnings totaled $555 million or $0.70 per diluted share. We continue to generate strong growth in several key areas of our business. Loan receivables were up 9%, which helped to drive strong net interest income growth of 11% during the quarter, consistent with our expectations organic growth helped to drive this performance and remains a top priority for our business. Additionally, purchase volume and average active accounts both increased 4% in the third quarter. These metrics are also highlighted on slide four of today\u2019s presentation.","Moving to credit quality, net charge-offs were 4.95% this quarter compared to 4.39% last year, provision for loan losses increased 33% driven by credit normalization and growth. Brian will provide more details on credit later in the call.","The efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter versus 30.6% last year as we continue to generate positive operating leverage. Our deposit base comprises a significant portion of our funding, 73% in the third quarter. As such, we remain focused on continuing to generate deposit growth.","In the third quarter, deposits were up nearly $5 billion over the prior year or 9% to $54 billion. Competitive rates and customer service should help us to drive further deposit growth, and we expect for that growth to generally trend in line with our receivables growth.","Regarding capital and liquidity, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was 17.3% and liquid assets totaled $16 billion or 18% of total assets at quarter end. During the quarter, we paid a $0.15 dividend per share and repurchased $390 million of our common stock.","Looking at the business highlights, we renewed several partnerships this quarter, including Yamaha, BrandsMart U.S.A., Nautilus, Mars Petcare and Evine. We continue to seek new partnerships to augment our strong organic growth.","During the quarter we launched new programs with At Home, a big-box specialty retailer of home decor products and Zulily, an e-commerce retailer. Furthermore, with the launch of Zulily, our QVC cardholders now enjoy expanded card utility as they are also able to use their QVC cards to make Zulily purchases.","We also launched a new value proposition at PayPal that offers cardholders 2% cash back on their online and in-store purchases wherever MasterCard is accepted, and to make the card convenient and simple to use, all accounts are automatically added to members\u2019 PayPal Wallet and cash rewards are redeemed directly to PayPal balances.","We recently announced the rollout of our new CareCredit Dual Card, the CareCredit Rewards MasterCard. The card is being offered as an upgrade to select cardholders among our 10 million plus nationwide cardholder base. This new card combines the promotional credit capabilities of the standard CareCredit card with the added convenience of MasterCard acceptance.","The CareCredit Rewards MasterCard remains focused on health, wellness and personal care, while offering cardholders the ability to earn points for all purchases, including CareCredit network and general purchases.","Turning to slide five, I\u2019ll spend a few moments on our sales platform performance. We continued to deliver growth across all three of our sales platforms in the third quarter. In Retail Card, we grew loan receivables 9% over last year, reflecting broad-based growth across our partner programs. Purchase volume grew 4% and average active account growth was 3%. Interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth.","As I noted earlier, we had another active quarter in our Retail Card sales platform with the renewal of our Evine partnership, the launch of our At Home and Zulily programs, and the rollout of our new value proposition at PayPal. We continue to leverage our strong Retail Card foundation and make investments to drive organic growth and attract profitable new programs.","Payment Solutions also delivered a solid quarter. Broad-based growth across the sales platform with particular strength in home furnishings and automotive products resulted in loan receivables growth of 9%. Purchase volume grew 6%, excluding the impact from the loss of sales due to the HHGregg bankruptcy.","Average active accounts were up 9%, and interest and fees on loans increased 11%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth. We are pleased to have renewed several key Payment Solutions programs during the quarter, including Yamaha, BrandsMart U.S.A. and Nautilus, and we continue to enhance our Synchrony Car Care program, recently adding additional utility to nearly 3 million cardholders with the addition of Mavis Discount Tire to the Synchrony Car Care network. Payment Solutions reuse rates represented 26% of purchase volume in the third quarter.","CareCredit also delivered another strong quarter. Receivables growth of 10% was led by our dental and veterinary specialties. Purchase volume and average active accounts were both up 9%. Interest and fees on loans also increased 9%, primarily driven by the loan receivables growth.","We recently renewed our partnership with Mars Petcare, a global leader in pet care. We also entered the durable medical equipment market with new multiyear partnership with several personal mobility companies. This new market aligns well with our objective of helping people pay for care when they need it.","And as I outlined earlier, we recently launched our new CareCredit Dual Card, further expanding the utility and convenience of the card. We will continue to seek ways to expand the utility of our CareCredit Card.","Our network expansion and increased card utility has helped drive reuse, which represented 54% of purchase volume in the third quarter. Our sales platform delivered solid results and continue to develop, extend and deepen relationships, while providing innovative value-added solutions for our partners and cardholders.","I\u2019ll now turn the call to Brian to provide the details on our results.","Brian Doubles","Thanks, Margaret. I\u2019ll start on slide six of the presentation. In the second quarter Synchrony earned $555 million of net income, which translates to $0.70 per diluted share. We continued to deliver strong growth with loan receivables up 9% and interest and fees on loan receivables up 11% over last year. Overall, we\u2019re pleased with the growth we generated across the business.","Purchase volume grew 4% over last year. The slower growth compared to recent quarters was due to a few factors. The underwriting refinements we have noted previously, impact from the hurricanes during the quarter and the HHGregg bankruptcy. Given some of these items are short-term in nature, we would expect the impact to moderate in future quarters.","We had another solid quarter in average active accounts growth, which increased 4% year-over-year driven by the strong value propositions and promotional offers on our cards that continue to resonate with consumers.","The positive trends continued in average balances with growth and average balance per average active account up 6% compared to last year. The interest and fee income growth was driven primarily by the growth in receivables.","RSAs increased 6%, while we share the strong topline growth and positive operating leverage generated in the quarter, this was partly offset by higher incremental provision expense, RSAs as a percentage of average receivables was 4.2% for the quarter, down from 4.3% last year and in line with our expectations. For the year we still think RSAs will run near 4%.","The provision for loan loss increased 33% over last year driven by credit normalization and growth. The reserve build in the quarter was $360 million, which included the impact from areas affected by the recent hurricanes and a slight reduction in expected recovery sales going forward.","Adjusting for those items, the reserve build was largely in line with the previous two quarters and the expectations we laid out earlier in the year. I will cover asset quality metrics in more detail when we review slide eight later.","Other income was $8 million lower than the prior year. While interchange was up $10 million driven by continued growth in out-of-store spending on our Dual Card, this was offset by loyalty expense that increased by $23 million, primarily driven by everyday value propositions.","As a reminder, the interchange and loyalty expense run back through the RSAs, so there is a partial offset on each of these items. As we noted last quarter, we expect loyalty program expense as a percent of interchange revenue to trend near 100% with some quarterly fluctuation.","Other expenses increased $99 million or 12% versus last year. We continue to expect expenses going forward to be largely driven by growth, including strategic investments in our sales platforms, in our direct deposit program, as well as enhancements to our digital and mobile capabilities.","Lastly, the efficiency ratio was 30.4% for the quarter, compared to 30.6% last year and year-to-date the ratio is 30.3%, around a 70 basis point improvement over the 31% ratio year-to-date last year. The business continues to generate a significant degree of positive operating leverage.","I\u2019ll move to slide seven and cover our net interest income and margin trends. Net interest income was up 11% driven by the continued strong loan receivables growth. The net interest margin was 16.74%, up 40 basis points over last year.","While we generally see margin performance improvement in the third quarter due to a higher revolve rate, the margin performed better than expected driven by a few factors. First, we benefited from a slightly higher mix of receivables versus liquidity on average compared to last year, as we continue to optimize the amount of liquidity we\u2019re holding and have deployed excess liquidity to support our strong receivables growth.","The yield on receivables was up 14 basis points compared to the prior year. The revolve rate increased slightly compared to the prior year and we received a modest benefit from the increases in the prime rate over the past year. Funding costs increased 8 basis points driven by higher rates in our interest-bearing liabilities, primarily due to higher benchmark rates.","Since the fed started tightening, we had benefited as our yield on earning assets have outpaced the increase in funding cost, leading to the margin outperforming our expectations. Part of this benefit can be attributed to lower deposit rate betas than we were expecting through the first 100 basis points of tightening. We did see deposit rates move more in the last tightening, and we believe if rates continue to rise our deposit betas will increase to keep pace with future rate and deposit market increases.","We also expect to see the normal seasonal decline in yield in the fourth quarter given the build in receivables during holiday season. This has been as much as 50 basis points to 60 basis points historically. As a result, we expect the net interest margin to trend closer to 16.25% in the fourth quarter, still well above our original outlook.","Next, I will cover our key credit trends on slide eight. As we have noted on our previous calls, credit began to normalize in mid-2016 and we have expected this normalization to occur over time driven by number of factors, including portfolio and channel mix, account maturation and seasoning, and consumer and payment behaviors.","As a result, we have needed to increase the level of reserve builds over the last quarters and as expected, this continued during the third quarter. But going forward, we believe the receive builds needed will be lower as the pace of credit normalization slows, assuming the current economic trends continue.","In terms of the specific dynamics in the quarter, I will start with the delinquency trends, 30-plus delinquencies were 4.8%, compared to 4.26% last year and 90-plus delinquencies were 2.2% versus 1.89% last year.","Moving on to net charge-offs, the net charge-off rate was 4.95%, compared to 4.39% last year. The largest contributing factor to the increase in NCOs continues to be normalization. Given what we\u2019ve seen so far, we continue to expect NCOs to be in the low 5% range for 2017, however maybe at the higher end of the range depending on the impact from the hurricanes. It\u2019s important to note that we do see a fairly significant seasonal impact that typically results in higher NCO levels in the fourth quarter.","The allowance for loan losses as a percent of receivables was 6.97% and the reserve build from the second quarter was $360 million. As I noted earlier, this included the impact related to areas affected by the recent hurricanes and a slight reduction in expected recovery sales going forward. Adjusting for those items, the reserve build was largely in line with the previous two quarters and the expectations we laid out early in the year.","Looking forward based on what we are see across the portfolio and assuming economic conditions are stable, our expectation continues to be a loss rate in the low-to-mid 5% range for 2018, with losses trending somewhat higher into the first half of \u201818, then starting to level off in the second half of the year. This is consistent with what we noted last quarter.","Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds will transition to be more growth driven, given our expectation that losses begin to level off in the second half of \u201818. We believe the reserve build in the fourth quarter will begin to reflect this and we expect the build to be in the $275 million range.","I\u2019d also like to provide an update on underwriting and vintage performance, which continues to trend in line with expectations. As you remember, we started making refinements to our underwriting in the second half of 2016 and we continue to see the positive impact of those changes.","Additionally, we have continued to make incremental underwriting changes throughout the year and the early data suggest that the 2017 vintage is performing better than the second half of \u201816 and more in line with our 2015 vintage.","In summary, while credit continues to normalize from here, we expect the pace of change and impact on our results will moderate as we move into 2018, assuming stable economic conditions. We continue to see very good opportunities for continued growth at attractive risk-adjusted returns.","Moving to slide nine, I\u2019ll cover our expenses for the quarter. Overall expenses came in at $958 million, up 12% over last year. Expenses continue to be primarily driven by growth. As I noted earlier, the efficiency ratio was 30.3% year-to-date, around a 70-basis-point improvement over last year, as we continue to drive operating leverage in the core business, while continuing to fund our strategic investments.","Moving to slide 10, I will cover our funding sources, capital and liquidity position, as well as continued execution of the capital plan we announced in May. Looking at our funding profile first, one of the primary drivers of our funding strategy has been the continued strong growth of our deposit base. We continue to view this as a stable attractive source of funding for the business.","Over the last year, we\u2019ve grown our deposits by nearly $5 billion, primarily through our direct deposit program. This puts deposits at 73% of our funding, slightly higher than the 71% level we were operating at last year. We expect to continue to drive growth in our direct deposit program by continuing to offer attractive rates and great customer service, as well as building out our digital capabilities. Going forward, we continue to expect to grow deposits in line with receivables growth. Overall, we are pleased with our ability to attract and retain our deposit customers.","In terms of our funding plan going forward, we will continue to grow our direct deposits and expect total deposits to be 70% to 75% of our funding mix going forward. Funding through securitizations was 16% of our funding, consistent with our target of 15% to 20%. Our third-party debt totals 11% of our funding sources within our 10% to 15% target. So, overall, we feel very good about our mix of funding and our access to a diverse set of funding sources.","Turning to capital and liquidity, we ended the quarter at 17.3% CET1 under the transition rules and 17.2% CET1 under the fully phased-in Basel III rules. This compares to 17.9% on a fully phased-in basis last year over a 70-basis-point reduction, reflecting the impact of capital deployment through our capital plan and growth.","Total liquidity was $22 billion, which is equal to 24% of our total assets. This is down from 27% last year, reflecting the deployment of some of our liquidity. We expect to be subject to the modified LCR approach and these liquidity levels put us well above the required LCR levels.","During the quarter, we continue to execute on the capital plan we announced in May. We paid a common stock dividend of $0.15 per share and repurchased $390 million of common stock during the third quarter.","We have approximately $1 billion remaining in potential share repurchases of the $1.64 billion our Board authorized through the four quarters ending June 30, 2018. We will continue to execute the new share repurchase plan subject to market conditions and other factors, including any legal and regulatory restrictions, and required approvals.","Overall, we continue to execute on the strategy that we outlined previously. We build a strong very balance sheet with diversified funding sources, and strong capital and liquidity levels, and we expect to continue deploying capital through growth and further execution of our capital plan in the form of dividends and share repurchases.","Before I conclude, I wanted to recap on our current view for the year. First, on the net interest margin, while we believe the margin trend is closer to 16.25% in the fourth quarter as we expect to see higher deposit betas and the seasonal decline in yields, we are still trending above the original outlook we provided back in January.","The margin performance does demonstrate one of the natural offsets in the business. Some of the same factors driving credit normalization also result in a higher receivables yield, so we are seeing a partial offset on the revenue line.","We continue to expect NCOs to be in the low 5% range for the full year 2017. Normalization continues to be the largest factor and the impact from the hurricanes may nudge this to the higher end of the range.","Regarding loan loss reserve builds going forward, we expect the reserve builds begin to transition to be more growth driven in 2018. We believe the reserve build in the fourth quarter will begin to reflect this and we expect the build to be in the $275 million range.","We continue to think RSAs as a percent of receivables will run near 4% for the year, given the impact of reserve build and somewhat higher loyalty program expenses, which are also shared with retailers through the RSA.","Turning to expenses. We continue to generate positive operating leverage and now expect the efficiency ratio to be slightly lower than the 31% for the full year, ahead of our original outlook. We expect to continue to drive operating leverage in the core business. However, that will be partially offset by an increase in spending on strategic investments, as well as holiday marketing campaigns that will continue in the fourth quarter.","In summary, the business continues to generate strong growth with attractive long-term returns, assuming economic conditions and the health of the consumer are consistent going forward, our expectation is that reserve builds will moderate into 2018, which combined with continued growth of the business and the impact from the substantial increase in our share repurchase program will help us generate EPS growth in 2018.","With that, I\u2019ll turn it back over to Margaret.","Margaret Keane","Thanks, Brian. I\u2019ll provide a quick wrap up and then we\u2019ll open the call for Q&A. We remain focused on our strategic priorities, working daily to drive organic growth, deliver value to our partners, attract new profitable programs and make the investments necessary to develop innovative solutions that help our partners address the evolving retail landscape.","When our partners win, we win. Our results this quarter including the numerous renewals and program launches demonstrate our commitment to our partners and cardholders, and the value they derive from our products and services.","Returning capital to shareholders also remains a key focus and we are pleased to have increased our dividend payout this quarter and to repurchase $390 million of our common stock. And we are doing this as we continue to grow our business, while maintaining strong returns and a solid balance sheet in the process.","I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Greg to open up to Q&A.","Greg Ketron","Thanks, Margaret. That concludes our comments on the quarter. We will now begin the Q&A session. So that we can accommodate as many of you as possible, I\u2019d like to ask participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow-up question. If you have additional questions, the Investor Relations team will be available after the call.","Operator, please start the Q&A session.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we have our first question from Bill Carcache with Nomura.","Bill Carcache","Thank you. Good morning. Brian, I wanted to ask a question on, follow-up on your commentary around credit. The year-over-year increase in delinquency rates has been pretty flat since June at around 50 basis points. Is it reasonable given all of your commentary around your normalization and growth driven kind of all those dynamics to think of that 50 basis points as peak-ish or is there room for that to accelerate from here?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Bill, I think, really what you\u2019re seeing is the delinquency related to both the second half of \u201815 vintage in the first half of \u201816 vintages mature. They\u2019re right at the point right now about 18 months out where they hit the peak delinquencies. And so if you think about the benefits from the underwriting changes that we made, those are just now starting to work their way through the portfolio. And so you\u2019ll start to see those in the overall delinquency stats probably in the call it the first half of 2018 about six months in advance of net charge-offs leveling off, which we think happens in the back half of 2018. So I\u2019d say delinquencies are trending in line with our expectations and again, just really driven by the normal seasoning pattern in those second half of \u201815, first half of \u201816 vintages.","Bill Carcache","Okay. If I may follow up, I had a bigger picture question for you, Margaret. Some of the larger bank issuers who have been a bit more aggressive on pricing appear to be facing a little bit of, I guess, pressure to deliver better operating performance within their card segments and arguably that would seem to diminish their ability to more aggressively go after some of your partners perhaps by leading with pricing. Just curious, are you seeing any signs of dialing back competitive pressures? Just trying to get a sense overall in the context some of the renewal risk that that investors are concerned about in terms of what you\u2019re seeing.","Margaret Keane","Yeah. So I\u2019d say we haven\u2019t really seen a change in the competitive landscape. I think pricing is really one piece of the puzzle. The things that our partners really focus on is capabilities first, and then, obviously, once you get into that process then pricing becomes the end discussion.","So we\u2019re working hard to ensure and you see that in some the things we talked about earlier around our investments and how we\u2019re trying to really work to innovate what our partners really need.","So I\u2019d say no real change that we\u2019re seeing right now and we\u2019re just focused on keeping our head down, and really trying to deliver for our partners as we go through this large retail transformation that\u2019s occurring.","Bill Carcache","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Rick Shane with JPMorgan.","Rick Shane","Thanks guys for taking my question this morning. I just want to talk a little bit about the implications of the tighter underwriting. Certainly, we understand that from a credit perspective, but I am curious how it impacts the revolve rate and then given the lower contribution from interchange on your model, how should we think about low -- potentially lower revolve rate on the economics of that business?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. I think, Rick, it\u2019s a great question. I think you\u2019re going to see the impact of the tighter underwriting in a couple areas. I think we\u2019ve seen a modest impact when it comes to purchase volume. You can see that -- we saw that trend a little bit last quarter, a little bit more this quarter. Obviously, that\u2019s where you feel the impact, I guess, more immediately.","I think, longer-term and I would expect to start see a little bit of this in the fourth quarter. We would expect to see a little less benefit from revolve. I think we\u2019ll still see good revolve rate on the portfolio. That\u2019s the business that we\u2019re. That\u2019s what drives our earnings. I don\u2019t view this as a fundamental change.","But if I think about the significant lift in our margins that we got really starting second half of last year also this year, I think, that\u2019s going to start to wane a bit, and I think, you\u2019ll start to see a little bit of that in the fourth quarter and a little bit more of that probably in 2018.","Rick Shane","Great. Very helpful. Thanks, Brian","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Mark DeVries with Barclays.","Mark DeVries","Yeah. Thanks. I\u2019ll appreciate you are showing some operating leverage with the efficiency ratio falling. At this point you are two years completely independent and well into your bank buildout. I have a question here, are there opportunities to really further your efficiency improvement as you do have peers who have grown expenses less substantially and been able to use expense days as a way -- to -- as a lever to try to offset the credit impact?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Sure, Mark. Look, we\u2019re very focused on productivity and I think so far year-to-date we\u2019ve driven about 70 basis points on the efficiency ratio from 31% last year down to 30.3% so far year-to-date. So we are generating good operating leverage in the core business. We\u2019re obviously using some of those productivity savings to increase the spend on our strategic investments.","Certainly, revenue and margin has trended above expectations so far this year, so that\u2019s helping us a bit. If you go back and you take a two-year look, the efficiency ratio in 2015 was 33.5% and we\u2019ve driven that to just below 31% in two years. That feels like a fair amount of operating leverage for us to be generating while funding all of our strategic investments.","So, what I would tell you that the huge focus of the management team, we\u2019re always looking at ways to get more efficient in the areas that don\u2019t directly impact our partners and our customers, cutting waste out of the business and then taking those savings, and obviously, showing some productivity, but also driving those savings back into strategic investments that are going to pay off two years, three years, four years, five years down the road","Mark DeVries","Okay. Are you able to give us some sense of what we should expect maybe in 2018 in terms of strategic investments?","Brian Doubles","It\u2019s going to be along the same lines as the stuff we invested in this year. We\u2019re spending on digital, mobile. We\u2019re spending a lot on analytics. All the things that are helping us really outperform what has been a fairly weak retail environment right now. These are the things, as Margaret talked about, were -- it\u2019s really important for us to help our retailers as we go through this transformation. So we need to be kind of investing ahead of the curve in order to sustain the type of growth that we\u2019ve had.","Mark DeVries","Okay. Got it. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Don Fandetti with Wells Fargo.","Don Fandetti","Hi. Good morning. Brian, a quick question on portfolio acquisition appetite, where are you on that and last night on the PayPal call, they mentioned that they might sell their portfolio by year end. Is that something that you would be interested in?","Margaret Keane","So I\u2019m going to take that one, if it\u2019s okay. We -- look, we showed this quarter that we\u2019re interested in winning deals. We\u2019re obviously very interested in winning deals. I can\u2019t really comment on a particular portfolio that\u2019s out in the marketplace. However, we\u2019re really always open to attractive opportunities that meet our return hurdles, that are strategic for our business, that allow us the opportunity to continue to grow. So we\u2019re continuing to work hard on our pipeline, looking at various opportunities across all three of our platforms and we\u2019re going to continue to drive that through this year and into next year.","Don Fandetti","And Margaret on that same note, would you be willing to lend in international markets if one of your partners was interested in that?","Margaret Keane","We\u2019d have to -- yeah, I think, the answer is, we would be interested. We\u2019d have to really figure out how we would structure that. It\u2019s a -- It gets a little more complicated from a funding perspective when you\u2019re outside the U.S. So we\u2019d have to figure that out. But, obviously, we\u2019re always talking to people about different opportunities and we would continue to work with our partners to establish something that they felt strongly about.","Don Fandetti","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question is from Ryan Nash with Goldman Sachs.","Ryan Nash","Hey. Good morning, guys. Brian, you gave us updated guidance for the 4Q reserve build of $275 million. A lot of the big banks this quarter were willing to tease out for us, what specifically in terms of reserve build was related to growth and what was related to higher charge-offs. So I was hoping maybe you could give us some color on that as you think about the 4Q reserve build. And two, as we start to see the headwinds from reserve building related to credit starting to subside over the next couple of quarters, what does this mean for the RSA over time? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Sure, Ryan. So, the reserve build -- the primary components are the same, credit normalization and strong receivables growth. If you break it down more specifically, think about approximately $20 million was related to hurricanes and recoveries, the two items that we spiked out individually for you guys, and then the balance of $340 million was really split roughly 50-50 between growth and normalization. So if you adjust for the two specific items, the build was pretty much in line with the prior two quarters, also in line with the outlook that we gave you back in April.","So, I think, as you alluded to more importantly, just based on the trends that we\u2019re seeing and the impact of the underwriting changes that we\u2019ve made, we think the reserve will start to moderate beginning in the fourth quarter and then trend from there as we head into 2018. Obviously, we\u2019ll give you a more complete outlook when we do our January call.","Ryan Nash","And then, I guess, just wasn\u2019t made for the RSA as credits starts to normalize?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. As you think about the RSA, we trended well below our original expectation. If you remember back in January, we thought the RSA would be around 4.5%. We\u2019re now seeing it somewhere in the 4% range, so there\u2019s 50 basis points of an offset there versus our original expectations. You\u2019ll start to see a little bit higher RSA starting in the fourth quarter.","So with the reserve build trending down to the $275 million range versus where it\u2019s been all year, the benefit of that lower build will obviously be shared with the retailers, so you\u2019ll see a little bit of higher RSA in the fourth quarter. That brings us back to that kind of 4% level and then we would expect that trend to continue into 2018.","Ryan Nash","And just last follow up, Brian. On the 50-basis-point quarter-over-quarter NIM decline, obviously there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces within that. But could you just help us understand what\u2019s baked in, in terms of expectation for higher funding costs and revolve rate. Obviously, the market\u2019s expecting another rate hike until the end of the quarter. Would you expect to see the deposit pricing continue to increase even though we\u2019re not going to see a rate hike until the back half of the quarter? Thanks.","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Yeah. Let me give you a couple pieces as we think about the fourth quarter. So, first, as you mentioned, the most significant impact is just normal seasonality. So when you get that big seasonal build in receivables, you typically see a decline in yield as you move from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. That spend is much as 50 basis points to 60 basis points if you go back historically and look at it.","And then, I think, you\u2019ll have a couple of smaller impacts. I do think we\u2019ll see slightly higher deposit betas than we\u2019ve seen so far in the rate cycle. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything dramatic, but it\u2019s probably a little more competition than what we saw all year.","We start to see a little bit of that in the kind of latter half of the third quarter. I think that will continue into the fourth and into 2018. So far we\u2019ve outperformed our expectations when it comes to deposit betas, I think we\u2019ll just give a little bit of that back, so that\u2019s in the forecast for the fourth quarter.","We\u2019ll also have a slight impact from some of the relief related to hurricane impacted areas. We think that will be pretty small but that\u2019s included there as well. So I think you\u2019ve got seasonality is the big driver and then you\u2019ve got a couple of other small things that will work their way through in the fourth quarter.","Ryan Nash","Got it. Thanks for taking my questions.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.","Betsy Graseck","Hi. Good morning.","Margaret Keane","Good morning.","Betsy Graseck","Just wanted to follow up on the NIM related to the forward look here, I think, you mentioned that the improvement waned a little bit, but does that because funding cost is going up or you\u2019re not passing along as much of the rate hike in yields?","Brian Doubles","Well, if you\u2019re talking specifically in the fourth quarter, it really is just seasonality. As you start to look seasonality and the two either items I mentioned, deposit betas being a little bit higher and a little bit of relief impact from the hurricanes. So those are kind of the specific dynamics for the fourth quarter. And then the one, I think, just to contemplate for -- as we move into 2018, in response to some of the underwriting changes we\u2019ve made, we\u2019ll probably have a little less benefit from higher revolve rate.","So if you think about the second half of last year all through this year, we got a pretty substantial benefit from higher revolve. And I think that will just wane a little bit in line with credit starting to level off in the back half of \u201818. So those two things are obviously very linked and so we would expect to see a little less revolve as we move forward into \u201818.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. And then, just on this quarter and 3Q, I was wondering if there was any forbearance activity or delayed payments that you might have done for people in hurricane-related areas. I know a couple of peers mentioned that, so I was just wondering if that impacted NCOs as well this quarter?","Margaret Keane","Yeah. So, I\u2019d say, I\u2019ll start, I think, one of the things that we have to make sure, particularly in the space that we\u2019re in, because our customers, our customers and the retailers, we really have to be thoughtful about the impact on them, because our goal is always to make them feel like we\u2019re caring about them, we\u2019re listening to their needs. So we have taken a number of actions to ensure we\u2019re addressing the customer needs and Brian could you just talk about the financial impact of that.","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Sure, Betsy. I\u2019d say, overall, it\u2019s a pretty modest impact on the business. Obviously, starting with purchase volume, obviously the areas impacted by the hurricanes that resulted in some lost sales relative to our forecast. Wasn\u2019t that material, but obviously something we expected to see.","I think over the longer term, we would expect to see an increase in certain spend categories as people start to rebuild. We\u2019re obviously waiving certain fees and charges in the impacted areas. That had about a 10-basis-point impact on margins, so it\u2019s pretty small. We\u2019ll likely have another similar impact in the fourth quarter.","And then just in terms re-aging balances, because I know this has been a topic, we do waive minimum payments to give some customers additional time to pay, but we typically don\u2019t move deeply delinquent accounts back to current, just given the odds of collecting on those accounts are very low to begin with. So there really wasn\u2019t a benefit on net charge-offs due to hurricanes in the quarter for us, just based on our policies.","Betsy Graseck","Okay. So no impact on net charge-offs for you?","Brian Doubles","No. Not in the quarter.","Betsy Graseck","Yeah.","Brian Doubles","We do expect to have a little bit of an increase in net charge-offs, obviously, as we move into the fourth quarter, that was -- we recorded that in the reserve build this quarter.","Betsy Graseck","Got it. Okay. Thank you.","Brian Doubles","Yeah.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Sanjay Sakhrani with KBW.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thanks. Here\u2019s first question. I just wanted to clarify the RSA commentary Brian that you had. As we look out to next year, I mean, should we expect it to sort of migrate back to the mid-4%s or are you saying that the trendline is in the low 4%s?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. Sanjay, that\u2019s probably more specific than we want to get on 2018 at this point. But what I\u2019d tell you is we think it\u2019s 4% for the year. It\u2019s going to come up a bit in the fourth quarter and then we do expect the reserve builds to moderate, and if the reserve builds moderate, we would expect the RSAs to be higher than they were this year. So I\u2019m not going to give you\u2026","Sanjay Sakhrani","Okay.","Brian Doubles","\u2026a specific number but higher than 4%.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Got it. And then, I guess, Margaret, obviously, you guys have a couple of large renewals out in 2019 and the dialogue is ongoing there. But, I mean, maybe you could just give us some preliminary window sort of into the nature of the discussions and how comfortable you feel on the renewals there?","And then just maybe broader question, it\u2019s been about three years since you guys have gone public and the complexion of the business is pretty much the same in terms of the mix of business. I mean, I know the other segments have been growing quite nicely. I mean are there any other expansion opportunities, maybe going back to some of the international opportunities that were brought up before? Thanks.","Margaret Keane","Sure. So, on renewals, I think, I\u2019ve said this, we are trying to renew every day, right. It\u2019s really a function of partnering with our retailers and making sure we are meeting their needs on an everyday basis. We do have some renewals coming up. We feel very confident that we\u2019ll be able to renew those relationships. We\u2019re working hard to make sure the dialogues happening in the right areas and hopefully we\u2019ll be able to announce some things next year.","And then the second question. I\u2019d say two things. It\u2019s -- we always look at opportunities that are outside the U.S. I think it really becomes a question of -- growth -- is it enough, where there\u2019s enough growth. We have to think about funding, as I said. We have to think about more regulators to our mix. So we want to make sure we\u2019re not overstretching ourselves from a regulatory point of view.","I think what we\u2019re really focused on right now is really looking at what I would call more opportunities to do some tuck-ins where it makes sense, an example is, we purchased GPShopper, as an example. That\u2019s been a really nice acquisition for us in terms of, one, building out our capability and some of the things we\u2019re doing from a mobile perspective, but I think also helping some of our partners build out their mobile capability. And I think you\u2019ll see us doing things more like that in each of our platforms as we go into 2018.","Sanjay Sakhrani","Thank you.","Operator","Thank you. Our next question comes from Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Most of my questions actually have been asked and answered, just wanted to follow-up on a couple of areas. One is, on -- Brian, on the reserve build. I mean, you talked about it moderating. I guess, when we think about, when you\u2019re thinking about that reserve level, like, what do you need to see for it to kind of get back substantially closer to just providing for growth, I mean, is it that delinquencies have then -- have -- is it that early part of \u201818 where the delinquency -- you expect the delinquencies to kind of start to improve or do the actual charge-offs have to start to improve?","Brian Doubles","Yeah. No. It\u2019s a good question, Moshe. And obviously, picking an individual quarter where this is going to occur is somewhat challenging. But I think the easiest way to think about it is, when credit is exactly flat in your 12-month outlook, then your reserve build should be pretty much just growth related.","Now that\u2019s easier said than done, because you\u2019re always putting on new vintages. Those vintages are seasoning, so you\u2019ve always got a component of normalization or vintage seasoning in your reserve. And so that\u2019s why what I think is a better expectation for all of you to have is that you start to see a modest decline in the reserve builds off of the current trend, right.","So going from a core reserve build of around $340 million to something more in the $275 million range next quarter indicates some level of improvement in that forward-looking view on losses. To the extent that that outward view, that 12-month view continues to improve and stabilize, then you would expect to see the trend in reserve builds kind of follow along the same lines.","So I know that\u2019s not a specific answer on which quarter. What we have is a combination of what you\u2019re seeing in the delinquency content, what you\u2019re seeing in the vintage seasoning and then what is -- what does all that mean for your 12-month forward view on losses.","Moshe Orenbuch","Okay. And kind of to follow-up on Sanjay\u2019s question on the renewals. What -- I guess what -- could you just talk a little bit about how you would get some of your major partners to kind of renew early, perhaps not going to RFP and how your experience in 2000 debt around the time of the announcement of the IPO reflected those renewals and any changes that had to be made and how we could apply that?","Margaret Keane","Right. So -- yeah, so, I would say, when -- our toughest renewal period was right before the IPO, because we went out and made sure we renewed all of our contracts so that when we came out to the IPO we had some stability in our portfolio.","I think what generally happens is, the retailers looking for something whether it\u2019s a new value prop, a new innovation or something that is important to them and it gives us an opportunity to open the dialogue up to say, okay, we can invest XYZ. We\u2019ll put more in this particular area but we\u2019re going to need an extension.","That\u2019s usually how that happens. There are cases for some retailers where there\u2019s a requirement as part of their policy that they do have to RFP. So in some cases we just have to go through that process. But, again, I feel like we have very good relationships right now. Our partners need us probably more now than ever given the transformation that\u2019s occurring in retail. I think the strategic investments that we\u2019re making are really, really important.","Having the digital seamless process for the customer, as well as really leveraging and being more real-time as we\u2019re trying to work towards data, I think, are two really, really important initiatives for us to really help our partners as they go through that transformation.","I think one positive we have is, we can see the transaction wherever it\u2019s happening, right, whether it\u2019s on a mobile phone, online or in the store, and we can see how that customer is shopping. And what we really want to get to is an ability to really integrate kind of the point-of-sale experience with big data and make that real-time. And there\u2019s a lot of work going on right now to really try to work hard to get that to happen.","Moshe Orenbuch","Great. Thanks.","Operator","Thank you. Our last question comes from John Hecht with Jefferies.","John Hecht","Thanks guys very much and good morning.","Brian Doubles","Hey, John.","Margaret Keane","Hi, John.","John Hecht","I think most of my questions have been asked. I guess you guys have talked about a weak retail environment, and Margaret, you just talked about the digital component. I mean, could you give us maybe an update on some of your e-commerce factors, maybe penetration of total flow of volume or growth rates year-over-year in that regard?","Margaret Keane","So year-over-year our online sales were up about 16% and if you look at our Retail Card where we have good measures, our sales penetration is 24%. So we continue to feel really positive about our ability to grow that channel.","And again, I think, what we\u2019re really trying to do is roll out and we\u2019re in the midst of doing some of this, some enhanced capability to our partners to make that process from applying and servicing on your mobile phone much more seamless. I think many of you heard last year we had SyPi, which is a plug-in app that we do with our retails. We\u2019re rolling that out as an example more effectively across all our big retailers.","So we see this as a continued really important opportunity for us. And I think similar to what I said on the last question, when you integrate that with really the data, I think, that\u2019s really where we\u2019ll have a real win and we\u2019re working it to try to get that information to be real-time and that\u2019s really what we\u2019re focused on right now.","John Hecht","Okay. And turning to another growth endeavor, you\u2019re looking at the stats the quarter. CareCredit continues to be a platform that you have shows pretty strong growth and I know you guys bought a portfolio from a competitor last year. Have -- maybe can you give us an update on that, what\u2019s the penetration rate in terms of the, I guess, the partners, the medical partners in that concept and what\u2019s the opportunity set going forward?","Margaret Keane","Yeah. I think, what we\u2019re trying to do here is really look at CareCredit. I think, we have very high penetration in the verticals that we\u2019ve been in for a while whether essential to that very high penetration of the partners. What we\u2019re really looking at right now is and you\u2019re seeing that in the growth is expanding into new verticals where we see an opportunity.","When we do the verticals, one of the things we want to make sure, we never want to be in a position where if this is all not done where someone\u2019s in surgery or something like that, we\u2019re doing it outside, any of those types of areas.","But one of the things, I think, you\u2019re seeing is health care costs continue to go up. I think CareCredit is offering an opportunity to our customers to leverage and use some of our promotional financing to take care some of their very important health care needs and wellness needs.","So, I think, we\u2019re really excited about how we\u2019re going after these verticals and driving that growth. And then, lastly, I\u2019d say we\u2019ve been in Rite Aid testing CareCredit as the utility card across some other areas and that\u2019s an example where we\u2019re seeing nice growth as well.","So we\u2019re continuing to look at what are the right areas to continue to expanding in CareCredit. I will tell you that the customers love that product. We have very high brand recognition. It\u2019s a great little platform for us and one that we\u2019re going to continue to invest heavily and really drive growth.","John Hecht","Thanks very much. Appreciate the color.","Brian Doubles","Thanks.","Margaret Keane","Thank you.","Greg Ketron","Okay. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and your interest in Synchrony Financial. The Investor Relations team will be available to answer any further questions you may have. We hope you have a great day.","Operator","Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you for participating. You may now disconnect."]}}
