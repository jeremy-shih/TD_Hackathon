This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode, at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.","During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.","Gale Klappa","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today, as we review our second quarter 2019 results. First as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO; Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Bill Guc, Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Now before we dive into our quarter, I'd like to take just a moment to acknowledge the tremendous effort of our field personnel and support staff in the wake of the most severe storms that hit Central and Northern Wisconsin in at least 20 years. On July 19 and 20, eight confirmed tornadoes wrecked havoc across the area, and literally tore apart portions of our system. Both Kevin and I want to thank Governor Evers and his staff, the National Guard and the local emergency management teams for their outstanding support and cooperation. This was a textbook example of the public and private sectors pulling together for the common good.","And now, onto the quarter. Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in just a few minutes. As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter 2019 earnings of $0.74 a share. During the quarter, we continue to see the benefit of operating efficiencies across our system and the infrastructure investments we've made outside our traditional footprint also had a positive impact. These factors helped us to overcome an unusually cool start to summer in the Midwest.","Turning now to our power generation portfolio in Wisconsin. As we look ahead, we've identified the need for additional capacity at We Energies, capacity that can deliver carbon-free energy. So, just last week we filed with the Wisconsin Public Service Commission for approval to invest in the Badger Hollow II solar park, which will be located in the Southwestern part of the state.","As you may recall, we've already received approval for Wisconsin Public Service to invest in Badger Hollow I. We expect this next phase of development of Badger Hollow to expand our solar capacity by approximately 100 megawatts. This investment will support our effort to reduce CO2 emissions and maintain reliable affordable service for our customers.","In the meantime, we continue to see a very healthy economy here in Wisconsin. The unemployment rate for June came in at 2.9%. In fact, Wisconsin's unemployment rate has stood at 3% or lower since July of last year. This marks the longest period on record in the state with unemployment at or below 3%. And based on data just released literally last week, more people are working in the Milwaukee region that at any time in history.","Also, we see continued momentum with a wide range of economic development projects. In May for example, site and operational plans were approved for Haribo\u2019s first North American plant. Haribo is moving forward here in Wisconsin and what will be one of America's largest confectionery plants. Groundbreaking is scheduled for Phase I of construction by spring 2020. At full build-out, the Haribo manufacturing campus can employ as many as 1,250 workers. So folks the gummy bears are coming","Well, last quarter, I also mentioned that international healthcare firm Fresenius Kabi announced plans for a production facility in the region. Now Fresenius will be joined by another pharmaceutical company Nexus Pharmaceuticals. A few weeks ago, Nexus unveiled plans to develop a therapeutic drug manufacturing facility in multiple phases over the next 10 years. Nexus expects to invest $250 million in the project. First phase of commercial production is slated to begin in 2022.","The decision by Nexus to invest here highlights our ongoing success in attracting companies that require skilled knowledge and production workers. And I know all of you are interested in an update on Foxconn. In June, Foxconn began pouring the footings and the concrete foundations for its Gen 6 LCD fabrication plant. Initial production is expected to begin late next year.","Foxconn has also announced plans to diversify its Wisconsin output, potentially including servers, networking products and automotive controls, in addition to display panels for a range of industries, and a high capacity data center is being designed to support Foxconn's research activities as its campus expands in Wisconsin. This kind of growth in manufacturing in our region is spawning a very significant ripple effect, nearly $1 billion of additional private investment has already been announced in the vicinity of the Foxconn campus.","And now, I'll turn it over to Kevin for some key details on our operations and an update on our regulatory calendar. Kevin, all yours.","Kevin Fletcher","Thank you, Gale. I'd like to start by reviewing where we stand in Wisconsin. As Gale mentioned, on July 19, more than 290,000 customers in our Wisconsin service area were impacted as winds in excess of 80 miles per hour caused extensive damage to our network. Despite very difficult conditions, we were able to restore service to nearly all customers within a week. We also appreciate the patience and support of our customers in the wake of this historic weather event.","Now I'll fill in a few details on the solar investment Gale mentioned. Just last week, on August 1, We Energies partnered with Madison Gas and Electric in filing for approval to purchase an additional 150 megawatts of solar capacity at Badger Hollow. We Energies would own 100 megawatts of the solar park with an estimated investment of $130 million. Subject to approval by the Wisconsin Commission, we expect the second phase of development at Badger Hollow to be completed by the end of 2021.","Now an update on the rate review process. You may recall, on March 28, we filed a proposal with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to set customer rates for our Wisconsin utilities. The request follows a four-year freeze of base rates, a freeze that has resulted in lower customer bills, while maintaining world-class reliability.","After applying savings from tax reform, we have filed for an increase in a typical We Energies monthly electric bill of approximately 2.9% in 2020, and an additional 2.9% in 2021. There are three primary cost drivers for our proposed We Energies electric increases. Number one, higher transmission charges. Remember the amounts collected in rates have been capped since 2010. Number 2, revenue the Commission assumed We Energies would receive from the Midwest grid operator that was not received. And number 3, increased cost associated with the agreement to purchase energy from the Point Beach nuclear plant.","This agreement was approved by the Commission in 2007, when we sold Point Beach and credited customers a total of $670 million. Of course, there will also be discussion during the case about the recovery of the remaining investment balance at the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant, which we retired last year.","Moving to Wisconsin Public Service, our rate proposal includes our investment in the Forward Wind Energy Center and the two Wisconsin solar facilities. It also includes ongoing modernization of our electric system to improve reliability in Northeastern Wisconsin. With the tax savings and other credits applied, the typical Wisconsin Public Service Electric bill would increase by approximately 4.9% in 2020, and an additional 4.9% in 2021.","Even with these increases, typical bills by Wisconsin Public Service customers would remain well below the current state and national averages. To support our strong balance sheet, we are seeking a slightly higher equity component in these rate reviews consistent with recent decisions made by Wisconsin Commission.","We received a procedural schedule on the Commission on June 10. The first key date in the process is August 23, when Commission staff and intervenors will file their direct testimony. We expect a Commission decision in the fourth quarter for new rates effective January 1, 2020.","Turning now to Illinois, the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program is progressing well. We just retired Chicago's oldest natural gas main, a cast iron pipe that was placed into service in 1859, before the Civil War. This long-term effort to provide Chicago with a safe modern natural gas delivery network is approximately 26% complete.","On a final note, others are recognizing our focus on safety and reliability at Peoples Gas. Escalent, an analytics firm recently surveyed more than 50,000 residential customers across the country about their energy companies. Through this survey, Peoples Gas was ranked among the top 10 most trusted natural gas utility brands in the nation, and number one in the Midwest.","With that, I'll turn it back to Gale.","Gale Klappa","Thank you very much, Kevin. With our strong performance through the first half of this year, we are raising our 2019 full-year guidance to a range of $3.50 a share to $3.53 a share, the expectation of reaching the top-end of the range. This translates folks into a growth rate between 6.7% and 7.6% of the midpoint of our original 2018 guidance. And for the longer-term, we continue to project that our earnings per share will grow at a rate of 5% to 7% a year.","And finally, a reminder about our dividend. In the January meeting, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $0.59 a share, increase of 6.8% over the previous rate. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We're right in the middle of that range now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.","Now with details on our second quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of the year, here is our CFO, Scott Lauber. Scott?","Scott Lauber","Thank you, Gale. Our 2019 second quarter earnings grew $0.74 per share compared to $0.73 per share in the second quarter of 2018. Our favorable results were largely driven by additional capital investment and our continued emphasis on cost control. Weather accounted for a $0.07 decrease in the quarter compared to last year. Compared to normal, weather is a $0.03 drag in the quarter.","In fact, June was the 10th coolest in the past 70 years. The good news is the weather headwind was fully offset by fuel recovery, which was positive by approximately $0.02 per share and by additional O&M savings. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter and year-to-date results. My main focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes.","Referring to Page 9 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2019 was $314.6 million compared to operating income of $330.8 million in the second quarter of 2018, a decrease of $16.2 million. Adjusting for the impact of tax repairs and our adoption of the new lease accounting rules, operating income decreased by $6 million.","Remember that in January, we adapted the new lease accounting standard, which had no impact on our net income but does affect our segment reporting. For your reference, we have a breakout of these items for both the second and the first six months of 2019 on Page 9 and 10 of the earnings packet. Neither of these items impacted our net income.","Recall that as part of our previous rate settlement Wisconsin, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. The plan continues and our expectation remains that the transmission escrow balance that We Energies will be reduced to zero by the end of this year.","My segment update will focus on the remaining $6 million decrease in operating income, which excludes the impact of tax repairs and the new lease accounting rules. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, the decrease in operating income, net of these adjustments, was $1.7 million.","Lower sales volume, primarily related to weather, drove a $34.8 million decrease in operating income, depreciation expense also increased by $8.4 million. This was substantially offset by $38.1 million reduction in operating and maintenance expense, largely driven by our plant retirements. Additionally, we saw a positive impact from fuel.","In Illinois, operating income increased by $900,000. Margins rose as a result of our continued investments. Partially offsetting this increase was higher depreciation and operating and maintenance expense. The higher expense was due to repair work related to a much colder than normal first quarter and higher benefit costs. Operating income in our Other State segment decreased $3.5 million. We saw a $2.5 million decrease in margin related to the timing of interim rates at our Minnesota utility in 2018.","Turning now to our Energy Infrastructure segment, operating income at this segment was down $1.1 million. As expected, Bishop Hill and Upstream Wind investments did not have a material impact on operating income. However, a significant portion of earnings from these facilities come in the form of production tax credits and are recognized as an offset to income tax expense. These production tax credits added approximately $0.02 per share to our earnings for the quarter.","The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment increased by $600,000. Combining these changes and excluding the impact of tax repairs and the new lease rules, operating income decreased $6 million. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $36.9 million, an increase of $8.2 million as compared to the second quarter of 2018.","Approximately, $5.2 million of the increase was driven by continued capital investment. The remainder was driven by 2018 charge related to the final resolution of a FERC audit. Other income net decreased by $7.8 million largely related to a prior year item, which was fully offset in operation and maintenance expense. There is no impact to quarterly net income.","Additionally, a portion of the decrease was driven by lower investment gains associated with our benefit plans. Note that these investment gains partially offset the benefit expense, including in our operating segments. Excluding the impact of the new lease guidance, our net interest expense increased by $14.7 million, primarily driven by our continued capital investment and slightly higher interest costs.","Our consolidated income tax expense, net of tax repairs decreased by $24.8 million. The major factors were lower income before income taxes, production tax credits related to our infrastructure investments, and a 2018 tax reform item. We expect our effective income tax rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5% this year. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, we expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a partial taxpayer in 2020.","Looking now at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings packet. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased $222 million. The decrease was driven by tax reform refunds to customers and a higher working capital. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions grew $1.1 billion for the first half of 2019, a $130.8 million increase from the same period in 2018.","This reflects our investment focus in our regulated utility and energy infrastructure business. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 53.2% at the end of the second quarter, a decrease from the 53.4% at the end of 2018. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 subordinate notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plans, options and other programs.","Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We paid $372.3 million in common dividends during the first six months of 2019, an increase of $23.6 million over the same period in 2018, which reflects the increase in the dividend level that was effective in the first quarter of this year.","Turning now to sales, we continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of the second quarter of 2019, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 23,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year-ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volume were shown on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings packet.","Overall retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine were down 2.7% compared to the first half of 2018 and on a weather normal basis, deliveries were down 1%. Excluding gas used for power generation, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 3.8% versus the first half of 2018. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 2% on a weather normal basis. Again, this excludes gas used for power generation.","Keep in mind that the weather in the second quarter of 2019 was dramatically different than the second quarter of 2018. As a result, We Energies experienced a 65% decrease in cooling degree days. I think it's important to point out that the dramatic swing really limits our effectiveness of our normalization calculations.","Finally, a quick reminder on earnings guidance. As Gale mentioned, we are raising our full-year earnings guidance range to $3.50 to $3.53 per share with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range. This assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.","Now looking at the guidance for the third quarter. In the third quarter last year, we earned $0.74 per share, which included a $0.05 pickup from warmer than normal weather. We expect our third quarter 2019 earnings to be in the range of $0.69 to $0.71 per share. This takes into account the July weather in the expense from the recent storms. As usual, we are assuming normal weather for the remainder of the quarter.","With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.","Gale Klappa","Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. And for those of you who would like to learn more about our environmental and social performance, I'll direct you to our latest corporate responsibility report available on our website, which we published just last month.","Operator, we're ready now to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now, we will take your questions. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Gregory Gordon","Good morning, Gale.","Gale Klappa","Greg, how are you?","Gregory Gordon","Hi, can't complain. So Gale, great quarter, considering the uncontrollable things that you had to manage, namely that the huge swing in the weather. And I think I understand exactly where the offsets were, but it's not 100% clear because of the \u2013 all the flow through impacts of the change in accounting for tax repairs. What were the two or three key items in the quarter that allowed you to effectively offset the headwind from weather this year and put you in a position to raise the guidance range, if you could just simplify for us?","Gale Klappa","Sure. I'll be happy to take a shot at it. Will ask Scott or Kevin to add their view as well. To me, there were two big factors. I mean, there are many small factors, but two big ones. One, I mentioned continuing operating efficiency across our system. The second quarter of this year was really the first quarter, where we're seeing the full benefit of the retirement of our older, less efficient coal-fired power plants.","Remember, over the course of the last year or so, we've retired three older coal-fired power plants, our Pleasant Prairie plant near the state line of \u2013 near Illinois, our Pulliam Plant near Green Bay, and the Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The closure of those three plants is delivering as we expected significant O&M cost reductions. So I think that was a big factor.","The second is, again we expected it. But we're seeing the benefit of our infrastructure investments that we've made and that was a $0.02 a share pickup compared to last year, as we roll in more of these infrastructure investments. So those I think were two very big factors. Scott?","Scott Lauber","Yes. And I think the third item, as sales were down a little bit. We saw the benefit in fuel by a $0.02 that came in a little bit better that offset. Remember the quarter was about $0.03 down compared to normal between the fuel and the O&M and infrastructure that all contributed to us getting above our original guidance.","Gale Klappa","Greg, does that help?","Gregory Gordon","Yes, it does. My second question is just you guys are really good in putting out some of your monthly slide deck updates on where the business stands. You don't do them specifically for the earnings calls, but I'm looking at slide 10 of the July investor presentation where you talk about the Badger Hollow Solar Farm and the Two Creeks Solar Project. So specifically what on the margin has improved there in terms of visibility on megawatts and dollars? And is that all accretive to the overall CapEx plan that you laid out in the presentation?","Gale Klappa","Well, Greg, first of all, should point out those are regulated investments. So that's different from the infrastructure segment that we talk about. So these basically the Badger Hollow investments, the Badger Hollow I just in the quarter, we got approval from the Wisconsin Public Service Commission to proceed with Badger Hollow I. That is capacity for Wisconsin Public Service in the Northern part of the state. And then as I mentioned on the call, we just filed a week ago for approval to invest in Badger Hollow II, which would be capacity for We Energies.","In essence, the WPS, Wisconsin Public Service investment would be about $260 million because that also includes the Two Creeks Solar Farm in the northeastern part of the state. So about $260 million of solar investment for Wisconsin Public Service. Kevin, about $130 million of investment for We Energies.","Kevin Fletcher","That's correct, Gale. As you said, the Badger Hollow and the Two Creeks were both for Wisconsin Public Service.","Gale Klappa","And Greg, all of that was in our five-year plan.","Gregory Gordon","Excellent. Thank you, Gale.","Gale Klappa","You're welcome. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open.","Shahriar Pourreza","Hey, guys. How are you doing?","Gale Klappa","Good. I'm just thrilled to both you and Greg are working on the same day. I mean this is a red letter day for us.","Shahriar Pourreza","We know that. That's the pinnacle of my career, I appreciate it. Gale, let me just touch a little bit on sort of the Energy Infrastructure segment. I know, can you comment on whether you're still seeing sort of robust interest around the wind investments? I know the last time you and I spoke, you were evaluating maybe a dozen or so sites. Maybe just a quick status there.","And then Scott, with your cash tax status that you kind of highlighted around 2020. How does sort of some of these incremental investments around the infrastructure segment, could you see it pushing off of those cash tax\u2026?","Gale Klappa","Okay. I'll tackle the first half. Will let Scott tackle the second half. First of all, yes, we continue to look at a range of projects for the Infrastructure segment. We are in heavy due diligence right now on a couple of projects. So we'll see where that turns, but again we're in heavy due diligence, kind of final stages of due diligence on a couple of projects right now.","We do see continued opportunity there, and we're being incredibly selective because we can be. I mean, we're only going to pick what we think are the absolute cream of the crop. Right now, without any additional infrastructure investments, I expect some more to come, but without any Scott, we would be a partial tax cash payer. [indiscernible] next year.","Scott Lauber","Yes, so in 2020 and then anything additional would help us continue to take advantage of our cash position at the end of 2020 and 2021.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And it seems like you guys are filling up this bucket, the $1.1 billion that's in your sort of your plan, somewhat ahead of schedule. Is that something you look to update at EEI?","Gale Klappa","Well, we always update at EEI. We will have a whole refresh of our five-year capital plan \u2013 spinning out another year, it will probably introduce that on our earnings call next time and then go into great detail with you and everyone else who is interested at the EEI session.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And Gale, just I know, I probably ask you this on a weekly basis, but is there a point in time with the Foxconn project that you could, sort of given assessment on sort of the rooftop solar opportunities and just remind us if you do announce a rooftop solar project on Foxconn, is that incremental to sort of your plan?","Gale Klappa","Well to answer the first part of your question, obviously, in the first quarter, Foxconn substantially reworked their Phase 1 development. Based on and they are going full bore now on Phase 1 construction. Kevin was telling me, he drove by there yesterday, and I mean it's, the construction is rocking on the Foxconn campus right now.","So even though they've redone Phase 1 with the addition of a data center, which was not in their original Phase 1 plan, we don't see at the moment a lot of change in demand from Foxconn for Phase 1. So now that they are putting all the final designs in place for Phase 1, letting construction projects and letting construction contracts, we will be in a lot better position to talk with them about how we're going to meet their energy need.","I think solar is still a possibility and we'll see where we go, but they really have not been in a position as they've redesigned Phase 1 to really talk about that kind of detail at this stage of the game. So our plan really didn't really identify specific solar project for Foxconn. So we would just see how \u2013 we'll see how all that shapes out. But I would expect by the end of this year, we'll have a much better feel for exactly how we're going to serve their need and I expect the Phase 1 needs still to be very significant [Audio Gap].","Shahriar Pourreza","\u2026in the quarter. Very helpful. Congrats again, guys.","Gale Klappa","Thank you very much Shar.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin","Hey, good afternoon.","Gale Klappa","How are you, Julien?","Julien Dumoulin","Excellent. Well, I'm just going to pick it up where Shar left it off a little bit, but on the infrastructure side of the equation and admittedly this little bit of a blend. When you think about the gas storage opportunity, I believe the first go around in Bluewater was about a third of your overall needs. How do you think about owning relative to just procuring relative to your total needs on storage? What are the frameworks, the metrics that you might think about in that debate, if you will? And then I've got a follow-up.","Gale Klappa","Okay. Sure. Well, first of all, we would very much like from a strategy standpoint to own more storage. Again, they take volatility out for our retail customers. These would strictly be storage for our retail gas customers. And Bluewater is a great example. Bluewater is actually delivering better customer savings than we even thought it would. So certainly we would be interested in procuring more gas storage, but it has to be gas storage that fits our need, it has to be gas storage that on which we can earn a predictable reasonable rate of return.","But again overall, we would like to own more gas storage. We'd love to get up to 65% or 70% of our expected retail customer peak demand to be able to be supplied out of storage, but slower she goes and we continue to look at various opportunities. But right now the nearest term opportunities for us in that Infrastructure segment have really been in wind.","Julien Dumoulin","Absolutely, understood. And then perhaps related, if you can, I suppose there was a lot of conversation about the impact of last winter's extreme weather and low cold conditions. We saw recently out of Michigan some draft commentary. As a follow-up to last winter and certainly related to the gas storage conversation, what's the debate and conversation in Wisconsin both within your company and at the PSC?","Gale Klappa","Well, a couple of things. First of all, I would say no debate at the PSC, and there is a reason for that. We came through the polar vortex event at the end of January. I mean it was tight, but we came through that event with incredible reliability for our customers. And Kevin and I are both very proud of that. That didn't happen in every Midwestern state. So the Commission asked for report every utility in Wisconsin on their performance during the polar vortex, and we got nothing but praise as I think we should have for the reliability that we delivered.","However, whenever you have an event like that that distresses your system to the max. It shows you where weak points are and where you need additional capacity. One of the things I think Kevin will see as we update our five-year plan is the network particularly, our gas distribution network, particularly in the southeastern part of between Milwaukee and the State Line need some reinforcement.","Kevin Fletcher","You said exactly correct, Gale. As you look at Foxconn, all the developments that we've talked about from an economic development perspective, and that's part of the state. We had already identified the need for additional gas capacity there. But with the polar vortex it showed us that the need that we had identified was certainly one that's something that we need to address very quickly, and we do have proposals before the Commission now for us to strengthen that particular gas infrastructure.","Gale Klappa","And that's really important. I mean, if you think about Julien, the life and death situation of a day where it's minus 26 Fahrenheit with a minus 50 windchill this isn't something to fool around with. And I think one of the things I'm very pleased about is our Wisconsin Commission has always understood the need for reliability and they've always been very supportive of the kind of extensions and expansions that we show, we really need.","Julien Dumoulin","To clarify that's just an acceleration of just your capital budget, and timing of getting the things?","Gale Klappa","Well, we have identified a potential need, five, six, seven, eight years down the road, it's here.","Julien Dumoulin","Okay. Excellent.","Gale Klappa","Very good. Thank you, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin","Thank you, guys. Cheers.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Gale Klappa","Hey, Michael. How are you today?","Michael Weinstein","I'm doing great. Hey Kevin, I'm just curious when you guys, when you were taking a look at Foxconn, are they still planning a glass facility with Corning that would draw significant gas demand? Is that still part of the plan there?","Kevin Fletcher","That is not currently a part of their revised plan to my knowledge.","Gale Klappa","I think Kevin is correct. That is not \u2013 part of the reason for that is their original plan have the Gen10.6 LCD fabrication plant, which produces very large-sized panels, glass panels and that would require an organization like Corning to be on-site. With the Gen 6 plant, the one that they're now building and construction is underway as we mentioned, produces much smaller panels for a range of industries but much smaller in size and doesn't require an on-site plant like Corning would deliver.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And separately, Scott In terms of infrastructure investments are you planning at some point to get into more some solar investments on that side of it? I mean, especially with the Safe Harbor window that will close at the end of the year, you might have to get some inventory in place at this point.","Scott Lauber","Yes. When we look at the infrastructure investments right now, the ones that are readily available that we are looking at is in the wind side of the business. Not that we would look at solar, but the opportunities we're seeing is more in the wind. And the solar that we talked about in the call, that's all in the utility, and we are working to get all the tax benefits there.","Gale Klappa","Mike, it\u2019s Gale. I'm sorry, to echo Scott's point, right now, the economy, we've looked at solar. In fact, we looked at the big solar opportunity six months ago or something like that for the infrastructure bucket. But when we compared the economics that project would have been available to us. When we looked at the economics, the wind projects that we're looking at for the Infrastructure segment actually had more enhanced returns.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. Even with the Safe Harbor tax credit.","Gale Klappa","Even with the Safe Harbor tax credit.","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And one last question. Are you, I guess in terms of being on track for carbon reduction and de-carbonization over the long haul, just confirm that the PTC, Power the Future Plans if they can continue to operate over a long period of time without and you can still achieve your goals. I just want to make sure that that's true.","Gale Klappa","Yes. In fact, just to put some numbers around it. Our original goal was a 40% reduction in CO2 by 2030. We've made tremendous progress and internally, Kevin and I think we're going to hit that goal by maybe 2023.","Kevin Fletcher","That's correct.","Gale Klappa","So we're ahead of target on the initial goal and then the longer-term goal is an 80% reduction by 2050. And we have a roadmap that's going to require some technology improvement to get to 80% by 2050, but we think we know how to do that and it would remain \u2013 and the Power the Future Plans remain operational.","Michael Weinstein","Got it. All right. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides","Hey guys.","Gale Klappa","Hi, Michael. How are you doing?","Michael Lapides","I'm okay, Gale. Thank you as always for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter and start to the year, first half of the year.","Gale Klappa","Thank you, sir.","Michael Lapides","I have two questions for you guys. One, the cost savings that have been a big driver so far of year-to-date performance, how should we think about the read through that has for 2020 and beyond? And especially since a lot of that is for the coal plant retirements. That's my first question.","My second one is an easy one, if I look at your CapEx plan in the July slide deck and I thought it was like page 31 or page 32 it showed by function, and by geography. It always tends to show a roll down starting in 2021 in the Wisconsin and Illinois distribution CapEx.","And just curious, do you really see CapEx starting to come down that dramatically in kind of 2021, 2022 and 2023? Or is it simply because you just don't have line of sight of what the specific projects might be this far out to be able to kind of forecast out that far?","Gale Klappa","I'll handle your \u2013 if you don't mind your second question first. And that's the traditional roll down that we see in years four and five or three, four and five in our five-year capital plan. And really I think the easiest, most honest answer to that is, we don't believe in giving you a five-year plan with a lot of white space in it.","And clearly, our plans can change, demand can change, lots of stuff can change three, four and five years out. So we tend to show you in our five-year plan only what we really, really have mailed in terms of what we think is going to have to happen, particularly in the regulated side of the business over that five-year period.","So I wouldn't put too much stock into the roll down. If you look back over the last \u2013 I guess I've been around here about 16 years. Scott's been here longer. If you look back at our five-year plans for over all those years, you'll probably see very much the same cadence. So I wouldn't put too much stock in that. Let me say this. We continue to project 5% to 7% earnings per share growth for the longer-term. And we believe we have a long runway of capital projects that will support that earnings growth.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And that first question about \u2013 yes, the O&M benefits due to the coal plant retirements. I guess I'm going to break this in to two questions. How much of the O&M savings have the coal plant retirements been for this year? And how should we think about whether that impacts 2020 and beyond in terms of your earnings power?","Gale Klappa","All right. Let me give you two specific responses to that. First of all, our estimate of annual cost savings associated with the retirement of those three plants is approximately $100 million on an annual basis. I don't think we have in the room here the specific number for the savings for Q2, but we are on target to achieve \u2013 on an annual basis, the $100 million worth of savings.","And then secondly, think about it this way, our operational day-to-day O&M starting this year, system-wide, it was about $1,234 billion and I thank Scott for giving me one, two, three, four. We said at the beginning of the year that we thought our O&M could come in 3% to 4%, that was our goal, 3% to 4% below that $1,234 billion for 2019. And Scott, how we are doing?","Scott Lauber","We are right on target with that. So we are through the second quarter, I mean the first quarter is a little bit higher O&M, the second quarter is a little lower, but we're right on pace to get that 3% to 4% out and all these plant closings are factored into our Wisconsin rate filings, which is part of the reason we were able to sale for so many years.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And then when you guys think about 2020 and beyond, how should we \u2013 like will you give guidance based off of the original 2019 midpoint? Will you give guidance based off of whatever the higher 2019 guidance level, you just provided on today's call? I'm just trying to think about what the baseline is going to be?","Gale Klappa","For earnings growth projection, Michael?","Michael Lapides","Yes. And I'm just thinking about the starting point, not necessarily the range or the ending point.","Gale Klappa","Well, our historical approach has been to give you a new earnings per share range, so say in the beginning of 2020, we'll tell you what we think our earnings guidance is going to be in a pretty tight range for 2020 and then we will let you \u2013 we will show you what that is off 2019 earnings, but also will show you a growth rate of the midpoint of our original 2019 guidance.","Michael Lapides","Got it, okay. I appreciate it guys. Thank you much. Thank you very much, Gale.","Gale Klappa","You're welcome, Michael. Take care.","Michael Lapides","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta","Thank you so much. Hi, guys.","Gale Klappa","Hello, Praful. How are you, sir?","Praful Mehta","Very good. Hi. So maybe on the Page 13 of the release package where you have the volume and load growth because when we look at that, I know you mentioned a little bit in your initial remarks as well. It seems like load growth was pretty low even when you look at normalized for weather? So I just wanted to understand what specifically about the weather makes you feel that the normalization process wasn't complete? And then secondly, how confident are you about load growth by the end of the year given Q1, Q2 performance?","Gale Klappa","We're chuckling because you probably heard me say this a gazillion times. I will say it again. The weather normalization techniques that are available to our industry are simply flawed. They're just not that accurate. And Scott mentioned during his prepared remarks, a huge \u2013 I mean a dramatic swing between in weather conditions, between Q2 of this year and Q2 of a year-ago. Scott, you just might want to repeat a couple of those stats.","Scott Lauber","Yes. So we are looking at for the month of June, it was the 10th coolest this last June in the last 70 years, and then 60% cooler compared to normal in the quarter. And the other thing that made it really challenging in Wisconsin here, it was extremely wet. So whenever you had a day that would get even above normal temperatures, it was cool. But even if you had a normal temperature, the next day you would expect the load to be there. It would rain and actually cool everything off.","So it's really hard to normalize when you have intermediate rains during the month and I think this is one of the wettest Junes we had on record. So that made it very challenging, but we are very happy when you still look at our customer growth. We're seeing about 0.7% growth in new customers or overall customer count year-over-year and both the gas a little bit higher in the electric and a little bit higher on the gas, so still seeing a good customer growth come through.","Gale Klappa","In fact to Scott's point, our customer growth, both on the electric and gas side of our businesses, it's actually a bit stronger in the first half of this year than it was even in the first half of last year. One other thought and actually Kevin and Scott and I were talking about this earlier today.","When you look at particularly weather normalization for gas delivery, Q2 is just problematic to begin with because the volumes of gas deliveries are generally so low given that it's spring time and there's not a lot of heat required. I think we have to be very careful about putting too much stock in one quarter's weather normalization.","Now longer-term and you asked a very good question. Longer-term, we have projected a bit of an uptick, particularly in electric demand in the 2021, 2022 timeframe and we're still quite confident of that because of all of these economic development projects that I mentioned earlier and more that I didn't have a chance to mention. I mean we have a very robust pipeline of industrial economic development and expansion projects that are coming on stream largely Scott in that 2021, 2022 timeframe.","Scott Lauber","Yes, exactly right, Gale. And we just took a look at it as we are preparing specifically in those outer years and just coming on our hands, we found about 14 projects that were significant size that's going to get us to the growth we projected when we were at EEI last fall. So we'll be continuing to review our forecast but feel very good where we're at.","Gale Klappa","Amazon is going to use even more robots in their brand new facility and that requires more electricity, Praful.","Praful Mehta","Well that's great and great to hear the confidence on that. So I guess the second question was more on your rate review \u2013 the ongoing rate review. In terms of the \u2013 I guess, you mentioned that you have a request for a higher equity ratio apart from other factors that you've kind of talked about. Could you give us a sense for where that equity ratio is in terms of the ask versus what's currently in the plan, just so when we see the outcome we can compare against what you kind of had forecast in your plan as well?","Scott Lauber","Yes. So what we looked at the equity ratio on \u2013 and it's a little bit different at all the companies, but basically the equity ratio was about it. Wisconsin, our We Energies is the largest subsidiary at 51% and we're moving that in the rate case to 52%, which when you look at our numbers and the effects of tax reform, it really, really helps with the cash flow and the benefits there.","When we looked at our \u2013 in our guidance, we assuming what our current rates are, we will put our long five year plan together at the 51 an attempt to Wisconsin Electric and there's a lot of stuff that will go through the rate case, but we really looked at that 52% is not only more beneficial actually to the cash flow and the benefits we've been taking all the credit ratings at the utilities.","Gale Klappa","And 52% equity ratio is very consistent with the last decision made for a major Wisconsin utility by the Wisconsin Commission, so nothing out of the ordinary here.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. So just to be clear, if you did get 52% that would be accretive to the current forecast of your growth?","Gale Klappa","I don't think you can look at that in isolation. You've got to look at that \u2013 you've got to look at the revenue decision. You've got to look at the return on equity. So it's like Ragu, it's all in there. So I wouldn't try to isolate that and come to just that one item and come to a conclusion, Scott.","Scott Lauber","No, I agree. There's a lot of factors. We always look at it with ROE and equity percentage in combination. So we get through the rate case that then we'll look at where we are by most likely, the first quarter of next year for our guidance.","Gale Klappa","And I stand correctly, this is no Ragu, it's Prego. It is like Prego, isn't there?","Praful Mehta","All right. Well, I really appreciate it. Thank you, guys.","Gale Klappa","You're welcome. Thank you. Vedula?","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Your line is open.","Vedula Murti","Good afternoon.","Gale Klappa","Hi Vedula, how you doing?","Vedula Murti","I am doing okay.","Gale Klappa","Wait a minute. Not wonderful on award winning, Vedula?","Vedula Murti","Okay, fine wonderful on award winning. Okay. Couple of things, you mentioned about the tax rate and that you expect it to be 10% to 11% of balance of the rest of this year. Should we be thinking for the forward years 2020 and 2021 that with the some of the projects you have in the pipeline and whatever that the effective tax rate would be in a similar zone?","Scott Lauber","No, I think when you look at the effective tax rate, you have to take out the tax repairs, and put it closer to that 20% and 21%. Tax repairs are really unique for our Company in 2018 and 2019. So we haven't come out with the range and the production tax credits will of course \u2013 will help us, but that 20% to 21% is a good reasonable number.","Vedula Murti","Okay. And then I guess within say, your $3.53 upper end for this year, how should I think about what the earnings contribution tax credits are from here from wind production on other types of things as part of that aggregate?","Gale Klappa","Vedula, we're expecting in terms of the impact of the tax credits from our infrastructure investments. We're expecting about $0.02 a quarter of earnings. And that's exactly what we delivered this quarter.","Vedula Murti","Okay. So in terms of the forecast going forward on the 5% to 7%, tax rates kind of normalize back towards the 20% area versus the 10% this year. That clearly is already accounted for in terms of that lack of better term headwind, which will be filled in through other investments and rate recoveries et cetera?","Scott Lauber","It is accounted for \u2013 in our growth projections, but it all gets some reset in this rate case here, because it's really a unique Wisconsin item that kept reduce that transmission balance to zero now by the end of the year. So those unique tax repair items will all get we said in this rate case to get back to that 20% to 21%.","Vedula Murti","Okay.","Gale Klappa","And again, because the use of the tax repairs during this year is to get that transmission escrow balance down to zero. Once it's down to zero, and as Scott said it gets reset or rates that are effective January 2020.","Vedula Murti","All right, thank you very much.","Gale Klappa","You're welcome.","Gale Klappa","All right. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thanks so much for participating. It's always good to be with you.

Thank you for waiting and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's conference call to review 2013 second quarter results. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions]","Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language.

Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.

In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted a package of detailed financial information on its website at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale E. Klappa","Thank you, Colleen. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our 2013 second quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of We Generation; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, our Controller; and Scott Lauber, our newly named Treasurer.","Effective tomorrow, Allen will officially assume the role of President of Wisconsin Energy. Allen, of course, has been a key contributor to our success over the past decade, and this promotion recognizes his leadership skills and the broader operational role that he currently plays in the company. I will continue to serve as Chairman and Chief Executive. Allen, congratulations.","Pat Keyes will be reviewing our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we're reporting earnings from continuing operations of $0.52 a share for the second quarter of 2013. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $0.51 a share for the second quarter of 2012. Our earnings were boosted by stronger natural gas sales during a cooler and longer-than-normal spring, a slight uptick in earnings at We power and our share repurchase program. However, the cooler temperatures in June significantly reduced consumption of electricity, particularly for air-conditioning.","Turning now to the economy of our region, Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 6.8% in June, well below the national average. However, in forecasting our second quarter sales for this year, we did anticipate some continued sluggishness in the regional economy. And that sluggishness was clearly evident in the numbers you saw this morning.","Energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines, were down by 4.1% compared to the second quarter a year ago. As you may recall however, we experienced exceptionally warm weather in last year's second quarter. So when you factor in normal weather, whatever that is, sales to our large commercial and industrial group in the most recent quarter were down by 2.1%. Three of the industrial sectors that we served did show some encouraging growth during the quarter, printing and publishing, plastics and the chemical and air separation industries.","Also we're continuing to see customer growth across our system. New electric service installations are up this year by nearly 3%, and new requests for natural gas service increased by more than 7% compared to the same period last year.","Now as many of you know, we have 1 major construction project underway, our biomass-fueled power plant in Rothschild, Wisconsin. Construction is now nearly 90% complete, and we're on schedule for commercial operation by the end of this year. Since our last call, progress has continued. We achieved a significant milestone in May when the auxiliary natural gas boiler began supplying steam to the Domtar paper mill, which is located immediately adjacent to our new plant.","In addition, we've successfully completed the oil flush of the steam turbine generator, and the chemical cleaning of the boiler is now complete. As of today, 47 of the plant's 80 systems are in the start-up and commissioning stages. In about a month, we expect to fire natural gas in the biomass boiler for the first time.","As I've noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. The unit will efficiently produce electricity for the grid and steam for the Domtar paper mill, and we'll be able to dispatch the unit, a benefit that's simply not available with solar or wind generation.","Overall, our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total approximately $265 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. And as I mentioned, we're targeting commercial operation before the end of 2013.","Switching gears now. You'll recall that in 2011, our board authorized us to buy back up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock. That authorization runs through the end of this year. During the second quarter, we purchased approximately 1,043,000 shares. Since the program began, we've repurchased 5,974,000 shares at a cost that is just under $206.6 million. That equates to an average purchase price of $34.57 a share.","Moving to our recent dividend announcement. At our July meeting, the board voted to accelerate to the second half of 2013, the dividend action that was planned for the first quarter 2014. As a result, the directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3825 a share on the company's common stock. This is an increase of $0.0425 a share on the quarterly dividend, and raises the annual rate from $1.36 a share to $1.53 a share. The board also reaffirmed our dividend policy that calls for a payout ratio to rise to 65% to 70% of our earnings in 2017, a level that will be more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector.","And now, I'd like to touch for a few minutes on our growth plan and on the investment opportunities that will unfold during the next several years. You may recall that our capital budget calls for spending $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2013 through 2017. In this 5-year plan, we're shifting, of course, from the large high-profile projects that were part of our Power the Future effort to many smaller-scale projects designed to upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. Over the next 5 years, we'll place a greater focus on pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations, the very building blocks of our delivery business. We've already begun rebuilding 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines, replacing 18,500 aging power poles, 20,000 transformers and literally, hundreds of substation components.","On the natural gas distribution side of our business, we've begun the work to replace 1,250 miles of gas mains, 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and approximately 233,000 meter sets. The primary risks associated with these type of projects, developmental, legal, regulatory and construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the major projects we've completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest. And of course, we'll continue to update you as these needed infrastructure projects move forward.","Another key investment we're planning is the conversion of our Valley Power Plant to natural gas. The Valley plant is a cogeneration facility, located along the Menomonee River, very near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam to heat more than 450 buildings in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our distribution network. We filed for Construction Authority with the Wisconsin Commission on April 26, and the notice of proceeding was issued by the Commission on June 21. If approved, we plan to complete the Valley conversion in late 2015 or early 2016 at an estimated cost of $65 million to $70 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. It's important to note that before we begin the conversion, we must upgrade the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. That upgrade began physically in March of this year, and we estimated that it will cost approximately $26 million.","Converting Valley to natural gas has several very important benefits. First, it will reduce our operating costs and it will enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.","Turning now to developments at Oak Creek. We continue to make progress on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you may recall, the units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous and Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal, blending the 2 types of coal could save our customers a significant amount of money. Our current estimate, $25 million to $50 million a year, depending upon the mix. So after receiving the necessary approvals, we began testing a blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal at our Oak Creek expansion units in May. Testing is expected to continue into 2015 and will help us identify the equipment modifications that would be needed to increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal in our fuel mix at Oak Creek.","Shifting now to our hydroelectric plants, you may recall that we plan to build a new powerhouse at our Twin Falls hydroelectric site on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Twin Falls is 1 of 13 hydroelectric plants in our system. It was built back in 1912, and while the plant is licensed to operate until 2040, the existing powerhouse is really in need of repair. We considered several alternatives, but the most prudent course of action is to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. We received a Certificate of Authority for the project from the Wisconsin Commission in May. We're expecting a permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources and the license amendment from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission later this year. If we receive the final approvals in a timely manner, we would begin construction by the spring of 2014, with completion planned in 2016. We estimate the cost of the project to be $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","It's important to note that the investments we're planning on the generation side of our business are expected to lower costs for customers. For example, the Valley conversion is projected to save up to $20 million annually in operating costs. And our fuel flexibility effort at Oak Creek could save customers, as I mentioned, up to $50 million a year, depending on the fuel mix.","Now turning to the natural gas distribution side of our business. We filed an application with the Wisconsin Commission in March to build a natural gas lateral in the West Central region of Wisconsin. The 85-mile line would run between Eau Claire County and the city of Tomah in Monroe County. The project will address reliability concerns in the Western part of Wisconsin and meet growing customer demand, driven in part by customers converting from propane to natural gas, and of course, the recent growth of the sand mining industry in the region. In addition, 7 communities have passed resolutions now authorizing us to begin operating natural gas distribution systems within their borders, and these are communities that currently do not have natural gas distribution service. So if our project is approved, construction of the line would begin in early 2015, with an in-service date during the fourth quarter of 2015. The projected cost is $150 million to $170 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","We're also continuing to follow another possible investment opportunity, the potential sale of the State of Wisconsin's electric and steam generating plants. On June 30, Governor Walker signed into law a new state budget that includes a provision expanding the state's authority to sell or lease certain state-owned properties. This means that the administration now has the authority to sell the state's electric and steam plants. No formal timetable has been announced, but if a sale does take place, we will expect that it would occur in either 2014 or early 2015.","And before closing my remarks, I'd like to briefly touch on one of the recent developments related to our Michigan operations. Under Michigan law, the retail customers may choose an alternative energy supplier to provide power supply service. The law limits customer choice to 10% of Michigan's retail sales, but the law excludes the iron ore mines from this cap. Of course, we continue to provide the distribution and customer service functions regardless of the customer's power supplier. In late July, the 2 iron ore mines we've been serving on uninterruptible tariff asked to switch to an alternative supplier effective September 1. In addition, several smaller customers have chosen an alternative supplier. We do not expect the loss of the mines or the smaller customers to have a material impact on our consolidated financial results or projections for 2013, and we're evaluating our options for mitigating this loss of load for 2014 and beyond.","And now finally, I'd like to address a number of questions we've received recently about potential mergers and acquisitions. Our approach to mergers and acquisitions remains unchanged. As many of you are aware, we use 3 criteria to evaluate any potential opportunity: First, we would have to believe that an acquisition would be accretive to our earnings per share by the end of the first year; secondly, it would need to be substantially credit neutral; and finally, after due diligence, we would have to believe that the long-term growth rate of the acquisition would be at least equal to our stand-alone growth rate. Allen and I have applied these criteria for, gosh, for the 10 years we've been at Wisconsin Energy and the criteria remain firmly in place today.","And now, with more details on our second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2013, here's Pat.","James Patrick Keyes","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2013 second quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.52 a share, compared with $0.51 a share for the same quarter in 2012. Results were slightly better than last year, primarily because of increased natural gas sales, the positive impact of our share repurchases and increased earnings at We power.","Our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $229.5 million as compared to $222.6 million in 2012, an increase of $6.9 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you will see that operating income in the second quarter of 2013 totaled $138.9 million, an increase of $5.3 million over the second quarter of 2012.","Our second quarter earnings were helped by $15.4 million due to the pricing increases that went into effect January 1 of this year. We also experienced $5.5 million of favorable fuel recoveries as compared to the second quarter last year. Our earnings were hurt by $6.3 million because of the increased depreciation expense, largely driven by the environmental projects at the older Oak Creek units that were completed last year. Finally, we estimate that weather reduced our operating income by $13 million as compared to the second quarter of last year. Overall, these were the primary factors that netted to a $5.3 million improvement in utility operating income.","I would also like to remind you of one item that is affecting our quarterly earnings. As I mentioned last quarter, we expect to receive a federal tax grant when we complete our new biomass facility later this year. Our customers are currently receiving the benefits of this grant through bill credits. However, accounting rules do not allow us to recognize the grant income until the plant is placed into service. We estimate that our second quarter earnings would have been $0.03 a share higher, and our first half earnings would've been $0.06 a share higher, if we had recorded the grant income to match the bill credits.","Now turning to our Non-Utility segment. Operating income in this segment was up $1.3 million this quarter because of the final approval of our Power the Future plant costs in the last Wisconsin rate case. We expect this increase to continue each quarter through 2013.","Taking the changes for these 2 segments together and a slight improvement at corporate and other, you arrive at the $6.9 million increase in operating income.","Earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $17.3 million in the second quarter, which is a $1.1 million improvement over the same period in 2012.","Our other income net declined by $2.8 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. The AFUDC decreased because we completed the final stages of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units last year.","In addition, our net interest expense increased by $1.8 million, primarily because of the completion of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units. Once the construction was complete, we stopped capitalizing interest.","When compared to the second quarter of 2012, our pretax income is up by $3.4 million, and our income tax expense is higher by $3.7 million, causing the slight decrease in net income of $300,000. The higher effective tax rate this year is, again, partly driven by lower AFUDC. Our effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be between 36% and 37%.","Combining all these items brings you to $119 million of net income from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2013 or earnings of $0.52 per share.","During the first 6 months of 2013, our adjusted operating cash flows totaled $684.2 million, which is a $47.9 million increase from the same period in 2012. This increase largely came from the lower working capital needs and cash received this year through customer rates for the recovery of regulatory assets. This was partially offset by a $24.9 million decrease in restricted cash that related to the 2012 refund of the Department of Energy settlement.","Our total capital expenditures decreased by $6.7 million in the first half of 2013 as compared to 2012. This reflects the completion of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units.","We paid $155.6 million in common dividends for the first half of 2013, an increase of $17.3 million over the first half of 2012. As Gale mentioned earlier, the board announced its decision to accelerate to the second half of 2013 the dividend action that was originally planned for the first quarter of 2014. This equates to a quarterly dividend of $0.3825 a share, up from our prior $0.34 a share.","Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52.2% at the end of June. Our calculation to reach half of our hybrid security is common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. The projected year-end debt-to-total capital is expected to be relatively flat with 2012 year end. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","As shown in the earnings package on our website, retail sales of electricity decreased by 2.5% in the first half of 2013 as compared to the first half of 2012. Our normalized sales were down by 1.5%. All normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of leap year and weather.","Looking at the individual customer segments, with the cool June weather, we saw actual residential sales, for the first half of the year, down 0.9%. On a normalized basis, the sales were down 0.3%.","Across our small commercial\/industrial group, sales for the first 6 months were down by 0.1%. But on a normalized basis, sales to small commercial\/industrial customers were up 0.4%.","On a normalized basis, sales for the first half of 2013 in the large commercial\/industrial segment, excluding the iron ore mines, were down 1.4%.","On the gas side of the business, total volumes the first half of the year increased by 11.8%, primarily due to colder weather than last year. On a normalized basis, and excluding the volumes used in power generation, gas volumes increased by 2% compared to 2012. This is attributed to an increase in customers, fuel switching to natural gas and the positive impact of additional gas used in the sand mining industry. Overall, these gas volumes were better than our projections. The overall effect of the electric and gas results are in line with our sales expectations.","Turning to other items of interest. In June of 2013, our electric subsidiary issued a $250 million 5-year bond at a coupon of 1.7%. This bond essentially replaced a $300 million bond with a coupon of 4.5% that came due in May.","Finally, looking to our earnings forecast. First, we're tightening our 2013 guidance. Our prior guidance was in a range of $2.38 a share to $2.48 a share. Our new 2013 guidance will be from $2.41 a share to $2.48 a share.","Before I turn things back to Gale, I would also like to provide guidance on our third quarter earnings. As background, we earned $0.67 per share in the third quarter of 2012. However, a hot summer boosted our third quarter earnings last year by $0.06 per share. Also as mentioned earlier, we cannot record the income from the federal tax grant for our biomass plant until the plant is placed into service. The customer bill credits will continue in the third quarter, and this is expected to reduce our third quarter earnings this year by $0.03 per share. Taking these factors into consideration, and assuming normal weather, we estimate our 2013 third quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.52 to $0.56 per share.","And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa","Thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Quick and simple question. You've obviously tightened your earnings guidance range. You've raised the lower end of the range. That's good, but it seems to me, if my memory is correct, that your sales growth is trailing behind what your beginning of the year budget expectation was. So can you tell us what you've done in terms of a midcourse correction to stay on track to have such a good year?","Gale E. Klappa","I appreciate it, Greg. Well, the first thing is, the bill wasn't too bad at Catch 35. It's a little inside joke, folks. At any rate, if you look at our natural gas sales projections, remember our natural gas distribution business is about 20% of our total business. And then, you look at our electric sales projections. You put it all in one pot and we're about on target with where we thought we would be overall for energy consumption. So there's not been a big deviation up to this point, through the first 6 months of this year, against our sales growth forecast when you put the whole group of companies together.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Got you. So I was focused on the electric numbers, and -- but the gas numbers are ahead of plan?","Gale E. Klappa","Exactly.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","On the state power plants, the timeframe, Gale, I think you laid out was probably a little longer than we might have thought. Maybe we were too optimistic or it there some extra steps that have to go through here? And just could you update on how you see that process playing out?","Gale E. Klappa","Happy to, Jonathan. The truth of the matter is, the state has not announced -- or the Department of Administration, on behalf of the state, has not announced a formal timetable. We know that this is something that they are planning, that they are putting together a process to move forward with. But they've not announced a formal timetable. So the information we gave you in the prepared remarks, it was a sale that would be perhaps a 2014 or early 2015 event, that's our best guess at this stage of the game because they've not announced a timetable. But I don't sense any slippage in their desire to try to put a process together and move forward. It's just we don't have a very good handle, because no one has talked about a specific timetable at this stage of the game. On the other hand, the governor has said publicly how he would like to use the proceeds from the sale if a sale takes place. So there's no lack of attention at the state in terms of trying to put together a process. I hope that helps, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","That's very helpful. And the other thing on timing, it seems like kind of you're now expecting not to start the Twin Falls construction until next year, rather than later this year. Is that just -- but you're still on track for 2016. What's going on there?","Gale E. Klappa","You're correct. We would plan to start next year. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett","That's right, in the spring of 2014. So we need one last permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and then, the final approval from FERC. So we expect to get those well before year end, which will allow us to -- when the construction season starts in Michigan, to do the construction starting in spring of '14.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","You were saying fall of '13, last quarter. I was just wondering, what's taken longer?","Allen L. Leverett","Well, that DNR permit that we need, we have to have that Wisconsin DNR permit before the FERC will act. So it's taken us a bit longer to get that Wisconsin DNR permit than we had hoped. Because part of what's happening with this project, Jonathan, this might be too much detail, but we're literally moving the powerhouse from the Michigan side of the river to the Wisconsin side of the river. And because of that, even though it's the same river, the Wisconsin regulators have to weigh in. So that's taking a little longer than we expected.","Gale E. Klappa","Thank you for the question. We don't, by the way, think anything is off track here. It's just a matter of working through the permitting process, and that's taking just a hair longer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","I wanted to move to a strategic line of questioning, if you don't mind.","Gale E. Klappa","We'd be happy to talk strategy.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. So as we know, this back-to-basic strategy emerged in earnest in, call it 2005. It was centered on rate-based growth and cost containment efforts. So with that backdrop, let me look at the cost side of the ledger, if you don't mind. One of the key themes this earnings season has been containing costs, yet with 7 to 8 years of cost-reduction efforts already underway, I'm having a tough time reconciling how much fruit might be left on a proverbial tree, so to speak. So the question to you is, could you shed some light on how Wisconsin balances your -- Wisconsin Energy that is, balances your near-term cost containment efforts without triggering a potentially longer-term negative impact on the business, be it earnings or reliability issues and the like? And importantly, how we should think about where the future cost savings could come from?","Gale E. Klappa","Sure, I'll give it a shot, and we'll be happy to ask Pat and Allen to pitch in as well. Let me start with kind of our approach, because I think that if we talk in some detail about our approach, it might help shed light on the other aspects of your question. Our approach, essentially, can be broken down into 2 pieces. Piece 1 is we are -- and I think you saw this reflected in a lot of what we talked about in terms of the capital projects, particularly on the generation side of the business. Our first approach is to look for and carry out investment opportunities that can actually lower O&M costs and lower cost for customers. So if we can make a capital investment that actually takes our O&M costs down, that gives us an investment opportunity, but it also directly benefits customers. And we have a couple of very specific projects along those lines that we touched on, and I'll ask Allen just to briefly touch again. That would be Valley and our Oak Creek fuel flexibility initiative. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett","Yes, and just on that note, Jim, in the case of Valley, that's a fuel-switching project. So there, what we propose to do is switch from coal to natural gas. Of course, when you go away from solid fuel for this kind of plant, much lower level of employment at the plant, the great deal of expenses and capital investments that will just go away because you're no longer handling solid fuel and handling the combustion byproducts that come along with solid fuel. So as Gale mentioned in the prepared remarks, that could be up to a $20 million-a-year savings. On sort of the fuel flexibility front, Gale also mentioned the project at the Oak Creek expansion plan where we're -- want to make investments to be able to burn a blend of bit and sub-bit coal. Depending on what we're able to do in terms of an ultimate level of sub-bituminous coal, we could be looking at $50 million a year in savings. Now, of course, those aren't O&M savings. They're fuel savings. But that still serves, I mean because ultimately, customers don't discriminate between O&M and fuel, they're just looking at their total bill. So that, certainly, is another source of savings. And I know, in other areas, Pat, we're looking at things.","Gale E. Klappa","Yes, that's kind of piece 1, Jim. And as Allen said, and we're going to ask Pat to comment here, on the nongeneration side of our business, we believe there are numerous opportunities to invest in automation and process improvement to take O&M out of the business. And Pat can give you a couple examples of that. And then, I'll come back with a third piece after Pat can give you a couple of examples of how we can automate our processes, use IT technology to cut O&M. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes","Sure, be glad to, Gale. So Jim, I think as Gale alluded to, at the core of this are lots of small initiatives where we identify where our process inefficiencies are, where we have a lot of hand-offs, where we have a lot of people pushing paper and not thinking in effect, and figuring out how we can better automate them. And that's not any one big project. That's a series of several that we will do year-on-year-on-year. So that's kind of the core example. But there's other more tactical examples. And let me use customer service as one of them. There are segments of our customers, generally speaking the younger folks, that don't really like the whole experience of calling into a call center. So the more functionality or more ways of interacting with us that we can make available on the web or on mobile apps, those customers would prefer to shift to that channel of interaction. And that is a win for them, it's also a win for us because that's a lower-cost channel for them to interact with than picking up the phone. So we've got several ideas that we continue to roll out applications in that area. Another area we're looking at is in parts of our service territory. That is, universities where we've got high volumes of people going on and off during move season, would there be an advantage to put remote disconnect technology in those areas so that we don't have to send people out every spring and every fall to disconnect and reconnect the meter? Again, we're still evaluating it. May roll that out over time. But that's another example of a place we still have opportunity for cost take-out. So with that, Gale, I'll turn it back to you.","Gale E. Klappa","Terrific. And you may be getting more detail than you want here, Jim. But there's a third piece and that's what I generally call line losses. And that's been one of our focuses over time, in terms of how do you reduce line losses. And there are all kinds of ways, both from a process standpoint and a technical standpoint on line losses. And we've been pretty successful at actually reducing our line losses over time. We were able to do that in England. We've been able to do that here. So there's just hundreds of little initiatives, all focused on process improvement, automation and investment that can take O&M out of the business over time. I hope that helps, Jim.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes, it is. So the bottom line is that you replace OpEx with CapEx, you keep your cost structure relatively flat by automating stuff, and that your earnings growth prospectively isn't predicated on job cuts or major cost-reduction initiatives. Is that right, the way I think about it?","Gale E. Klappa","I think you've nailed it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So going back to one of the little details there on Michigan, I'd be curious, what caused the switching decision now, of any period? And frankly, you alluded to the mines being an exception. Are all the customers here mines that you're talking about? And perhaps, what are the alternative solutions, if you will, that you're evaluating potentially?","Gale E. Klappa","Okay, sure. Well, the 2 major customers, obviously, are the iron ore mines. We really don't know what motivated them. I mean they have been eligible to switch, I believe since 2002, when that First Choice law was introduced in Michigan. And the last amendment to the law in which they received the -- well, actually, the Choice was introduced in Michigan in 2002. There was a 2008 amendment to the Choice law that specifically exempted the mines from the cap. So they've been eligible to switch for -- well, ever since 2008. What specifically motivated them at this stage of the game, we really don't know for certain. But again, I think there's some internal dynamics up there at the 2 mines, the Empire Mine and the Tilden Mine. Those are the names of the 2 mines. One of the dynamics, certainly, that we expected was that the Empire Mine, based on their public announcements, is going to close for good at the end of 2014. And we're not certain, based on the information they've given us, just how much they intended to produce out of that mine anyway in 2014. So the switch of the Empire Mine may have had something to do with the final stages of its life. Well, I'm speculating though, we just don't know for certain what motivated the particular timing for their switch. The other customers that have switched so far -- I might add, by the way, that we are the last utility that I'm aware of in Michigan to see customer switching. From 2002 up until June of this year, we hadn't lost a single customer in the Upper Peninsula. But the other customers who are switching are, by and large, very small customers. I know of a paint store, I know of a bank branch. Very, very small customers. So I hope that helps.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Absolutely. And just in the remarketing, I mean, if you can give us some sense of a net impact. It's probably fairly modest, but ...","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I think in terms of remarketing, and certainly, we have some opportunities for serving some other customers, but also, we simply have to look at -- as we have been looking at, we simply have to look at the future of the Presque Isle Power Plant up in the Upper Peninsula. Normally, if you lost -- if you were in a normal business and you lost a significant customer load, even though it may or may not have been particularly profitable, you would look at, well, what capacity do I still need? So one of the things we obviously have to reexamine is the future of the Presque Isle Power Plant. It's all very early days and we will work our way through this; having active discussions internally, obviously, and with the Michigan Public Service Commission. And we'll just step-by-step, methodically, logically and productively work our way through this.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","A quick clarifying question on the share buyback. What was the average purchase price in the quarter? And I apologize, I missed the total shares since program initiation?","Gale E. Klappa","We have that in the script, and we'll go back to the page here in terms of the total number of shares for the program.","James Patrick Keyes","So Andy, this is Pat. For the program, it was 5.974 million shares at around $206 million, so an average share price of $34.57. For the quarter, we purchased just over 1 million shares for just over $43 million.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","And one other question. You've talked in detail about your growth opportunities, which was much appreciated. In the past, you've highlighted the additional opportunities at ATC, not only within Wisconsin, Michigan, but outside that footprint. Any update on those additional opportunities or is this announcement still pretty out in the future?","Gale E. Klappa","I think all of the information we provided you over time about the 10-year growth forecast for American Transmission Company still applies today. They, as you probably remember, Andy, they do a rolling 10-year forecast that's updated every autumn. And I believe it's October.","Allen L. Leverett","It's done in October, Andy. This is Allen. Yes.","Gale E. Klappa","So nothing different. Still on track and a new update coming in October.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","What was the fuel cover on an absolute basis? I know it was $5 million relative to last year.","Gale E. Klappa","The famous Steve Dixon is turning to that page right now.","Stephen P. Dickson","Yes, our fuel recovery, we are above the 2% band, so we are deferring everything about the 2% band. And through the 6 months, we're at about $16.6 million, which is where the band is, and we're a little bit above that. We're at $19.7 million, so we deferred the amount above $16 million. Does that make sense?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So $3 million?","Stephen P. Dickson","$3 million is what we've deferred.","Gale E. Klappa","What we've deferred. Yes, so in other words, we're allowed to keep for our shareholders anything up to 2% above the target amount or our shareholders have to eat anything below the 2% target amount. And what Steve is saying is, we were just above the 2% target amount. So what you saw in our earnings was the amount up to the 2% target. The remaining over recovery, we've deferred. And if that holds, that will go back to customers.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So you ate $2 million last year, is that the right way to think about it, to get to $5 million this year?","Gale E. Klappa","Yes, that is correct.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just because you mentioned it about line losses, what are you doing with conservation voltage regulation? What's the opportunity there?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, obviously, there's a lot of work going on around the industry related to that. I know EPRI has a project related to that. Some utilities are looking at it. We're looking at it, but nothing definitive yet.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Okay. So your work so far has been on the utility side of the meter?","Gale E. Klappa","That is largely correct, yes.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Natural gas demand. We've seen in a handful of utilities, I think you guys as well, what is a little bit of a pickup in weather-normalized demand for natural gas from utilities to their customers. Could you just comment on that? What are the trends you're seeing, whether you think it's a short-term blip or whether it's something structural? After all, if you look at like 10, 20, 30-year cycles of natural gas demand served by utilities, it had actually been on a downward slope. So just curious if this is a short-term thing or something else to look out for?","Gale E. Klappa","Good question, Michael, and I'll give you my theory, for what it's worth. First of all, I think you're right. Here and across the country, we've seen a little change in terms of the historic past 20 years where usage per customer was going down at a slow, but reasonably steady rate. And clearly -- well, let's start with demand. Most of the demand for natural gas in a state like Wisconsin is coming from residential and small commercial customers. In fact, about 2\/3 of the natural gas historically consumed in the state of Wisconsin is consumed by residential and small commercial customers. So there, very weather-dependent, obviously, year to year, but when you try to weather normalize, the big change has been the efficiency of furnaces. So if, for example, you replaced a 20-year-old gas-fueled furnace with a brand new one, you would get a significant percentage pickup in efficiency. And I think -- and it's that way with virtually every natural gas appliance in your home. The new appliances are simply much, much more efficient. So I believe that was the big factor driving this kind of slow but steady decline year after year in usage, natural gas usage per customer. Now the last couple of years as natural gas prices have really been low and have stayed low, we have seen a break in that pattern. And you can see it in the numbers we reported today. Couple of things going on. First of all, you know when it costs you less per term and your wife is cold, you know you're going to turn it up. So I think that's piece 1. The second piece is -- so I think there's not as much price disincentive to being more comfortable and to using more natural gas. So that may be one structural change. I think the second is we're seeing an uptick again in conversions. If you look at the price spread in most parts of the country between propane and natural gas, there's still a very significant price spread that incentivizes customers to switch from the use of propane to the use of natural gas. In fact, I think I mentioned during my prepared remarks that we've gotten authorizations and requests now from 7 smaller communities in the western part of Wisconsin, asking us to begin providing natural gas distribution service so that their residents have the opportunity to switch from either oil, propane baseload heat to natural gas. So I think that the pricing of natural gas today is causing a changed behavior in the marketplace, driving more customer connections, driving a move away from propane. And that is mitigating, I think, the increased efficiency that customers are seeing when they upgrade their equipment. So I hope that helps.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","It helped. How do you think about what -- you've talked at length about what's kind of in guidance or in your views about weather-normalized electricity demand. What's in your views for weather-normalized gas demand?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, until we see -- I'll be honest with you. Until we see more of a pattern here, I'm not sure we're ready to declare it a structural change. But we're obviously taking a very hard look at it, and if we see enough evidence that there's a structural change, it will change our long-term forecast. For now, candidly, the weather has been so abnormal, either abnormally warm or abnormally cold in the last 2 or 3 winters, and you know, I've talked about the limitations of the weather normalization techniques. I think we need to see a little more data and hopefully, more normal weather so that we can really understand whether the weather is driving some of this change, and our weather normalization techniques are limited, which they are, or whether there's true structural change. So I don't mean to give you a vague answer at all, but I think in another 24 months, I hope we would have a better answer for you because we'll have more data.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up question from the line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Going back strategically, under what conditions do you think the board or what conditions would be ripe for the board to raise your payout ratio above 70%?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I can tell you about how Allen and I both look at it. And our board would certainly have a view, but they tend to follow our logic very well in terms of the financial structure. If you step back and you say, \"All right, there are several components of the business that we want to make sure all fit together.\" All right? So the first thing we look at is what is our cash need? And that's driven by what is our investment opportunity. And as we said, for the next several years, 2013 through 2017, we expect an investment opportunity ranging from $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion. So that's Step 1. We identify our investment opportunities and our cash needs. Step 2 is we know that we want to maintain a strong A-category credit rating. So we know what debt-to-total capital and equity-to-total capital, we know what that needs to look like on a percentage basis. And then, thirdly, we don't really want to be forced -- unless there's an incredible opportunity that we didn't see, we don't want to be forced into issuing equity. And so you put all that together and out falls a sustainable medium-term dividend payout ratio. We really look at it systematically, block by block, in terms of the components of the business. And so I think logically, to directly answer your question: What would motivate the board to materially increase the payout ratio? It would be if we thought there was just simply a derth of investment opportunities where you simply -- you didn't have a productive use for that cash. Allen, anything you'd like to add?","Allen L. Leverett","No, I don't think so, Gale. But you always go through those 3 parts, Jim, that Gale enumerated.","Gale E. Klappa","All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, we appreciate you taking part in the call today. That concludes our conference call for this afternoon. Again, thank you so much for participating. If you have any other questions, the famous Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations office, and her direct line (414)221-2592. Thanks again, everybody.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectation at the time that they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","It is now my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Mr. Klappa, the floor is yours.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the opening quarter of 2018.","But first, I know that all of you are interested in an update on Allen Leverett's recovery from the stroke he suffered last October. I can report that Allen is in very good physical condition, and he continues to be engaged in intensive speech therapy at a leading rehabilitation center. The center specializes in helping patients who are having difficulty speaking fluently. Over the past few months, Allen has continued to make progress. He is working hard and he remains upbeat and determined.","Now, many of you have also asked about our succession planning in the event that Allen can't or chooses not to return as CEO. As you would expect, we conduct rigorous succession planning discussions with our board on a regular basis. Guys, we've done so for many, many years. So, I can assure you that we have a solid plan B in place if Allen does not assume his previous role. The plan would involve a number of internal promotions. We would have great continuity going forward and the board and I are very comfortable with what I call plan B. We'll continue to monitor the situation during the second and third quarters of this year and we'll certainly keep you up to date on any new developments.","Now, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Bill Guc, Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported first quarter earnings of $1.23 a share, well ahead of guidance. Stronger than expected demand for natural gas and electricity, the strengthening economy and efficiency gains across our system were the major factors in our solid first quarter performance. Scott will provide you with more details in just a few minutes but, first, I'd like to update you on a number of recent developments.","Just yesterday, we signed an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Upstream Wind Energy Center. This wind farm is currently being built by Invenergy in Antelope County, Nebraska. Upstream will consist of 81 GE wind turbines with a capacity of 200 megawatts. We plan to invest approximately $280 million for our 80% ownership stake. Key permits and local approvals have been obtained for construction and operation, and we expect to close the transaction in early 2019 likely in February as the wind farm begins commercial service.","Under the new tax rules, the investment in Upstream will qualify for 100% bonus depreciation and for production tax credits. The project has a long-term 10-year offtake agreement with a company that has a strong investment grade credit rating. We project this $280 million investment will earn a return similar to that of our regulated utilities. The transaction, of course, is subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.","I'm also pleased to inform you that on March 1, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved the purchase of the Forward Wind Energy Center. Our Wisconsin Public Service utility along with several partners closed the transaction on April 2. We now own 44.6% of this facility with an investment of approximately $80 million. Our customers will soon see real savings because the purchase of the wind farm eliminates a higher cost power purchase agreement.","And now, an update on tax reform proceedings that recently took place in Wisconsin. As you may recall, the Commission order that approved our rate settlement last fall contemplated the potential impact of tax reform. The order recommended that benefits from a lower tax rate be used to reduce our regulatory asset balances, particularly those for uncollected transmission costs.","In filings over the past few months, we proposed a formal plan with several options for the Commission to consider. Last Thursday, the Wisconsin Commission determined that 80% of the tax benefit would be used to offset regulatory asset balances, with the remaining 20% to be refunded in the form of bill credits. This decision applies to the electric customers of both We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. For our natural gas customers in Wisconsin, the full amount of the tax savings will flow to customers through lower bills. We believe this was a thoughtful and balanced decision by the Commission.","Also, on the regulatory front in Wisconsin, we expect to file for construction authority for our first solar farm by the end of the second quarter. Over the past few years, as you may know, utility-scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices have dropped by nearly 70%, making it a cost effective option for our customers, an option that also fits very well with our summer peak demand curve and with our plan to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions.","Our effort to reshape our generating fleet for a clean and reliable future is especially important at this time of great economic potential for the State of Wisconsin. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin reached a record low of 2.9% in March. That's the eighth lowest unemployment rate in America. Meanwhile, more people are working in Wisconsin. More people have jobs in Wisconsin than in any other time in state history.","And we are seeing additional potential as Foxconn Technology Group has begun its $10 billion investment in a massive high-tech manufacturing campus south of Milwaukee. Foxconn's construction team has set a goal to have 60% of the project completed by Wisconsin-based companies and 70% of the job hours worked by Wisconsin residents. Of course, we have plans that are now being developed and underway to provide both natural gas and electric infrastructure to the area that is now being called Wisconn Valley.","The large scale development will provide additional investment opportunities for us, including approximately $140 million of gas projects and $120 million of transmission upgrades now being planned by American Transmission Company.","And one final Wisconsin note, you may have read that several interveners in last year's rate settlement have asked the Commission to require a deferral of the non-fuel savings from the closure of the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. They seem concerned that during the year and next we will reap some type of windfall from eliminating the operating costs of the plant. So, to clear up any confusion, there is no possibility of a windfall because we agreed to an earnings cap at Wisconsin Electric for the period of the rate freeze, which covers all of 2018 and all of 2019.","Turning now to Illinois, we continue to make real progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Plan. As a reminder, this program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe and reliable. For many years to come, we'll be replacing outdated natural gas piping, some of which was installed back in the day of Abraham Lincoln with state-of-the-art materials. We're currently on track to invest approximately $290 million in the effort during calendar year 2018. In addition, we've been working with the Illinois Commission on a bill credit to flow savings from the new federal tax law back to customers and on April 19, the Commission voted unanimously to approve the proposed bill rider. The rider takes into account the impact of Federal tax savings which are partially offset by an increase in Illinois state taxes. A typical Chicago gas customer will see a savings of approximately $2 per month.","And now an update on our operations in Minnesota, on October 13 of last year, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Recall that in our initial filing, we requested an increase in base rates of approximately $12.6 million or 5%. Interim rates have been in place since the beginning of this year and on April 1, those interim rates were adjusted to incorporate the positive impact of tax reform. A final decision on new permanent rates in Minnesota is expected by the end of this year.","I might add that we're making excellent progress on our gas expansion project in the Rochester area, where the Mayo Clinic is growing rapidly. We've completed the first phase of a multi-year plan to strengthen and expand our infrastructure for natural gas delivery.","And next, we'll turn to Michigan. As a reminder, we obtained a final regulatory approval on October 25 of last year for the construction of new natural gas fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. The project stands now at 42% complete. Our plan is to bring the new units into commercial service by mid-2019 and at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle.","This project calls for a $266 million investment in 10 reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them RICE units. They'll be capable of generating a total of 180 megawatts of electricity. These units which will be owned by one of our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost effective long-term power supply for customers in the Upper Peninsula. And regarding tax reform for our Michigan utilities, we're working through a multi-step process to flow the benefits back to customers.","And finally, a reminder about our dividend. At our January meeting, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $0.5525 per share, that's an increase of 6.25% over the previous dividend rate. Our annualized dividend now stands at $2.21 per share. And folks, this marks the 15th consecutive year that our stockholders will enjoy higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings; we're right in the middle of that range now. So, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be aligned with the growth in our earnings per share.","And now, with details on our first quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2018, here is our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Gale. Our 2018 first quarter earnings grew to $1.23 per share compared to $1.12 per share in the first quarter of 2017. Our favorable results were largely driven by colder weather quarter-over-quarter, effective cost control and return on additional capital investment.","The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2018 and 2017 results.","I'll first focus on operating income and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.","Referring to page 8 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2018 was $545.1 million compared to operating income of $614.7 million for the first quarter of 2017, a decrease of $69.6 million. Excluding two tax items totaling $120 million, operating income actually increased $50.4 million.","The first tax item relates to the effective tax reform and the second item is the benefit of tax repairs as part of our Wisconsin rate settlement. You'll recall that our regulated utilities are currently deferring the benefits associated with the Tax Cut (sic) [Cuts] and Jobs Act of 2017. These benefits will ultimately be returned to customers. The accounting for this charge results in lower income tax expense and an offset to operating revenues.","As part of our Wisconsin rate resettlement, we also agreed to use the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. These escrow balances represent costs Wisconsin Electric incurred to provide electric service, but were set aside for future recovery. So, here's how it affects our financial reporting. The income statement accounting for tax repairs does three things. It decreases income tax expense, increases O&M, and reduces operating revenues related to these regulatory balances. All of this has no effect on net income. I'd like to refer you to page 7 of the earnings package where you can see each of the line items. Excluding the impact of these items, operating income increased $50.4 million.","The following segments discussed will now focus only on the remaining $50.4 million increase in operating income. Starting with our Wisconsin segment, the remaining increase in operating income was $30.2 million. The impact from colder winter weather increased margins $20.4 million and lower operations and maintenance expense contributed an additional $11.9 million.","In the first quarter of 2018, the remaining increase in operating income in our Illinois segment was $6.8 million compared to the first quarter of 2017. This was primarily driven by continued investment in the Gas System Modernization Program and lower operations and maintenance expense. Due to decoupling, the colder weather did not have a significant impact on Illinois margins.","The remaining increase in operating income at our other states segment was $8.2 million. The change was primarily due to colder winter weather quarter-over-quarter and lower operations and maintenance expense.","Turning to our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, excluding the impact of tax reform, operating income at this segment increased $8.2 million. Remember that this segment contains the operation of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding which was acquired on June 30 of last year as well as the results of We Power. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $7.8 million in the increase of operating income in the first quarter of 2018.","The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased $3 million quarter-over-quarter. We transferred completed software assets from our centralized service company to our regulated utilities. Accordingly, the return on these assets is now recognized by our regulated utilities.","Excluding the two tax items we discussed, operating income increased $50.4 million.","Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $32.8 million, a decrease of $9.1 million compared to the first quarter of last year. Excluding the $10.7 million impact of tax reform, our equity earnings grew $1.6 million due to continued capital investment.","Our other income, net, decreased by $10.8 million quarter-over-quarter driven by decreasing gains on investments. Our net interest expense increased $2 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by higher debt levels resulting from continued capital investments and higher short-term interest rates.","Our consolidated income taxes decreased $125 million, as previously discussed lower tax expense was driven by the impact of tax reform and the flow through of tax repairs. We expect our effective income tax rate will be between 13% and 14% this year. Excluding the benefit of related tax repairs, we expect the effective tax rate to be between 21% and 22%.","Combining all these items brings us to earnings of $390.1 million or $1.23 per share for the first quarter of 2018, compared to earnings of $356.6 million or $1.12 per share for the first quarter of 2017.","Looking at the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $179 million during the first quarter of 2018. Recall that we made a $100 million contribution to our pension plan in the first quarter of last year. Also, earnings improved quarter-over-quarter.","Our capital expenditures totaled $440 million in the first quarter, a $110 million increase compared to the first quarter of 2017 as we continue to execute on our capital plan. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of the first quarter, a decrease from the 52.5% at the end of 2017. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 subordinated notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","We continue to expect our FFO to debt metric to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We paid $174 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2018, an increase of $10 million over the first quarter of last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 6.25% increase in the dividend level compared to the first quarter of 2017.","Now, a brief update on sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of the first quarter, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric customers and 27,000 more natural gas customers than they did a year ago.","Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 10 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity for our Wisconsin and Michigan utilities, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 1.6% and were level with the first quarter of 2017 on a weather normal basis.","Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin, excluding gas used for power generation, increased 11.2%. On a weather normal basis and excluding gas used for generation, natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 4.9% and were above our expectations.","Finally an update on earnings guidance, we are affirming our 2018 earnings guidance of $3.26 a share to $3.30 a share, with an expectation of reaching the top end of the range assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year. We expect our second quarter 2018 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.64 to $0.66 that takes into account April weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.","With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the conference call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now we will take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon from Evercore.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Greg. How are you?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I am good. Hi, Gale. Hi, team. So I just want to know...","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hey, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yes, sir.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You must have directed the Jets draft. You had a good draft.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Well, I told them they had to pick a quarterback that would be able to throw over the heads of the two corners the Green Bay Packers drafted, so...","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","These guys got good vertical leap, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Excellent. Sorry about your bucks by the way.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","But onto the questions, can you talk a little bit more about the strategic rationale behind the wind purchase? Because the way that you described it, it's not clear to me that you're selling that power back to your utilities or that that's sort of an asset that would ultimately be requested to go into rate base. And if so, to whom is the PPA, whether that's disposable and how should we think about that? Because it seems like a step out from your normal sort of band of how you think about your strategy.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. No, I appreciate the question. It's a very good question. And, first of all, we have, as you probably saw when you look through the basic description of our capital plan over the next five years, the $11.8 billion capital plan that we're projecting for the next five years, we have a segment in there that we basically call energy infrastructure. And we put that in there frankly because we are beginning to see some opportunities, if you will, for the potential purchase of assets that some other companies are divesting, but they are good assets, they are assets that don't change our risk profile and that's a very important point with us as you know. But they are assets that can add to earnings, that can help us deploy capital in a very good way, that don't add to rate pressure at the retail level in Wisconsin or anywhere else. And in this case, although I think we're under a confidentiality agreement on the exact name of the off-taker, there is a 10-year offtake with this particular upstream property with a A-rated publicly-traded company. So they take all of the offtake for the entire 10-year contract and, of course, it does qualify as I mentioned for 100% bonus depreciation and for the production tax credits.","So, we thought this was a really interesting opportunity for us. It's kind of the first major project that we're putting into that infrastructure category. I want to emphasize that well, it may be just a hair different than what we've done in the past. We are not going to change our risk profile by stretching for assets that don't fit the kind of return and risk adjusted returns that we've always tried to deliver. So, this may be the first of a number that you see in that category, but again the concept is taking advantage of some opportunities but not changing our risk profile. And down the road, we're going to need carbon-free energy as well. So I wouldn't rule out 10 or 15 years from now thinking about putting that asset in a rate base, but that's not the current thinking. The current thinking is that this is a solid asset without ever entering into a rate base in Wisconsin. Does that make sense to you, Greg?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Perfectly. And on that note, since I don't really have any question specific to the quarter, you're as usual off to a great start for the year in terms of your earnings goals. This is actually a debate that investors do have from time-to-time when looking at the current retail rate that your customers pay versus others in the region and thinking about as you deploy capital how are you incrementally going to be able to make that cost effective? And people sometimes talk about the escalator in your nuclear contract as being a headwind for that. Can you talk about the future levers you have to pull to continue to be able to offer a cost effective product as you do deploy capital inside the utility because in conversations I've had with you you seemed pretty confident that there is a long runway to be able to do that where others are more skeptical?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, again a very good question. And yes, I am confident in part. Well, first of all, let me back up. We will be \u2013 in 2019, next year, we will be in year number four of a retail rate freeze at Wisconsin. During that four-year period, virtually every utility around us has had to raise rates. When you look at our rates now, in fact, the Wisconsin Commission just put out a draft, the energy assessment. They do this every several years and they talk now about Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Commission in its draft report just last week talked about how the average bill in Wisconsin for the median income person in Wisconsin is lower than the region. So, we're starting to see others that provide electricity in the region have to raise rates as they move into their cycle of significant building. So, I feel very good about where we're headed from a competitive standpoint in offering a competitively priced product, number one.","Number two, how we can continue to do that. I mean, I believe we have a long runway of O&M cost savings ahead of us. We've announced, for example, two more power plant closures, the Pulliam plant at Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay. And, of course, we've been planning to close the Presque Isle Power Plant for a number of years. You put the O&M for those plants together and you're talking about close to $100 million annual O&M. So, we have a lot of cost saving initiatives. We have a lot of efficiency initiatives that are really coming out of our acquisition of Integrys, plus the opportunity now to actually green our fleet and save O&M costs. So, I feel very good about deploying the capital plan that we've laid out, the $11.8 billion plan over the next five years without any significant rate pressure in Wisconsin.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you, Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Greetings, Shar. How are you today?","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Oh, great. How are you?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. We're doing well.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Excellent. So just a real quick question on the tax filing. How does \u2013 just remind us how the verbal order from last week sort of compares to your plan assumptions, mainly focusing on the uncollected transmission cost balance? I mean, I guess at a cursory level looks like it's more constructive than what you assumed from your plan. So, there's obviously some positive cash flow impacts. And then also, is there any impact of the timing of your next rate case?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Shar, on your second question, no, there's no timing on the impact of the next rate case resulting from the tax reform decision by the Commission, none whatsoever. And in terms of how we view that compared to plan, if you recall, during the filings over the last few months, we proposed several alternatives for the Commission and I guess I would view the Commission's decision, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, as both balanced and thoughtful. I think it's right down the center of the fairway. Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, that's correct. It's 80% applied to those regulatory assets, largely the transmission asset at Wisconsin Electric, and what that'll do, is as you know, the balance of that account was going to be about $220 million at the end of 2019. Applying the benefits that the Commission did on tax reform here will lower it and then you put the benefits that we receive for tax reform for the American Transmission Company that balance at the end of two years will be about $40 million, so makes significant progress on reducing that balance.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We thought it was a very...","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Right. And...","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I'm sorry, go ahead, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","No, no, sorry. Go, you Gale, start with it.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No. We thought it was a very \u2013 again a very thoughtful recent decision and really will make a big, big dent as Scott said in the unrecovered balance for transmission costs. And by the way, I wanted you to know that Greg promised if you were checking on him on Thursday, he'd be working.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","We'll see about that. I appreciate that. And then just let me ask you on Foxconn, maybe as you sort of think about the growth trajectory that you guys have out there and what's within plan, can you just, Gale, talk a little bit about some of the incremental opportunities, mainly on potential rooftop solar with Foxconn, incremental gas distribution needs, so as Foxconn facility continues to progress, how we should think about items that may not be \"embedded\" in your outlook?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. Good question, Shar. First of all, a little bit of background, earthmoving at the site of the Foxconn campus site will begin in the next few weeks and so much of soil has to be moved during the excavation process that excavation in and of itself will take until August of 19 to complete. If you take a standard football field, the 100-yard football field, enough earth has to be moved to basically fill that football field 1,475 times, means it's just an enormous, enormous project. So, basically all of the field work will begin in just a few weeks.","I would think that we will start to see peak construction in 2020. And yes, there will be and there are incremental investment opportunities for us, both related to electricity and natural gas but the bigger surprise for us really is the level of natural gas demand. I think I may have mentioned in my prepared remarks that there's probably an additional $120 million of investments that we're going to need in natural gas delivery, in the infrastructure there, to get gas to that complex. And to the development that is now \u2013 we're now starting to see as you would imagine, we're now starting to see other developments announced. Someone just announced a new hotel just 6 miles from the Foxconn campus. So we're going to see the spin-off or the ripple effect development soon.","And American Transmission Company has already filed for about $120 million transmission upgrade and there will be more to come. Now, in terms of our sales numbers though, Scott will update in the fall when we have our new capital plan, we'll update our sales growth projections that we'll probably start to see some reasonable incremental demand from Foxconn I would say late 2020, 2021.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","All right. That's helpful, Gale. And then just one last thing on sort of incremental opportunities. I think you've highlighted before in the past and you touched a little bit about the win. But given what you've seen is a lot of your peers that have been looking to mitigate some of their equity needs as a result of tax reform and then other various scenarios, is there also sort of an opportunity for you to look at contracted midstream assets? Are you finding given sort of the impact of tax reform of some of your peers that you may have some more willing sellers and is that something you'd be interested in looking at?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Shar, the short answer is yes. But, we will not do an investment that changes our risk profile. So \u2013 but there are a number of opportunities really even in the Midwest that we're seeing today that we would not have seen last year simply because of the impact of tax reform and other companies wanting, as you say, to mitigate the need for new equity. I mean, we're in a very fortunate position where we don't need new equity and we have some ability to take advantage of the opportunity to buy really strong assets that don't change our risk profile. So, I guess as they would say in the UK, watch this space.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Got it. That's helpful and congrats to a great start, Gale, and have a good week. Thanks, guys.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Shar.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi, Gale. How are you doing?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Michael. I'm good, Michael. Did you apply for your job at FOX Sports?","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","They recruited me, but I'm going to have to turn it down for now.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","There you go.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hey, I've heard from Michigan that there is a development of a winter peak almost a double peak in that state, that effectively what it does is it lowers the capacity factor that could be applied to solar, in other words, it wouldn't get as much of a, you know, maybe a lower capacity factor as a result of the double peak. I'm just wondering, I guess in that state, you're talking about a 50% CapEx or I think in Wisconsin, you guys are talking about 70%; I mean if you've heard anything like along these lines?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, not at this point. And right now for \u2013 again it's MISO that basically assigns the capacity factor. And right now to the best of our knowledge that remains at 70% in Wisconsin.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And on Foxconn's move, have you heard anything at this early stage about maybe additional companies looking to move to the stage to be part of the ecosystem that's being developed there at this point? I think you call what Wisc Valley or Wisconsin Valley?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, Wisconn Valley. It's the Midwest version of Silicon Valley. There has been nothing specific announced yet, but I can tell you just from being involved in the project that there are multiple companies that would become a need to become part of the Foxconn supply chain that are in the early stages of figuring out how they're going to locate and become actually part of that supply chain.","But I am encouraged by one other development, and that is Foxconn is really looking hard at a number of Wisconsin companies to become part of their supply chain. So, companies that are existing here that would get more revenue, more production, more income by becoming part of the supply chain. So, I think it's going to be a combination of a number of companies moving to the state, but also a number of companies that are going to get additional business from the fact that they will be suppliers to Foxconn, but I think you'll start to see some announcements here in the next few months.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you. And I'm glad to hear that Allen is doing well. All right.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Mike.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Afternoon, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, afternoon. Thanks for taking the time.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're welcome.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","So, wanted to follow up a little bit on the balance sheet here, FFO to debt. I think you guys talked about a 16% to 18% ratio. Just going back to Shar's question for a quick minute here. Can you elaborate a little bit on where that puts you within that range given the outcome of the tax reform and the sharing that you all described in the transmission costs? And then I suppose secondarily as for the small piece of that, but the $280 million associated with the energy, I suppose it doesn't really move the needle all that much against the backdrop of that. But I suppose one could be perceived as offsetting the other?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, and I don't think so. First of all, I'll let Scott handle the 16% to 18%.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","So the 16% to 18%, it's going to move around a little in there, I would say 2018 because we are part year cash taxpayer, not a full year, we'll be at the top end of that 2018, maybe even squeak into close to 19%. Later on in the plan, it's in that 16%, it's right in the middle of the range I would say.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","But it's certainly not down in the 15% area.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I mean, we're above that, and in some point, as Scott said, we might even see 19%","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Early out in the plan here while we're not paying taxes, so that's why we're looking at other opportunities on the tax front, so we've a tax appetite to help.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Exactly. And in terms of the Upstream Wind Energy Center that we just announced, that could be a couple of cents a share. So, it's not $0.20 a share, but I think it's indicative of the fact that we are seeing some opportunities again that don't change our risk profile where we can deploy capital.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. And in fact, actually just to specify that since you bring it up, when you say the return profile is similar, the ROE, sort of the upfront earned ROE there, as you say a couple of cents is relatively comparable, right?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That is correct.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. And in fact, if I can keep going on that, I mean, you alluded to it already here in tax appetite, I mean in stepping into this contract in renewable world, clearly there is a desire for those paying cash taxes out there to absorb some of those tax attributes. Is that something we could very well see you kind of as a step two in the strategy?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It's certainly a possibility, Julien, absolutely.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. Excellent. And then anything with respect to green tariffs for your own customers as you think about kind of satiating the demand from this evolving customer base?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, a couple points on that. We already have a pretty successful green tariff, it's called Energy for Tomorrow. And we have no issue with expanding that tariff whatsoever, as a number of our customers want to have some or all of their energy be green energy. But I do see there are some additional potential opportunities for us to make investments with customers where we would own the renewable and they would be an off-taker. So a lot of interest there, a lot of changes in the marketplace as both solar and wind have become more cost effective.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Got it. All right. Thank you, all.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay, Julien. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon. How are you?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","I'm very good. How are you?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We're doing well.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Excellent. Well, thanks for all the detailed answers so far. I just had a clarification on the FFO to debt question and around the Wisconsin tax reform settlement. Just to understand, how much is the amortization and how much is the customer refund that you are resuming right now over the next two years as a part of that tax reform settlement?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, Scott is looking for a particular piece of information. I'll try to give you the answer to the first question. On our transmission escrow balance, we're just north of $200 million going into 2018. And I think as Scott said earlier, with basically with 80% of the benefits of tax reform flowing to reduce that transmission escrow coupled with the fact that there's going to be lower a benefit from tax reform from American Transmission Company as well that will help lower that balance. We think we'll take it all the way down to around $40 million by the end of 2019.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, that is correct. So \u2013 but if you look at Wisconsin Electric, the electric customers, it's about $70 million that's going to go against the regulatory asset with about $10 million to $12 million going back as bill credits. And in Wisconsin Public Service, we'll have about $28 million going against the regulatory assets and about $5 million going back as bill credits. And then the rest of the system, as Gale said, all the gas is going to go back as bill credits. So in total, when you look at electric and gas together, it's about $50 million going as bill credits to our customers and about nearly $100 million going against the balance sheet.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","I got you. So that's helpful. So that $50 million that's going back as a bill credit is effectively a reduction in FFO that's incorporated in your FFO to debt metrics as we think about your 16% to 18%?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Correct and exactly. So this is an annual number, that's the 2018 effect, and then similar in 2019.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And that's how we get from over $200 million down to $40 million, given that escrow balance for transmission.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Got you, and that's super helpful detail. Thank you. And then just more a big picture just stepping back question. In terms of the renewable asset purchases, I know you've talked about the ROE, but in terms of an IRR, I just wanted to think about, given the cash tax profile, I guess you want the cash taxpayer in 2018. So the returns get pushed out a little bit in terms of your ability to utilize the tax attributes of these assets. What kind of IRR thresholds are you looking at as you look at renewable purchases?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I think you may have one little fact just slightly off. Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, so this transaction will close in 2019.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","February, we think of 2019.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. And we'll be a full cash taxpayer then. So we'll get the full benefits of the production tax credits, and we'll also since this is not considered utility property, it's outside the utility, we'll get 100% bonus depreciation also on those assets. And we look at it as if we're buying in the utility and what that regulated return would be around that 10% or 11%.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. We'll probably finance just like we do our normal assets, 50% equity, 50% debt, if that helps.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And that's all internal funding of the equity, no external shares we're issuing, none.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Correct. Correct.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Got you. Got you. That's helpful. So that lines up well, I guess with your cash tax profile in 2019 in terms of the close of this deal.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Exactly.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Okay. And then...","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You must have been in the room when we were talking about this.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","I guess, just a final question, I heard you mention a little bit of opportunity around the midstream side, and looking at some assets on that side or an opportunity on that side. Is that something you're looking at as a cash transaction? Is that how you're thinking of it? And if yes, what kind of holding company debt would you be looking to kind of take on as you look at some of these transactions?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, I think one of your colleagues brought that up as a potential example. Let me go back to our five-year capital plan. And when you look at the pie chart that breaks down our $11.8 billion of capital spend over the next five years, you will see a segment called energy infrastructure and that segment is designed for us to deploy capital into the types of things we're talking about opportunistically. So, whether that's a fully contracted midstream pipe or whether that's a fully contracted wind farm or whether that's an investment with a customer that we would invest in solar or a gas storage. So there's a whole range of energy infrastructure type projects that we are going to be analyzing and looking at, as part of that five-year capital plan. This is the first entry into that segment.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. So in addition, we're looking at our holding company debt and like Gale said over that five-year plan that holding company debt to total debt to be 30% or less. Now, if some great opportunities come earlier in the plan, that percentage may go up a little bit and then we'll work it back down like we have done in the past when there are opportunities exist. So we did Bluewater gas storage. Now we have this one. If there's other opportunities out there we can take advantage of and get a return without changing the profile, we'll be looking at that.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. But the general concept is, as Scott just said so well, holding company debt to total debt at about 30%.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc..","Got you. Super helpful, guys. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're more than welcome. Great questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Greetings, Paul. How are you today?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Well, Gale. How are you?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We're fine. We're just fine.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I think you probably just answered my question, but this Upstream is not an incremental capital, it was already baked into the forecast with a placeholder?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That is correct. Yes.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then you alluded to the fact that you're kicking tires out there. How big could this get?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, again, we've nailed down a segment for the next five years and the total amount in that segment, Scott, is roughly...","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It's approximately $1 billion over that five years.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. And I think there are opportunities that could certainly take us to that level over the five-year period. So, for the next five years, think about and maybe an incremental $700 million on top of where we are today.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And where is Upstream going to sit in the corporate structure?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It will be a separate sub...","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It will be in that infrastructure segment...","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","...where we have our We Power assets, our Bluewater Holding, and then this will also be in the infrastructure segment.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. So it'll be a separate sub in the infrastructure segment.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then just to clarify, I think I heard you say no external equity but possibly tax equity?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No external equity. It'll all be funded internally. We do have the benefit of the production tax credits since we are a cash taxpayer starting at the end of 2018.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, so read our lips, no new equity issuance.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","But could you say you might be tax equity investors?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","If that opportunity exists and we could get a reasonable return.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, we'd have to be both of those things, and overall not changing our risk profile. And if you'd like to go the Antelope County in Nebraska to see the Upstream under construction, we'd be happy to take you there.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I think I'll pass on that one. All right. Go Cav (48:12).","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hi, Gale, hi, Scott.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","How are you doing?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","How are you, Michael?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I'm fine. I'll take you up on the Nebraska and buy you a tune of the seven states in the Union I've not been to.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","All right, there you go.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","But let's find a Saturday and college football.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That would be excellent.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","One or two questions, I want to make sure I understood some of the Foxconn comments. Are you effectively raising your $11 plus billion CapEx guidance for the next few years based on some of the commentary about gas infrastructure needs and ATC related needs for Foxconn?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Not yet. I mean that may come depending upon the ancillary development, the additional development that we think will occur in that area, but at the moment, we're sticking with the $11.8 billion.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. And just to make sure I understand the net cash impact of all of the different tax reform items that are kind of floating around. How should we think about what that does to just total cash flow over the next one or two years? How much does that bring cash flow down?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So there's a couple items. One, the bill credits that we're giving on an annual basis is going to be approximately $50 million in 2018 and 2019. Now, the other cash flow item is with the change in tax reform, we were going to be a cash taxpayer in 2019 and that moved up to 2018. So that's probably another I would say, $80 million to $100 million additional cash flow drag on the system that we have factored in into our FFO to debt metrics.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. So the total new impact for the Wisconsin kind of settlement that was discussed at the PSCW meeting last week, is really the electric bill credits, the $50 million.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. That's electric and gas bill credits, correct.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. That's together electric and gas.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. One question on solar, want to make sure I understand what do you think kind of like the levelized cost of solar in Wisconsin likely is?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, we're seeing some pretty interesting numbers but under $1,300 on installed kW.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. And capacity factors that gets you into \u2013 if it were a PPA or if it were a rate-based asset, are we talking about something in the 30s per megawatt hour or above or below that level?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. Ballpark $0.03, yeah.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you, guys, much appreciate it.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're more than welcome, Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Bone with Deutsche Bank.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Greetings, Caroline.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon. So a lot of my questions have been answered, but I thought I'd just ask. You've obviously had a lot of success driving lower O&M since the Integrys deal and I know going forward, you expect to see a lot of savings from plant closures. But I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more in detail about what's been driving the cost reductions, particularly in Q1?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, I wouldn't just be happy to chat about that, I wouldn't necessarily separate out Q1 from any of the other type of progress that we've made because Q1 was a continuation of really the efforts that we've had underway since the acquisition of Integrys.","So let me start first by saying the Integrys acquisition has allowed us to really streamline operations across our seven operating utilities. We now have six of the seven companies on the same billing platform. I mean, just to give you an example of now that we have most of our companies on the same customer information and billing system, we can optimize our call centers. We can reduce costs and improve quality. And that's just one example of thousands of examples of what the broader footprint and platform that we have now that we're the eighth largest natural gas distributor in America and one of the 13 largest publicly traded utility systems in the country, with 4.5 million customers. I mean, we just have tremendous opportunities that continue to surface related to driving efficiency and cost savings across the system.","So we are \u2013 I mean there isn't any question about it. We are exceeding our initial projections on cost savings and efficiencies from the Integrys acquisition. But it is not one single thing. I mean it is every area where we're seeing gains and where our managers are really doing a good job driving efficiency. It's every single group, it's every single department, it's every single area of the company, and I'm looking at our new Executive Vice President and General Counsel, our Legal \u2013 no, I'm kidding.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That will come too.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","All right. Thank you. I guess then my other question is just on you mentioned obviously the stories about customers asking for you guys to defer non-fuel savings related to Pleasant Prairie and I was just curious as to when you expect the PSC to actually rule on that?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, first of all, my understanding of this particular docket is that the Commission has 60 days from the receipt of the request to decide even whether to take up the issue. So we will make a response shortly to the request. But again, when you look at the request, it's really \u2013 I mean, we're being very consistent with the rate settlement and our promises in the rate settlement. I mean, we said, for example, multiple times during the process of the rate review last year that in order to maintain the financial integrity of the company and for these rates, we would have to cut about $115 million of costs out of the company. Well, the closure of Pleasant Prairie is just one of many initiatives. And I think that somehow as I mentioned, there may be some concern that oh, my goodness, we'll have some windfall but as you know, as part of the rate settlement, we're earnings capped so there will be no windfall here.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right, right. Okay, thanks. And then actually just one follow-up on the wind deal. So, you are guys are going to be buying an operating project once it's completed or actually involved in the building? Sorry to just clarify that.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No. Very good question. We will be buying 80% of an operating project once it starts operating.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. All right. Thanks very much.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're more than welcome. Very good questions.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Dan, you still have a job, that's fantastic.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Another week or two, I guess.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","How are you, Dan? Long time, no talk too?","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Pretty good. How are you doing?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We're fine.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So, Carol just stole some of my questions I was going to ask about the O&M, but earlier you mentioned the $100 million from shutting down Presque Isle and I guess, Pleasant Prairie I think.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Pulliam in Green Bay.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Oh, Pulliam, okay. So is that a gross savings or is that because you're going to have some additional costs from the new gas plant and et cetera? So is that the gross savings or the net savings or how should we...","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, that would be simply just the O&M reduction from the closure of the plant. So in your terminology, would be gross savings.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And I think they're gross, but...","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Right, right, right. But that's not the bottom line impact you'll see from those closures because they're like for example in Michigan, you'll have the new plant operating costs, which would be lower probably than the coal cost, but still...","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes, substantially lower. Substantially lower, yes. But you're correct. Your analysis is correct.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","And when is the timing for both of those again the close?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","The plan is to close Pulliam as soon as American Transmission Company completes the transmission upgrade in that area, which we're hoping will be in the fourth quarter of this year, but certainly by year end would be our plan. And then on Presque Isle, essentially the gating factor there is completion of the RICE units that we've talked about, these reciprocal internal combustion engines, and we would expect to be able to close Presque Isle by mid-to-late 2019.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Gale E.

Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.","During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers.","In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available later today.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale Klappa","Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us, as we review our 2014 third quarter results.","Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer.","Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the third quarter of 2014. This compares with earnings of $0.60 for last year's third quarter. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of the Integrys Energy Group.","The headline for this quarter, of course, was our cool summer weather. So you maybe wondering how cool was it? Well, three numbers best describe the summer temperatures in our region, 19, 65, and zero.","In the third quarter, we had 19 days, when the high temperature for the day never reached 70 degrees. There were 65 days, when the high temperature never reached 80 degrees. And finally, we had zero 90 degree days in Milwaukee this summer.","But even with the sharply lower customer demand for air conditioning, we continued to deliver solid results. Our focus on financial discipline and industry-leading reliability continued to serve us well.","Turning now to the state of the economy. Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 5.5% in September and remains well below the national average. In fact, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it's been since 2008. And as the economy has continued to improve over the course of the year, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers have also edged higher.","For the first three quarters of the year, our large customers excluding the iron ore mines, consumed 1.3% more electricity than during the corresponding nine months a year ago. And if you look at the data on a weather -normalized basis, total retail sales of electricity have grown by 2.1% during the first nine moths of 2014.","We're seeing recent strength in four sectors of the economy; paper manufacturing, food products, rubber and plastics production, and metal fabricating. In addition, we continue to see stronger customer growth across our system. New electric service connections are up by 4.8% and new natural gas installations are up by actually more than 20% compared with the same period last year.","Later in my remarks, I'll update you on several positive developments in our core business as well as the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress on obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys.","To refresh your memory, on June 23, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Combining the two companies to form the WEC Energy Group will create a strong electric and natural gas delivery company with deep operational expertise, scale, and the financial resources to meet the region's future energy needs.","We'll serve nearly 4.4 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota. In fact, the combination will create the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America, and the strong cash flow of the combined company will be invested prudently in new and upgraded energy infrastructure.","Now, as you're well aware, we have consistently used three criteria to evaluate any potential acquisition opportunity. First, we would have to believe that the acquisition would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing.","Second, it would need to be largely credit neutral. And finally, we would have to believe that the long-term growth rate of any acquisition would be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate.","I am pleased to report that we believe this combination meets or exceeds all three criteria. We expect the combined company will be able to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either one of us projecting on a standalone basis. And importantly, more than 99% of these earnings would come from regulated businesses.","Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity. And over time, we'll enhance the operations of the seven utilities that will be part of our energy group by incorporating best practices systemwide.","In addition, as many of you know, Integrys today is one of the major owners of American Transmission Company, with a 34.1% interest. Wisconsin Energy is the second largest owner with a 26.2% interest. The combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest transmission companies of the country.","ATC, if you haven't noticed, has a new 10-year capital investment plan that was just rolled out. In that 10-year plan, ATC plans to bolster electric reliability across our region. ATC's capital plan for the years 2014 to 2023 calls for investment of $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion. We believe it's a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business.","Moving on to our dividend policy. Just a reminder, in the period before closing, Wisconsin Energy plans to continue its current dividend policy, which calls for a 7% to 8% annual increase in the dividend. At closing, we would expect a further dividend increase of 7% to 8% for Wisconsin Energy shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. Then going forward, the projected payout target for the combined company will be 65% to 70% of earnings.","Now, as you know, the transaction is subject to approvals from the shareholders of both companies and from several regulatory agencies. These agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Public Service Commissions of Wisconsin and Michigan, The Illinois Commerce Commission, and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The transaction also is subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions.","We filed with all four state utility commissions on August 6, and we're currently working through the respective proceedings. In Wisconsin, the Commission has set a schedule for the case with a vote expected to take place no later than March 20, 2015. In Illinois, the Illinois Commerce Commission staff has proposed a schedule that calls for an ICC decision on July 6, 2015.","In Michigan, a revised schedule calls for a decision by the Michigan Commission in June of 2015. And in Minnesota, the State Attorney General has recommended that the Minnesota Commission open a docket to review the transaction, and the Minnesota's Department of Commerce has requested additional information before the end of this month.","In addition, we filed our application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on August 15. The public comment period at FERC closed on October 17, and we filed our response to those comments yesterday.","We also filed our Hart-Scott-Rodino application on September 24. I'm very pleased to report that the Department of Justice closed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act on October 24 with no further action required by the company. This clears the way for the acquisition under federal antitrust rules.","In other developments, the Securities and Exchange Commission has declared our registration statement effective. And as a result, we scheduled our special shareholder meeting for November 21. Integrys has also scheduled to hold its shareholder meeting the same day. We're making really good progress on all the regulatory fronts, and we anticipate closing the transaction during the second half of 2015.","And one more item related to Integrys, back in June, Integrys announced the sale of its unregulated power and natural gas marketing business to Exelon. Exelon will pay $60 million for the Integrys\u2019 retail operations, plus adjusted networking capital at the time of closing. On October 14, the Federal Trade Commission granted early termination of the waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act, and Integrys expects now to complete the sale and have the closing by the end of this year.","To summarize, we believe our acquisition of Integrys will create the premiere regulated utility system in the Midwest, with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come. The benefits to all of our stakeholders from the customers and communities we serve, to the people we employ to the shareholders who count on us to create value, are clear, compelling and achievable.","And now turning back to recent developments in our core business. As you may recall, in mid-July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission, approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral in the west central Wisconsin. The 85 miles of pipeline and connected facilities will run from northern Eau Claire County, in the far western part of the state, to the city of Tomah in west central Wisconsin. The project will address reliability concerns of that region and meet growing demand.","Demand of course has been driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in western Wisconsin. The Commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route, and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities.","In mid-August, we received a permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, approving with minimal modification our mitigation plan for wetlands and waterways. And on October 7, we began work on portions of the downstream facilities, with construction of the larger diameter lateral scheduled to begin early next year. We expect to complete this project in the fourth quarter of 2015, and our projected cost is between $175 million and $185 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we're converting the fuel source for our Valley power plant from coal to natural gas. As a reminder, the two unit Valley plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee.","Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center, and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. We're on time and on budget with this gas conversion project. And a major milestone for the project, we achieved first fire on natural gas in Unit 1 at Valley on October 2.","However, tuning is now nearly complete and the unit will be available and fueled by natural gas for the first time for the winter heating season. Unit 2 at Valley is now scheduled to be converted to natural gas next year. We expect the total conversion cost to be $65 million to $70 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","And you may also recall that in March of last year, we began a major upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the Valley facility. This $30 million pipeline replacement project was completed on time and on budget in August.","Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating cost for the units and enhance the environmental performance. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at about 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.","Next, I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Twin Falls was built back in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. The plant is located on the boarder of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Construction is underway now to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity that meets current federal standards.","Since our last update, we've made really good progress on the major construction work at Twin Falls. The upstream cofferdam has been completed and rock excavation is well underway with completion expected later this year. We plan to begin construction of the new powerhouse itself in the spring, and we're still slated to complete the project in the summer of 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million, excluding allowance for funds used during constructions.","We're also making excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at the new Oak Creek expansion units. As you'll recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year, depending on the fuel mix.","Last year we received environmental approvals, began making changes to the boilers and testing a blend of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. This summer we took the next step, we filed a request with the Commission in Wisconsin to approve additional capital spending for modifications of the plant. Our share of that investment will be $21 million. If approved, these modifications will support operations of up to 60% PRB blend and testing of up to a 100% PRB blend.","So with the older coal units at Oak Creek already burning PRB and the newer units burning more PRB, we clearly need to have the space and equipment to handle additional coal inventory on-site. As a result, we filed a request just a few days ago with the Wisconsin Commission for an expanded coal storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our estimated capital cost for this part of the project is $58 million.","In summary, we see significant investment opportunities in our core business, including our focus on delivering the future, as we also continue to work on our aging distribution networks. Our capital budget, as you may recall, estimates spending of $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion over the five-year period, 2014 through 2018. And over the 10-year period, from 2014 through 2023, we expect to invest between $6.5 billion and $7.1 billion. We'll keep you posted, as our effort to upgrade the region's energy infrastructure moves on.","And finally, turning to Wisconsin rate matters. In May we reached a settlement facilitated by the Wisconsin Commission staff with three major customer groups. The settlement covers return on equity, capital structure and base rate changes for the forward looking test years 2015 and 2016.","If approved by the Commission, Wisconsin Electric will have a return on equity going forward of 10.2% with no change in its capital structure. And Wisconsin Gas will have a return on equity of 10.3% with a higher equity component in its capital structure. The equity component for Wisconsin Gas would increase from 47.5% to 49.5%. Based on this settlement non-fuel electric rates would increase by 1.4%, beginning in 2015.","The remainder of the rate case has been focused on rate design and fuel cost recovery for 2015. Hearings were held by the Commission in September and October here in the state, and a decision from the Commission is expected before the end of the year with new rates to take effect on January 1.","With that, I'll turn things over to our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes, for more details on our third quarter results. Pat?","Patrick Keyes","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2014 adjusted third quarter earnings were $0.57 a share compared to $0.60 a share for the same quarter in 2013. Our GAAP earnings for the quarter were $0.56 a share, which includes cost associated with the acquisition of Integrys. Our consolidated operating income for the third quarter was $246.1 million as compared to $258 million in 2013. That's a decline of $11.9 million.","Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you will see that operating income in the third quarter of 2014 totaled $158.4 million, a decrease of $8.2 million from the third quarter of 2013. As Gale mentioned, the cool wet summer reduced our cooling mode, and as a result our margins were $28.6 million lower than last year.","The cool weather also had an impact on our fuel recoveries, because hourly prices for opportunity sales in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator market were lower, we had fewer dollars to flow back through the fuel cost recovery role. Therefore on a quarter-over-quarter basis, our fuel recoveries were down by $16.5 million.","On the positive side, our utility operating and maintenance cost were $22 million lower than the same period last year, reflecting lower benefits cost and effective cost controls. Our earnings were also helped by $15.9 million related to the accounting on the treasury grant for our new biomass plant. Combining these and other factors results in the $8.2 million decrease in utility operating income in the third quarter of 2014 as compared with the same quarter in the prior year.","Operating income in our Non-Utility segment was essentially level on a quarter-over-quarter basis, which is in line with our expectations. Our corporate and other segment had a $4.1 million reduction in income, virtually all of which related to the acquisition of Integrys. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at the $11.9 million decrease in operating income.","Earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $18 million in the third quarter, which is up about $900,000 for the same period in 2013. Our other income net declined by $2.2 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased largely, because our biomass plant was placed in service in the fourth quarter of 2013.","In addition, our net interest expense declined by $1.6 million, primarily because of lower long-term interest rates and lower debt levels. When compared to the third quarter of 2013, our tax expense in down slightly. However, we have a slightly higher effective tax rate due in part to the inability to deduct certain cost related to the acquisition.","We expect our effective tax rate for 2014 will be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $126.3 million of reported net income for the third quarter of 2014 or earnings of $0.56 per share.","Adjusted earnings, which exclude $0.01 of acquisition cost, were $0.57 per share. For the first nine months of 2014, our adjusted earning per share were $2.08 as compared to $1.88 for the first nine months of 2013. Year-to-date adjusted net income in 2014 was $474.2 million, up from $433.1 million in the corresponding period a year ago.","Our adjusted operating cash flows during the first nine months of 2014 totaled $1,035 million, which is a $16 million decrease from the same period in 2013. Consistent with prior quarters, we saw stronger operating cash flows, because of higher net income and larger non-cash charges related to depreciation and deferred income taxes.","On the other hand, we experienced an increase in cash needs for working capital, including natural gas and storage. Our total capital expenditures increased by $50 million in the first nine months of 2014 compared to 2013, primarily because of investments in our distribution infrastructure.","We paid $264 million in common dividends in the first nine months of 2014, an increase of $22 million or almost 9% compared to the first nine months of 2013. And I am pleased to report that our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.9% at the end of September. That's the lowest level we've seen since the year 2000. With our announcement of the acquisition of Integrys, we suspended our share repurchase program, and thereby enhanced our cash position.","A reminder, that our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401k plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares for these plans.","Year-to-date retail deliveries of electricity rose by 1.1% as compared to the same period in 2013. Our normalized year-to-date retail deliveries were up 2.1%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw actual residential deliveries decline by 2.1%. But on a normalized basis, residential usage rose by 0.7%.","Across our small commercial and industrial group, we saw year-to-date deliveries up 0.1%, and on a normalized basis they were also up 0.1%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, on a normalized basis, year-to-date deliveries were up by 5.2%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines, we were up 1.7%. Overall, these results are in line with our expectations.","Year-to-date retail natural gas sales were up 13.1% compared to the same period in 2013. On a normalized basis, sales improved by 2.6%. The results from our natural gas delivery business are ahead of our expectations for the year.","Finally, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we are tightening our annual earnings guidance. Our prior guidance was $2.58 to $2.64 a share. Our new guidance is $2.60 to $2.64 a share. Again, our new guidance for 2014 is $2.60 to $2.64 a share. This guidance excludes an estimated $0.05 per share of legal, professional and banking fees associated with the acquisition of Integrys.","And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale Klappa","Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mike Weinstein with UBS.","Mike Weinstein - UBS","A quick question about the election coming up, and the sale of state assets that potentially might happen one day in the future, has this become an election issue at all? People have been using it as a hammer or a nail, any sense?","Gale Klappa","No, not at all, Mike. Good question. Really the entire election has turned on jobs. And on the Governor's track record in terms of job creation and elimination of budget deficits, et cetera, so there has been actually, I haven't heard a single word in any of the campaign material or any of the debates about the potential sale of state-owned power plants, nothing.","Mike Weinstein - UBS","And in terms of the O&M savings this quarter, is a lot of that considered ongoing and will flow-through into the fourth quarter as well?","Gale Klappa","Well, I'll let Pat give his view as well. When you look at the O&M savings quarter-on-quarter, there were two or three things that really stand out. First of all, we had some very positive results from pension expense and healthcare costs. On healthcare costs, this is the first year, you may have heard us mention this before, this is the first year that all of our employees have moved to a high deductible healthcare plan. So we'll see, but we may see some rebound in healthcare expenses in Q4. On pension cost, I think Pat's view is for 2014, that should be a pretty well a permanent-type savings.","Then the third piece in terms of the better performance on O&M, the strong performance on O&M in the quarter, is we did see some operating cost savings from our maintenance on our distribution network, simply because our networks really weren't stressed, given the cool summer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","So I might have missed it. But I just wanted to see if you have any color on the issues that you are getting from the Michigan Governor and political people related to the merger transaction? They are filing at FERC and delay in schedule. I mean it seems like it relates to the Upper Peninsula issues. Could you just talk about potential solutions for that?","Gale Klappa","I would be happy to, and thanks for asking, Steve. First of all, I think you've really nailed the principle concern. The principle concern from the Governor's office and the State Attorney General's office at Michigan really relates to the power supply problems and the energy future for the Upper Peninsula, and that is first and foremost on their minds. Right, that's point number one.","Our point number two, it's becoming very, very clear, it's been clear for a while to us, but it's, I think becoming very clear to all the parties in Michigan that the customer choice law there is deeply flawed, particularly when it allows 90% customer choice in one area of the state and kept at 10% customer choice in the rest of the states. And of course, 90% customer choice in the UP makes long-term capacity planning very, very difficult. So that I think is emerging as a very significant issue.","And then, thirdly, there has been a lot of very productive and positive discussion emerging with the lead of the Governor's office about what they call a global solution to the UP energy problems. Yesterday, as a matter of fact, there was a very well attempted Energy Summit hosted in Marquette, Michigan, about the UP issues. And the Governor's senior aide mentioned that she was very encouraged about the positive discussions going on among the parties, and hopeful that a solution could emerge in the near timeframe of the next 60 to 90 days.","So we're very actively involved in those discussions. The only thing I really can add to that is that I think clearly the preference of the administration is building additional generation in the UP. And we have indicated we would be willing to be an investor, as part of that solution. Is that helpful, Steve?","Steven Fleishman - Wolfe Research","And then on the Governor election, I mean, obviously don't know who's going to win. But in the event there were to be a change in Governor in Wisconsin, how does that impact the Commission at all? Do they -- I mean their terms are still for a while, right?","Gale Klappa","Absolutely. In fact, really for the near-term and even in the medium-term, I would see really no change at the Commission. Chairman Montgomery, I believe has five years left on his six-year term; Commissioner Nowak has a very long period left on her six-year term; Commissioner Callisto, who is the prior Governor's appointee, his term expires in March of 2015. Of course, that seat would be appointed one way or another by the new Governor.","But in terms of the two Governor Walker appointees on the Commission, they have very long periods left in their term. So I would really see no change in philosophy or approach of the Commission, regardless of which candidate wins. I will say everybody has been waiting with bated breath here for the latest poll.","The polling firm that has been doing regular -- Marquette University, doing regular polling on the Governor's race and was actually the most accurate polling result from the Governor's recall race, a couple of years ago, literally just released the final poll before the election, about 15 minutes ago. And I'm told it shows Governor Walker up 50 to 43 among likely voters. So that would be a very big swing. It showed a tie just two weeks ago.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","Just curious, what were the drivers or what enabled you to beat your initial third quarter guidance of $0.48 to $0.52? Was it the lower O&M due to the less stressed network, or is there anything else going on?","Gale Klappa","Probably three things going on. Certainly lower O&M due to less stress on the network was a factor. Truth of the matter is even though it's not a big gas quarter -- or not a big quarter for gas sales, our natural gas distribution sales came in better than expected, that was a help; medical expenses better than expected; and then September weather, while it was still cooler than normal was much closer to normal than July and August, and all those factors combined together to bring in numbers that were better than our own expectations.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann","And then just remind us of where the state stands in their evaluation of the state-owned generation asset sale process?","Gale Klappa","Really no significant update from what we provided to you in the past. Everybody has been focused on the election. And as I've mentioned before, if Governor Walker wins the election, I suspect there will be some movement by the state since they've already hired a financial advisor to advice them on state asset sales. I would expect you would see some movement in 2015, if Mary Burke, the Democratic candidate wins. We are really uncertain as to whether she would pursue any sale of state assets.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","I wanted to follow-up on a few things. First of all, on the Michigan stuff. There was a letter, as you know, that was sent to FERC. And they seemed to indicate among other things; this is from the Michigan Governor and what have you, that they saw some sort of conflict between ATC and generation. And they seem to allude to the idea that if there was a generation solution there may not be as big a need for a transmission investment. Can you address that at all? If you guys were to invest in generation would that, do you think impact the CapEx for ATC or something like that?","Gale Klappa","Well, let me frame it a little bit, then I'm going to ask Allen to give you his view as well, since Allen has been deeply involved in all of this, as have I. I think first, it's important to realize that the real concerns from the Michigan Governor's office and the Michigan Attorney General's office, the best we can tell and in our discussions with them, their real concerns are what I mentioned earlier.","They are concerned about the future energy supply in the UP. It's a difficult situation up there as you know given customer choice, given the fact that the Presque Isle units need environmental control upgrades. And then there are lot of moving pieces, but I think that it's becoming clear that a very significant part of the longer term solution is new generation. And we have expressed a willingness to be an investor.","Now clearly, if new generation is built that would mean less transmission will have be built; whether or not new generation alone would be sufficient to eliminate transmission upgrades, that's still to be decided. But clearly, an important part of the equation I think, Allen, is new generation.","Allen Leverett","Yes. I think, Paul, I guess your question also goes to, if I understand it, with the magnitude of transmission required would be less if you had additional generation in the UP. And I think our view would be that, yes, if you had generation up there, you'd certainly need less in the way of transmission upgrades. But I would emphasize less as opposed to actually being able to eliminate the need for any transmission upgrades.","So it's not something I could quantify for you today, but I would say you sort of have two options. One is a pure transmission solution, which we don't think is a good option. The other is really a generation solution coupled with a greatly reduced amount of transmission, but I don't see an option, Paul, where there is no additional transmission investment at all.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And then just with respect to the potential investment in new generation up there, is that possible that that would be part of the Cliffs investigation they are doing with Invenergy for a combined heat plants or is that probably something separate?","Gale Klappa","No. At the moment, there's lots of discussions going on and lot of ideas on the table, and a lot of cooperation among the parties and that's really about all I can tell you at this point.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","You mentioned 60 to 90 days being mentioned as it is wrapping it up, but do you think we might hear anything in the near-term or nearer-term regarding progress on this issue?","Gale Klappa","My guess is, and I'm simply guessing, because again a number of parties are at the table, lot of discussions going on. My guess is the most definitive statements will come either yearend or shortly thereafter.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And then finally, just a follow-up on Mike's question on the O&M and your answer about the high-deductible plan. You said that there might be a rebound in the fourth quarter. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on that? Is that because people have spent their deductible or is something else going on?","Gale Klappa","No. That's exactly it. We suspect that many people would have met their deductible by Q4. And therefore we might see slightly higher medical cost expenses in Q4 than when we were under a more traditional healthcare plan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","One easy question for you. When you talk about the need for capacity in the UP, roughly how much in terms of megawatt capacity are we talking about? And are we simply just talking about gas-fired capacity replacing coal or is it conceivable there is a little more diversity in the fuel mix there?","Gale Klappa","Well, let me answer the second question first and then we'll get Allen's view on the capacity, because a number of different configurations could emerge. So I'm not sure we can give you a precise number on capacity. I would think, based on all the discussions so far, that a principal solution will be natural gas fired capacity probably combined-cycle natural gas plant. However, there is also discussion about augmenting that with some renewables. Again, lots of discussion on the table right now, but I would think the primary thrust would involve new natural gas combined-cycle capacity. Allen?","Allen Leverett","Yes. And I would say, Michael, in terms of amount of capacity, my view would be the amount of capacity required will be somewhere between 250 megawatts and 350 megawatts. But given the nature of the situation there, you'd have to configure that in a way, I mean for example, if there were combined-cycle, you'd probably want more than two trains, you'd probably want three trains, so that multiple CTs, multiple heat recovery steam generators, so that should be able to maintain them in a fashion that allows you to maintain the reliability in the UP. But my guess on range of capacity is in that 250 to 350 range.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","And Allen, as long as I've got you, any update in terms of the multi-value project analysis that the Midwest ISO goes through in terms of evaluating all significant potential new transmission projects in that RTO, not just ones dealing with the UP?","Allen Leverett","No, not really. MISO continues with their current process. They have all the different appendices. I think they go from A to B, in terms of the way that they look at the projects and they evaluate the projects. So there is really no update, Michael, I'm sorry, that I could offer.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Charles Fishman with Morningstar.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Can I burden you with one more question on Michigan's comments concerning the merger? They were also, the Governor and AG were a little concerned about the ownership percentage that you'll have in ATC. And it made me think that are you also at risk by maintaining that higher a level of ownership or at least ATC at risk of losing their independence incentive ROE that they received from FERC? And could that be another potential driver that might, obviously, the simple solution is just to divest a small piece of ATC if you need to, but I'll leave it at that and let you comment.","Gale Klappa","The short answer on independence is no; no danger. And I'll let Allen give you the details.","Allen Leverett","Yes. But I guess on the independence point, Charles, at this point there is only one transmission company that FERC deems being capital I, independent, and that's ITC. So at this point they don't deem it to be independent anyway. So the fact that you have this merger is not going to change anything about that. But I do think, Charles, and I'm glad you asked a follow-up question, because I think a distinction here is very, very important.","ATC is a member of MISO. And as such, they transfer control over their transmission facilities to MISO. So look, as a consequence, regardless of what entities are deemed to control ATC, ATC's transmission facilities are going to be under the control of MISO and nothing about the merger is going to change that fact. And the FERC has held on a number of occasions, at least three, that I am aware of that mergers of utilities that even own directly transmission facilities that are under the control of an RTO, don't raise any vertical market power concerns.","And here there is only indirect ownership by us and Integrys of the transmission facilities. We don't even directly own them, ATC owns them. We won't control ATC. And ATC has ceded over control of the transmission to MISO. So it's a little hard for us to see how this merger presents any concerns as it relates to transmission.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Well, that sounds like a good response, and I assume that will be in your rebuttal testimony.","Gale Klappa","It already is.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","Was about already, the rebuttal on that?","Gale Klappa","It's filed yesterday.","Allen Leverett","Yes. Our answer, it was filed yesterday, Charles.","Charles Fishman - Morningstar","I didn't read it yet.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","It sounds as though, even if you participate in the UP generation solution, it's not going to change your comments around equity needs.","Gale Klappa","No, it will not change our comments on our equity needs. You are absolutely correct.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","And then one of the reasons you gave for your beat was that you had normal weather in September?","Gale Klappa","We had closer to normal weather in September. July and August were 18 standard deviations off the norm, and I am only slightly exaggerating. But we had basically assumed in our guidance, we would have an abnormally cool summer for all three months of the quarter. July and August certainly met our expectations for coolness. September, while below normal, was closer to normal.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","So you extrapolated July across the entire quarter?","Gale Klappa","Well, actually extrapolated June across the entire quarter.","Gale Klappa","All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you again for participating. If you have any other questions, Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations office. And that direct line is 414-221-2592.

In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.","Gale Klappa","Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar yea 2018. First, I would like to make sure that everyone is familiar with the recent changes we made at the most senior level of our organization. The Board of Directors has approved the creation of the Office of the Chair, staffed by for company veterans. We will work together as a team to write the next chapter of our companies growth and service to customers.","As of February 1, my title changed to Executive Chairman. I have agreed to stay in this role for the next three years. And as Executive Chair, I will take the lead on Board governance, corporate strategy, investor relations and economic development.","I am also delighted that Kevin Fletcher has been promoted to Chief Executive. Kevin is a member of the Office of the Chair and will serve on the WEC Energy Group Board of Directors. Kevin will continue to report directly to me and his main focus will be the direction and performance of our seven customer facing utilities.","In addition, the Office of the Chair includes Rick Kuester. Rick continues to serve as Senior Executive Vice President. He will have broad responsibility for the company's capital investment plan, information technology and power generation.","Last but not least, Scott Lauber. Scott has been named Senior Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer. He will be responsible for all of our finance related functions.","This team, as you know, has delivered industry leading results over many years with a clear commitment to reliability, customer satisfaction and shareholder value. Our focus remains on the fundamentals of our business and on developing the next generation of leadership for our company.","And now, I would like to introduce the members of our management team who are here in the room with us today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer, Bill Guc, our Controller, Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations and of course, Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO of WEC Energy Group.","Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full-year 2018 earnings of $3.34 a share. Overall, we are very pleased with our performance during this past year. On virtually every meaningful measure, we made significant progress. We delivered solid earnings and dividend growth. We reached milestones in network reliability, customer satisfaction and company support. We made significant strides upgrading the natural gas infrastructure in Chicago and building a long-term solution for the power supply in Michigan's Upper Peninsula.","We were again named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in America by Corporate Responsibility magazine and we made real progress in reducing our carbon dioxide emissions. In fact, we are on track to exceed our goal of 40% reduction below 2005 levels by the year 2030. Now we expect to achieve that goal by 2023. And we have set our sights on an 80% reduction by the year 2050. Last year alone, we retired nearly 1,500 megawatts of older less efficient coal fired generation. All-in-all, the company continues to perform at a very high level.","During 2018, we also identified several promising investments in our infrastructure segment. On December 28, we acquired an 80% interest in the Coyote Ridge Wind Farm that's located in Brookings County, South Dakota. This wind farm is currently being built by Avangrid Renewables and is expected to be in service before the end of 2019. Coyote Ridge will consist of 39 turbines with a capacity of roughly 97 megawatts. We expect to invest approximately $145 million for our 80% share of the wind farm.","Unique to this transaction, we will be entitled to 99% of the tax benefits. We paid $60 million in December with the final payment coming due after commercial operation is achieved. Under the tax rules, we expect the wind farm to qualify for production tax credits and for 100% bonus depreciation. The project has a 12 year offtake agreement with Google, Google Energy LLC, for all of the energy produced.","Now for a quick update on our previously announced investment in the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center. As you recall, in late June, we announced an agreement to acquire 80% in the Bishop Hill II wind farm located in Henry County, Illinois. We closed on that acquisition in late August. Then this past December, we took advantage of an opportunity to increase our equity interest. We now have a 90% ownership interest in Bishop Hill III. As a reminder, this wind farm was developed by Invenergy and was placed into service in May of 2018. It consists of 53 turbines with a capacity of 132 megawatts. In total, our investment is $166 million. The project has a very long-term 22-year offtake agreement with one of our current wholesale customers, WPPI Energy. WPPI, of course, is based here in Wisconsin and has 51 member utilities.","Turning quickly now to our investment in the Upstream Wind Energy Center. On August 20, we received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to purchase an 80% ownership interest in the upstream project. We closed on this transaction just about a month ago on January 10 at a purchase price of $276 million. As a reminder, Upstream is located in Antelope County, Nebraska and consists of 81 turbines with a capacity of approximately 200 megawatts. The project has a long-term 10-year offtake agreement with an affiliate of Allianz, which is an A-rated publicly traded company.","We are very encouraged about these investments in renewable energy. We expect the return on these investments to be higher than our regulated returns and specifically we are projecting an unlevered internal rate of return above 8% or in the mid-teens on a levered basis. And we are projecting returns on equity based on a 50-50 capital structure at or above our retail returns. I would remind everyone though that these infrastructure investments make up just a small piece of our overall five-year capital plan. As you know, we have a tax appetite and we are being very selective as we vet future projects. We are only interested in projects that do not change our risk profile and achieve our financial returns.","We are also making progress on our quest to add utility-scale solar generation to our portfolio of regulated assets. To refresh your memory, on May 31, 2018, our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary, along with Madison Gas and Electric, filed a joint application with the Wisconsin Commission to purchase 300 megawatts of solar generation at two locations right here in Wisconsin. The Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in southwestern part of the state in Iowa County and will be developed by Invenergy.","The Two Creeks solar project will be located in the City of Two Rivers in northeastern Wisconsin and actually that's near the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant. The Two Creeks project is being developed by NextEra. Our Wisconsin Public Service company will own 100 megawatts at each site. We have an expected investment of approximately $260 million. We expect a decision from the Wisconsin Commission in March or early April. And with regulatory approval, the projects could be in commercial service by the end of 2020. As many of you know, over the past few years, utility-scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices have dropped by nearly 70%, making it a cost-effective option now for our customers, the option that also fits well with our summer peak demand curve and with our plan to significantly reduced carbon dioxide emissions.","In addition, we recently received approval from the Wisconsin Commission for two renewable energy pilot programs. The Solar Now program, as we call it and the dedicated renewable energy resource pilot could bring another 185 megawatts of clean solar and wind energy to our regulated portfolio of assets. And the solar now program will provide us with valuable insights into operating distributed generation.","And now let's switch gears for a bit and take a look at the economy in our region. Wisconsin's published unemployment rate has been 3% or lower since February of last year. And folks, that's the longest stretch of near full employment in state history. The state continues also to witness significant economic development. For example, just in November, Amazon announced plans for a new state-of-the-art fulfillment center in Oak Creek, a suburb of Milwaukee. Amazon plans to invest $200 million in the project, a 2.6 million square feet facility on 75 acres. Amazon expects to employ 1,500 workers at this site. Distribution center is scheduled to open in early 2020 and will feature state-of-the-art robotics to pack, pick and ship small items to customers.","And looking just a few miles further south of Milwaukee, Foxconn has made tangible progress on its high-tech manufacturing and research campus. So far, Foxconn has invested $200 million in Wisconsin. They have moved four million cubic yards of dirt so far in the construction of the Wisconn Valley Science & Technology Park. The first building on the campus is now complete. It's a 120,000 square foot multipurpose building. To date, more than 1,000 jobs have been created in support of the project. And Foxconn has also expanded its presence across the state, buying buildings in Green Bay and Eau Claire and Racine, buildings that are expected to become Foxconn Innovation Centers.","In addition, we are beginning to see the positive ripple effect that we expected with multiple commercial and industrial announcements spring economic growth within just a few miles of the Foxconn campus. As you know, over the past few weeks, there has been a good deal of speculation about Foxconn's future plans for Wisconsin. Just a few days ago, Foxconn issued a clarifying statement noting that its plans do include a fabrication plant and filling 13,000 jobs. But a number of you have asked, whether a potential change in direction by Foxconn could impact the growth we are forecasting or our capital spending plans. The short answer is, we have remained very conservative in our projections. In fact, we weren't projecting a significant ramp up from Foxconn until 2023.","And now, I will turn the call over to Kevin for some additional insight on our operations and our regulatory calendar for 2019. Kevin, all yours.","Kevin Fletcher","Thank you Gale. First, I have some good news to share. Our largest subsidiary, We Energies, was named the most reliable electric utility in the Midwest for the eighth year running. That's a testament to our employees and our focus on building and maintaining resilient infrastructure. And our employees did an excellent job keeping our customers warm during the polar vortex last month. We hit record peaks for natural gas distribution our Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan service territories. In addition, we achieved the highest customer satisfaction ratings in the nation in JD Power Survey of large business and industrial customers served by electric utilities across the country. We also were named by Forbes magazine as one of America's best employers for diversity for 2019.","Now I would like to briefly review where we stand in our four state jurisdictions. As we look ahead in Wisconsin, we plan to file a general rate case for all of our Wisconsin utilities this spring. We would expect that new retail rates would go into affect in January 2020. As a reminder, customers have benefited from a base rate freeze for the past four years and more recently from tax reform. In fact, after factoring in our fuel cost and federal tax reform, our retail rates in Wisconsin are actually lower today than they were in 2015.","Turning to Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Plan. As a reminder, this program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe and reliable. For many years to come, we will be replacing outdated natural gas piping, some of which was installed more than a century ago with state-of-the-art materials. This past year, we invested approximately $295 million in the effort and we expect the project to continue through 2035.","And now a word about our Minnesota utility, Minnesota Energy Resources. On December 26 of last year, the Commission approved a rate increase of $3.1 million or 1.26% effective January 1, 2018. The order also increased the equity ratio to 50.9% and the allowed return on equity to 9.7%. The Minnesota Attorney General has requested a review of the authorized ROE in the order.","Now we will turn to Michigan. We are nearing completion of the new natural gas-fired generation in the upper Peninsula. Engineering, procurement and construction are essentially complete. Startup as well underway and we anticipate commercial operation as planned in the second quarter of this year. And at that time or soon thereafter, we will expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle.","We are investing $266 million in 10 reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them RICE units. They will be capable of generating a total of 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by one of our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost effective long-term power supply for the customers in the upper Peninsula.","And with that, I will turn it back to Gale.","Gale Klappa","Kevin, thank you very much. The new year is off to a strong start. We are on track to meet our 2019 guidance. If you recall, that's in the range of $3.48 a share to $3.52 a share. This guidance translates to a growth rate between 6.1% and 7.3% of our 2018 base of $3.28 a share. Recall that the $3.28 was the midpoint of our original guidance for 2018.","And finally, a word about our dividend policy. At this January meeting, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $0.59 per share. That's an increase of 6.8% over the previous rate. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.36 a share. This will mark the 16th consecutive year that our company will reward our shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We are smack dab in the middle of that range now. So I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.","And now with details on our 2018 results and our outlook for 2019 is our famous CFO, Scott Lauber. Scott?","Scott Lauber","Thanks Gale. Our 2018 GAAP earnings were $3.34 per share compared to $3.79 per share in 2017. The 2017 results included the impact of tax reform on the company's non-utility assets and assets of the parent company. Excluding this deferred tax benefit, our 2017 adjusted earnings were $3.14 per share. Comparable results for 2018 were $3.34 per share with no adjustments. This represents an increase of $0.20 per share or 6.4% over adjusted earnings for 2017. For rest of my presentation, I will refer exclusively to adjusted earnings for 2017.","Our solid 2018 results were largely driven by additional capital investment, effective cost control and higher sales volumes. Earnings benefited from both warmer than normal summer weather and colder than normal winter across all of our jurisdictions. The favorable weather coupled with economic growth drive energy use significantly above our forecasts.","The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of fourth quarter and full year 2018 and 2017 results. My focus will be on the full year, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes.","Referring to page 13 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2018 was $1,468 million as compared to operating income of $1,776 million in 2017, a decrease of $308 million. Excluding two tax items, operating income actually increased by $88 million. We have a breakout of these items for your reference on page 9 and 10 of the earnings package.","Recall that as part of our Wisconsin settlement, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. That plan continues to proceed as expected. We now project that the transmission escrow balance","[AUDIO GAP]","Excludes the impact of the tax items.","Starting with the Wisconsin segment. The increase in operating income, net of tax adjustments was $53.1 million. Higher sales volumes drove a $92.1 million increase in margins. This was partially offset by $28.1 million increase in depreciation expense and a $7.4 million increase in operations and maintenance expense. The increase in O&M expense was largely driven by two items.","The first item was a $7 million expense related to staff reductions as we continue to streamline process and reshape our generation portfolio. Second, we accrued $64.6 million more in 2018 related to the earnings sharing mechanism we have in place at our Wisconsin Utilities. This was a result of our strong performance in 2018. Excluding these two items, operations and maintenance expense actually decreased $64.2 million driven by the closing of coal plants and effective cost control across the business.","In Illinois, operating income increased $5.4 million net of tax adjustments. The increase was primarily driven by our continued investment in the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. Excluding the impact of tax reform, operating income at our other states segment increased $22.4 million. Higher sales volumes resulting from colder winter weather and customer growth drove a $10 million increase year-over-year. We also benefited from an increase in revenues to the Minnesota rate case. Recall that interim rates have been in place since January 1, 2018. The remaining increase of $4.8 million was attributable to a favorable judgment received on a property tax matter.","Turning now to our energy infrastructure segment. Excluding the impact of tax reform, operating income at this segment was up $15.7 million. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30, 2017, contributed $13.6 million to the increase in operating income. The remaining increase was driven by additional investments at our Power the Future plan. The results also reflect the acquisition of our interest in Bishop Hill in the fall 2018. Recall that a portion of the earnings from this facility come in the form of production tax credits and is recognized as an offset to income tax expense.","The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased by $8.3 million. The change is primarily due to impairment recorded on some nonregulated assets that we inherited from the Integrys acquisition. Combining these changes and excluding the two tax items I discussed, operating income increased $88 million. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $136.7 million, a decrease of $17.6 million as compared to 2017. Excluding the impact from the tax reform, our equity earnings increased by $16.7 million.","Higher earnings were driven by continued capital investment and the absence of a FERC audit expense that was recorded in 2017. Other income net decreased by $3.4 million year-over-year. Our net interest expense increased $29.4 million, primarily driven by higher debt balances related to our continued capital investment and slightly higher interest rates.","Our adjusted consolidated income tax expense decreased $420 million. As previously discussed, lower tax expense was driven by the impact of tax reform and the flow through of tax repairs. The effective tax rate was 13.8% in 2018. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, our effective tax rate would have been 24%. Looking forward to 2019, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 10.5% and 11.5%. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, we expect our 2019 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. We are projecting a lower rate in 2019 because of production tax credits from our infrastructure investments. We now expect to be a partial taxpayer in 2020.","Looking now at the cash flow statement at page 8 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $367 million during 2018. Stronger earnings contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities. Our capital expenditures were actually $2.1 billion for 2018, $156 million increase from 2017, reflecting continued investment in our core business. In 2018, our FFO to debt was 20.7% due to strong cash flow as previously discussed. Looking forward, we continue to expect FFO to debt to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We paid $697 million in common dividends during 2018, an increase of $41 million over 2017 which reflect the increase to the annualized dividend level in 2018.","Turning now to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of 2018, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 19,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on pages 16 and 17 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 2.6% from 2017 and on a weather normalized basis, retail deliveries were up 1.2%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 9.1% versus 2017. This excludes gas used for power generation. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 4.3% on a weather normalized basis. Overall electric and natural gas volumes were above our expectations for 2018.","And I will briefly touch on our 2019 sales forecast for the state of Wisconsin, our largest segment. We are forecasting a slight increase of 0.3% in weather normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mine. We project Wisconsin weather normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase by 0.8%.","And finally, let's look at the first quarter of 2019 guidance. In the first quarter last year, we earned $1.23 per share. The first quarter of 2018 was helped by approximately $0.04 of positive fuel recoveries related to market conditions. Taking this factor into account, we project first quarter 2019 earnings to be in a range of the $1.23 per share to $1.25 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.","With that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale Klappa","Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we are on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. I might add, the Milwaukee Bucks have the best record in the NBA. So, operator, we are ready to rock and open it up now for the question-and-answer portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Gale Klappa","Good afternoon, Praful. How are you? How are you today?","Praful Mehta","Good. Thank you for taking the question. And I appreciate your comments on Foxconn. I wouldn't get into that because you have already addressed it on the call. I wanted to get a little bit more specific in terms of that cash tax comment that you made earlier and the fact that you will become partial cash taxpayer in 2020. I was looking at the cash flow statement and there is a meaningful deferred tax addback right now that is benefiting cash flows and operating cash flows. How does that cash flow get impacted as you move towards more of being a cash taxpayer? And does that mean any pressure on your credit metrics in that 2020, 2021 timeframe?","Gale Klappa","Well, a great question and I will ask Scott to address it. First of all, though, just to kind of frame the answer in context for you. We are saying now that we are projecting to be a partial cash taxpayer in 2020, but that assumes no additional investments in the infrastructure segment that would provide in essence additional tax credits. So that's a snapshot in time today just taking into account the infrastructure investments that we have already announced.","Scott?","Scott Lauber","Yes. That's exactly it, Gale. And when you look at it, if you look at the cash flow statement, the cash flow statement is never as straightforward as you would hope. There is a lot of different pieces. The money we are saving on taxes, some of it is flowing against regulatory assets, et cetera. So we didn't pay cash taxes in 2017 or 2018 and right now we don't expect in 2019. And like Gale said, a partial in 2020. So, some of these cash taxes, the deferred taxes, that's a long unwind as we look across it as we work into a rate case.","Gale Klappa","Some of that unwind goes out 15 to 20 years.","Praful Mehta","Got it. So you don't foresee in the 2021 timeframe any pressure on credit that would, given your high growth and your investment, is there any kind of need for equity is what I am trying to get that, I guess, through the credit question?","Scott Lauber","No. And that's why we are being very diligent on these infrastructure projects that pushes out to 2020 now.","Gale Klappa","But no additional plans for equity. Period, end of story.","Praful Mehta","Okay. Great. Always good to clarify. I guess, the other question I wanted to get was, you had this slide where you talked about load growth and this was in your January update. And you seemed to have like a higher load growth projection on slide 25 of that deck in that 2022, 2023 timeframe of 1.2% to 1.5%, both on the electric and gas side. Just wanted to understand what's driving that increase? Is it the industrial load that you are seeing? Or is it something else that is driving that load growth? And how would that correlate to the 5% to 7% growth that you are talking about more generally on the earnings side?","Gale Klappa","Okay. Great question. Let me try to give the two or three pieces to the answer. And the first is that I mentioned that we are already seeing a significant amount of ripple effect economic development, partially from the Foxconn investments that are going on. But also, if you recall, we have had other major investments announced just in the last 24 months. In addition to Foxconn, the German candy manufacturer, Haribo is coming in with one of the largest confectionery plants in North America. They are going to be breaking ground later this year. So we will see some uptick from that development later on in our forecast period.","I mentioned Amazon, which will be cranking up in late 2020. Milwaukee Electric Tool is just adding another huge expansion. And then in the fall this past year, we announced. Komatsu, a major mining manufacturing company is going to build a huge manufacturing complex just south of downtown Milwaukee in the Harbor District. When you put that together with the other economic development projects that some smaller also very meaningful that we are already seeing in the pipeline and have been announced and those factors are driving an uptick in our projection of sales growth for the latter part of this five-year forecast period.","Scott, anything to add to that?","Scott Lauber","No. That's exactly it. It takes a while because these are just starting construction.","Gale Klappa","And all of that will still, we believe, keep us in that 5% to 7% earnings per share growth.","Praful Mehta","Got you. That's great. Much appreciated, guys. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Gale Klappa","Afternoon, Michael. How are you doing today?","Michael Weinstein","Good. How are you doing?","Gale Klappa","We are sitting here and stuck in a snow belt. Have got a foot of snow out there.","Michael Weinstein","I had a question about the infrastructure business. I think in the past you said you wanted to grow that to about 3% of the total asset base. Could you just remind us what is the goal and timeframe for that goal and where you stand now versus that goal?","Gale Klappa","Well, what we talked about really when we said about 3% of the asset base is that it's a small percentage of our total five-year capital plan. So in the five-year capital plan, in essence, we have got about just over $1 billion budgeted for this particular segment of capital spending. Basically, the one we just announced, the Coyote Ridge project, is the project that would have been a 2019 project, that's already done. We already have the contracts signed. The project will come in line. We come online, we believe, towards the end of 2019. So we are a good ways along with Bishop Hill, with the Upstream and with Coyote Ridge. We are, I would say, about 40% toward that goal, Scott?","Scott Lauber","Yes. Gale, you are exactly right. We have all the projects announced that we have in our capital spending through 2019 already. And right now, we are looking at 3% was really in the five-year plan that we were talking. And remember, we really look at that Bluewater Gas Storage as really extension of our Wisconsin business, because these are all Wisconsin utilities.","Gale Klappa","And Michael, as I have mentioned to you, we can be, given our competitive advantage, with our tax appetite, with the strength of our balance sheet and our ability to use the production tax credits, we are in a very competitive position. So as we set future projects, we have a very really robust list of future projects to choose from. And as I mentioned, we will be very selective. We are only going to invest in this segment in projects that we have an incredibly high confidence level in terms of not changing our risk profile but with offtake agreements with some of the best, most robust companies in the country.","Michael Weinstein","Right. Understood. In fact, I think if I recall, you had previously said as being non cash taxpayer through 2019 now through the end of 2019. This is a slightly extended period, right? But you are going to be a noncash taxpayer?","Gale Klappa","That's exactly correct. So as soon as we announced the last deal here, that moved us to 2020.","Michael Weinstein","Okay. So I mean, the lack of the ability of these projects to avoid equity reduces, as long as they are not harming the credit rating or putting pressure on the balance sheet in any kind of way, are really at a lower cost of capital, right?","Gale Klappa","That actually, in an interesting way, they are helpful to our FFO to debt calculation because of the bonus depreciation. Obviously, the cash comes back from these investments very, very quickly.","Michael Weinstein","Right, understood. All right. Thank you very that much.","Gale Klappa","Great. Thank you Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides","Hi guys. Thanks for taking my question. And congrats so far on your Milwaukee Bucks. We will see. Season has got a long way to go.","Gale Klappa","We just got the big dude from your Pelicans.","Michael Lapides","You know what. Let's not go there. As a Grizzlies fan originally and turned into a Pelicans fan, I am just in depression land when it comes to the NBA right now. And I live in New York, which makes it even worse. Real quick, where do you think you are tracking for the next one or two years on your CapEx plan original target that you laid out around the EEI timeframe? Do you think you are tracking ahead? Do you think you are tracking in line? Do you think you are tracking below? And it's different than where you originally laid out. I know it's not been very long since you put that out there. But if it's different, where and how?","Gale Klappa","No, I think it's a good question, Michael. And I think the honest answer is, we are exactly where we thought we would be in terms of the capital spending plan over the five-year period. We are on track. The projects we had identified for 2019, they are all underway. Again, remember we refreshed our capital plan back in October, November. Very little has changed. We are right on target where we want to be.","Kevin? Scott?","Scott Lauber","Probably the only one is our last announcement on the infrastructure which filled in our 2019 bucket. So we are going to be more selective as we go forward.","Gale Klappa","Yes. But in terms of all of our regulated capital spending plans, right on target. Everything is exactly as we hope they would be.","Michael Lapides","Got it. And another question. I know no one likes to litigate rate cases on earnings conference calls. But as we think about this year from a regulatory construct and past perspective, is there anything else to think about besides the Wisconsin rate cases? And do you see these rate cases as being significant items in the course of the company? Would you see these relative to historical trends or other companies in the state or the region as being kind of less urgent or less impactful relative to what you see elsewhere around the U.S.?","Gale Klappa","Oh gosh. compared what we see elsewhere around the U.S., rate cases in Wisconsin are generally more genteel, if you will. And as we have said, we would expect the rate filings in Wisconsin this year and I will ask Kevin to comment in a second, the rate filings this year to be pretty modest in their asks. So I don't see a ton of drama surrounding these particular rate cases.","Kevin?","Kevin Fletcher","Gale, I would say you summed it very well. We are on the process of evaluating our rate case and our options now. And as you said, I think it would be in line with inflation and nothing major there.","Michael Lapides","Got it. Thank you guys. Much appreciated.","Gale Klappa","You are welcome, Michael. Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. Your line is open.","Gale Klappa","Greetings Michael. How are you doing today?","Michael Sullivan","I am doing great. How are guys all doing?","Gale Klappa","We are doing well.","Michael Sullivan","Great. Maybe just one quick follow-up to start on the rate case side of things. I just wanted to clarify the reason you are filing in Wisconsin is because you were required per the last settlement agreement? Or is there actually is a need would you have filed otherwise anyways?","Gale Klappa","Well, to directly answer your question, there is a specific order point in the last rate agreement, the last rate settlement that requires us to file a rate case, I believe, by the April 2 of 2019. So there is a regulatory requirement. Would we have filed anyway? Maybe, maybe not. But clearly it will be a good time to really, I mean there a number of tweaks that we think will be helpful in terms of rate design, in terms of a number of other accounting issues, et cetera, et cetera. So I don't know that we wouldn't have filed anyway. But it really is a moot point in that there is an order requiring us to file by April.","Michael Sullivan","Okay. Great. And then just a separate one on the O&M side of things, obviously, a pretty big driver again in 2018 for you all. Just curious how we should think about that maybe on a normalized percentage basis? And then maybe what you are targeting for this year on the cost cutting side?","Gale Klappa","Sure. I would be happy to. Let me first explain the backdrop and that is in 2019, we will reap a full year worth of savings from the closure of the Pleasant Prairie Power Plant. Remember, a large coal-fired plant of that kind requires very significant amount of annual operating and maintenance costs. Wisconsin Public Service closed the Pulliam Power Plant. There was a jointly owned unit called Edgewater, a jointly owned with other Wisconsin utilities that closed in the fall as well. And then we expect as and Kevin mentioned the new power supply, the RICE units that should go commercial in the spring of this year and that will allow us to retire the Presque Isle power plant up in the upper Peninsula of Michigan, way up north. You put all of those O&M savings together and we expect another leg down in operation and maintenance costs in 2019 compared to 2018. And Kevin, I am thinking in the 3% to 4% range.","Kevin Fletcher","That's correct. Yes. The ballpark that we are looking at. Very similar to what we did this year.","Gale Klappa","Fine. That's exactly it.","Michael Sullivan","Okay. Great. I appreciate the color.","Gale Klappa","You are welcome.","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. your next question comes from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Your line is open.","Gale Klappa","Rock 'n roll, Vedula.","Vedula Murti","Hi Gale. How are you?","Gale Klappa","I am good. How are you doing?","Vedula Murti","I am okay.","Gale Klappa","Vedula, I always ask you that and I never get wonderful and award-winning.","Vedula Murti","Okay. Wonderful and award-winning, aye.","Gale Klappa","Excellent.","Vedula Murti","Anyway. Let's see, a few things. One, if I am not mistaken, I think I saw something relating to the Illinois gas utilities with the main replacement program that you have been discussing and that the ICC staff may have some issues in terms of some investments or expenses that they have some questions about. Can you just kind of elaborate on that a little bit?","Gale Klappa","Sure. I would be happy to, Vedula. The matter you are referring to relates to the capital investment that was made for the system modernization during calendar year 2015. And if you recall, our acquisition of Integrys, which included the Peoples Gas Company, took place, I think we closed on June 29, 2015. So as the Commission looks at retrospectively the prudency of the program and how it was run, how the investment program was run in 2015, remember we have the company for six months, the prior management had the company for six months. And essentially what the Commission staff is saying is that they don't think the program was run as efficiently as it should have been certainly prior to the acquisition. And that's what the issue is. So we will work our way through that. I am not overly alarmed. It's just a matter of getting through this particular process. And this is an annual review, which is part of the regulatory compact there. So it's something we are very familiar with. But it really relates to the 2015 investment in which we only had six months of operation of Peoples Gas.","Vedula Murti","Does that mean that has 2016 and 2017 already been reviewed and has basically been resolved? Or is there going to be reviewed going forward?","Gale Klappa","It will be reviewed in the future. Right now they are focused on 2015.","Vedula Murti","Okay.","Gale Klappa","But remember, Vedula, we have made very significant improvements in the management of that program.","Vedula Murti","Okay. No, I understand that. My second question kind of ties to what Praful was asking about in terms of the uptick on the sales forecast. To the extent, I understand that it seems to tie into when you would expect a lot of Foxconn and all the ancillaries to basically be pretty much up and running or at a position where they are fully deployed or mature, whatever term you want to use. When I think look at my math, it was about roughly a little over $4 billion, I think, at that time of gross margin between Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, a 1.2% uptick versus underlying is about $40 million to $50 million in terms of gross margin or almost $0.10 a share compounding. So to the extent, just wondering about that potential variability of that sales forecast, given the leverage that it would show in the backend and as it ties into being able to continue the 5% to 7% that you have been able to do?","Gale Klappa","Well, let me take a shot at that and I will also ask Scott to chime in and Kevin, if you have anything as well. First of all, let me reemphasize that the economic growth we are seeing, yes, Foxconn is a significant piece of it but it's a lot more than Foxconn. When you see the growth in the corridor between Milwaukee and Chicago, it is significant, with or without Foxconn. In fact, for example the polar vortex days we had here, just this last week, clearly are pointing to the need for some additional capital in that corridor just for natural gas consumption and reliability without Foxconn consuming one firm today. So my sense is, yes, we are ramping up just a bit our sales forecast for the outer years of the five-year plan. But recall that that will all get factored into rates. So I think you may be and Scott if you will comment on this, I think you may be thinking a little more granularly than you should be about the gross margin impact.","Scott?","Scott Lauber","Yes, when you look at the volumes in that sales forecast, I think when we talked at EEI, these are the larger industrial customers that have come in, the Amazons, the Foxconns, the Haribos that the lower margin when you look at industrial classes, those are the lower margin classes. So the margin isn't quite there. But what we did put in the forecast is really put known projects out there. So we don't know where the additional jobs, that will be additional housing or the secondary suppliers. So we did not add that into the forecast whether it be the capital to put those in or the volumes associated with it. But the volumes here are really shown more in that industrial segment and I would expect in a few years after that would start seeing them in smaller groups, those volumes coming in. But it all does get worked into rate cases that allow us to continue to keep rates where they are at.","Kevin Fletcher","Gale, I would just add that that certainly has been a growth part of our service territory and with that in any economic development project, like you mentioned the multiplier effect is going to be there. So that also is what's factored in as we look forward into the future.","Vedula Murti","Go ahead.","Gale Klappa","I am sorry. And Vedula, to Kevin's point, we have already seen two big announcements about healthcare facilities, hospitals and medical complexes being built within miles of the Foxconn campus. Just last week there was an announcement of a new hotel and a new distribution center and a new brew pub, by the way. So you know, you need to get out here.","Vedula Murti","I will definitely do that in the summertime. One last thing. When you referred to the utility-scale solar, my recollection is that the new Governor is particularly interested in utility-scale solar as part of renewables and I presume that the filing that you are going to have asking for approval is simply step one of a more developed program going forward. I am wondering if you can tell us what your sense is how do you think that program was developed in terms of further utility-scale by rate base solar development?","Gale Klappa","Well, first of all, as you know, one step at the time. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we should receive a Commission decision on the utility-scale solar projects that we have put in front of the Commission for approval. We expect a decision certainly by end of March or early April. Then as we have developed our internal plans, depending upon that approval and I am very optimistic about that, you could see us, as a next step, submitting a request for utility-scale solar for Wisconsin Electric as the one that's in front of the Commission today is for our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary based in Green Bay.","And then I mentioned, we just received approval for a couple of pilot programs that are pretty sizable and it could bring up to 185 megawatts of additional wind and solar to our regulated portfolio. So one step at a time. Wisconsin Public Service approval, up and coming. We trust then we are going to work hard on these two pilot projects that the Commission approved before the end of last year. And, potentially, you will see a filing also for Wisconsin Electric for utility-scale solar.","Vedula Murti","And those are reflected in the five-year forecast for capital and growth?","Gale Klappa","That is absolutely right.","Vedula Murti","Thank can very much.","Gale Klappa","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotia Howard. Your line is open.","Gale Klappa","Afternoon, Andrew. How are you?","Andrew Weisel","Hi. Very good. Thank you. Just a few questions on the regulatory front to elaborate on your comments. You mentioned a little bit of the rate design and tariff things that you may want to reconsider with this upcoming rate case in addition to the revenue increase. Can you elaborate what specifically, as far as rate design, might you be looking to improve? And well, I will leave it there for now. What rate design issues are on your mind?","Gale Klappa","I would just say, watch this space. We are obviously putting final touches together on our plans. But for example, there is a real-time pricing program that the Commission approved couple of years ago that has to get reviewed again. We think that's something that the Commission will take a hard look at and we will have some ideas. So that's one good example. And that's been a very popular program with our larger industrial customers. So that's just one example of a rate design type of an issue that we will have a good discussion with the Commission. But watch this space.","Andrew Weisel","Okay. Fair enough. Then, any changes to the Commission you have seen? It's only not even halfway through February, but with the new Governor and potential changes to the Commission, the staff policies, mentality, anything that you foresee coming up in the rate case that might be a little different than the last few times you have gone through?","Gale Klappa","Well, I think it's pretty clear what areas of emphasis we will be looking at in the rate case and the staff and the Commissioners would be looking at. I think my honest thought at this point is essentially steady as she goes.","Andrew Weisel","Great. Then just last one. I am sorry?","Gale Klappa","No. I was just asking Kevin or Scott if they had any other thoughts.","Kevin Fletcher","No. I agree with that, Gale. Nothing else to add.","Andrew Weisel","Good. Consistent with that will be a good thing in your state. My last question is you have been on a pretty steady two-year cycle for the rate cases as far as filings. Should we see the big pickup in demand with industrial and the trickle down to residential and commercial? Might there be opportunity to have less frequent rate cases? Or do you think this two-year cycle is going to be continuing for the foreseeable future?","Gale Klappa","Well, first of all, remember, we have had a rate freeze for four years. So we really have, in some ways, deviated from the every other year rate case cycle. I will say, historically, the Commission has wanted all of the Wisconsin utilities to file a case every two years. Whether that approach is still something the Commission wants, we will have to see. Because obviously, we will have a new Chair of the Commission here by March and there is a new staff director, et cetera. So I would guess, though, because the Wisconsin Commission has been so consistent in it's approach over the years, I would guess that we probably will continue on an every two-year cycle.","Andrew Weisel","Very good. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Gale Klappa","Hi Paul.","Paul Ridzon","Gale, how are you?","Gale Klappa","We are great. How are you doing?","Paul Ridzon","Just a quick clarification question. You said O&M should be down 3% to 4%. What's the normalized number to bake into that?","Gale Klappa","Well, let's see. I think the day-to-day O&N that we manage, if I remember correctly and Scott, if I am off here, please correct me, that's because it's an easy number to remember, I think, for 2018, our day-to-day O&M expenses totaled $1,234 million, 1-2-3-4. So that's the base on which we are talking about to reduce maybe 3% to 4%.","Scott, am I correct?","Scott Lauber","Yes. You are exactly correct. And we break down the O&M when the 10-K comes out and we break it out into more detail there because there is other items that are regulatory in nature that are amortizations that come to the total number. So what Gale is quoting is that day-to-day O&M.","Paul Ridzon","And I think earlier, can you just review some of the things you said were unusual in the 2018 O&M?","Gale Klappa","Unusual in the 2018 O&M. Well, you have got to think about, there is some confusion about where tax repairs are impacting, that's a biggie.","Scott Lauber","So when you look at the O&M in the earnings packet, you try a breakout how the tax repairs are pulled out of those ahead of it. I think what you are talking about is, we really only had a part of a year of our retirement of the one coal plant in 2018 and now the Pleasant Prairie Coal Plant will have a full year next year. And this year, in the second quarter, we expect that that coal plant in the upper Peninsula, Presque Isle, to close and there should be savings for that. So those are the two unique items we talked about earlier in the call.","Paul Ridzon","There was nothing in sharing?","Scott Lauber","The sharing is a separate line item, correct, the $67 million of sharing this year.","Gale Klappa","Very significant customer benefit to come in 2019 because of the company's performance last year.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you very much.","Gale Klappa","Terrific. Thank you so much. Well, it looks like that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any questions, feel free to call Beth Straka, 414-221-4639. Thanks everybody. Take care.","Operator","This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect."],"21914":["WEC Energy Group, Inc.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Allen Leverett","Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the third quarter of the year. But first I want to introduce the members of our team who are with me here today. Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; Beth Straka, finally, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","So with that let's start with our third quarter 2016 results. We reported adjusted third quarter earnings of $0.69 per share, that compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger related costs. The weather here in Southeastern Wisconsin was the second warmest in 84 years. Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. ","In addition to our third quarter earnings we have two positive developments to share with you. First we reached an uncontested settlement with the Michigan Public Service Commission staff, the Michigan attorney general and other interveners to form a Michigan only utility. This utility will be named the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Company or UMERC for short. We expect UMERC will provide electric and natural gas service to current customers of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. At this point we believe UMERC will begin operations on January 1 of next year. The formation of UMERC is another step that is required to allow us to begin a certificate of necessity proceeding for our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. ","We are proposing a $255 million investment in 170 megawatts of natural gas fired generation. UMERC would own and operate the reciprocating internal combustion engines which would provide a long term generation solution for reliable and low cost power for customers in the upper peninsula, including the mines owned by Cliffs Resources. ","Now we expect to file our proposal with the Michigan commission in November and we're targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time or soon after we expect to be in a position to retire our coal fired Presque Isle power plant. ","The second positive development relates to our earnings outlook. Based on the positive third quarter results largely driven by weather, we now expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Now we only had one ongoing rate case this year. This was our Minnesota gas utilities rate case, very recently received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase is approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million. And this is in line with our expectations for the case. Early next year we will evaluate our rate case plans for all of our utilities.","Next, I want to mention a recent development at the FERC level which impacts our earnings at ATC. On September 28, FERC voted to affirm a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base ROE in the first MISO ROE complaint. Effective January 2015, we qualified for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO member increasing our ROE to 10.82%. The resolution of this first complaint for the period from November of 2013 through February 11 of 2015 resulted in an increase in pretax earnings of approximately $1.4 million. Looking ahead we expect an order in the second quarter of 2017 in the second MISO complaint case where the ALJ recommended a base ROE of 9.7%. Again we qualify for the 50 basis point adder which would increase the recommended ROE to 10.2%. We believe this is an appropriate assumption going forward. ","Now a reminder on our dividend. In January of this year our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 per share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is at approximately the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are in this range now I expect our dividend growth will be in line with our earnings per share growth. ","Finally I want to review our updated five year capital forecast. This plan now reflects a range of $9 billion to $9.5 billion which is $1.6 billion more than the plan we presented at EEI last November. This plan does not include a potential natural gas storage investment that we are continuing to pursue. I would also remind you that these figures do not include ATC\u2019s capital spending plan. ","In addition to the project outlined for you earlier we have continued to identify the need for infrastructure improvements, including our gas facilities in Chicago. We have included updated five year capital investment forecast charts in the back of the earnings package. ","Now with details on our third quarter results and a financial outlook, here is our chief financial officer Scott Lauber. ","Scott Lauber ","Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 third quarter GAAP earnings were $0.68 per share compared with $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015. Third quarter results in both 2016 and 2015 include a full quarter of earnings from the Integrys companies.","Excluding one set of acquisition costs in 2016 adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.11 from $0.58 per share in the third quarter of 2015 to $0.69 per share in the third quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings of $0.61 per share in the third quarter last year.","For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 third quarter earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2015 now includes Integrys earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. ","First I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring page ten of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the third quarter adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys was $402.5 million as compared to $351.8 million in 2015, an increase of $50.7 million.","Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the third quarter totaled $299.1 million for 2016, an increase of $42.5 million from the third quarter of 2015. The improved quarter over quarter results for the Wisconsin segment was driven primarily by significantly warmer than normal weather and timing of positive fuel recoveries. ","In the third quarter of 2016 our Illinois segment had $11.7 million of operating income, an increase of $8.2 million compared to the $3.5 million of operating income recognized during the 2015 third quarter. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by continuing investment in the gas system modernization program.","Operating income for our other states segment improved $2.7 million in part due to cost controls. Operating income at the We Power segment was up $500,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investments at our Power the Future plan.","Our corporate and other segment realized an adjusted operating loss of $1 million this quarter compared to an adjusted operating income of $2.2 million in the third quarter of 2015. Taking the changes of these segments together we arrived at $50.7 million increase in adjusted operating income. ","During the third quarter of 2016 earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.3 million, a decrease of $1.7 million from the same quarter last year. The lower equity earnings were driven by the recent FERC order and ALJ recommendations related to the ATC ROE reviews.","Our other income net decreased by $3.6 million largely related to lower AFUDC which was caused primarily by timing of capital expenditures. Our net interest expense decreased $4.1 million, interest expense decreased quarter over quarter primarily as a result of the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% junior notes earlier this year. Those notes were replaced with lower interest rate short term debt.","Increased quarter over quarter operating income was the primary driver for the $15.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% and 38.5%.","Combining all these items it brings us to adjust to the earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016 compared to $185 million or $0.58 per share for the third quarter of 2015.","On a year to date basis, GAAP earnings were $2.35 per share compared with $1.78 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2015. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.03 per share in 2015 to $2.36 per share in 2016. Year to date results in 2016 include the impacts of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 year to date results include only one quarter of Integrys earnings.","Net cash provided by operating activities increased $647.5 million during the first nine months of 2016. This increase was driven primarily by $526 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by decreasing contributions to employee benefit plans. As previously discussed we contribute $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015 and we did not make a contribution in 2016. ","Our capital expenditures totaled $1 billion during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, a $208.3 million increase compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was related to capital investments at the Integrys companies.","Our debt to capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of September, an increase from the 50.1% adjusted debt to capital ratio reported at the end of June. Effective at the end of the third quarter we no longer are adjusting equity for any portion of the legacy Integrys hybrid instruments. Our calculations continue to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 series A junior subordinate notes at common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward we do not expect to issue any additional shares. ","We also paid $468.6 million in common dividends during the nine months ended September 30, 2016, an increase of $157.7 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition sectors and an increase in the dividend rate compared to the first nine months of 2015. Since the beginning of 2015 we increased our quarterly dividend 17.2% from $0.4225 per share to the current level of $0.495 per share.","Moving to sales, we continued to see customer growth across our system. At the end of September our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7000 more electric customers and nearly 13,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are serving approximately 18,000 more customers compared to a year ago.","Now let's discuss delivered volumes. For comparative purposes year to date electric volume information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather normalized deliveries are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Actual third quarter retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased 4.1%. On a weather normalized basis retail deliveries of electricity were flat compared to the third quarter of 2015.","Looking at the individual customer segments, actual residential deliveries rose 8.1% while weather normalized residential deliveries decreased five-tenths of 1%. Across our small commercial industrial group, actual deliveries increased 3.6% while weather normalized quarterly deliveries increased seven-tenths of 1%.","In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2016 increased 2.2%. Excluding the iron ore mine, large commercial industrial deliveries increased eight-tenths of 1%. We see continued improvement in several important sectors of Wisconsin\u2019s economy, including paper and paper products, food processing and chemical processing. Year to date weather normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines, increased three-tenths of 1%. ","Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, year to date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas use for power generation, decreased 3% compared to the same period in 2015 due primarily to warmer weather. On a weather normalized basis, year to date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas use for power generation, were up 2.8%. Overall our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. ","Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. The guidance excludes a $0.01 per share of acquisition related costs in the third quarter as well as any potential acquisition related cost that may arise during the fourth quarter. This projection assumes normal weather for the balance of the year and reflects the mild first quarter weather as well as a very warm third quarter weather conditions.","A couple of key points as we look at the annual guidance. First, the very warm weather in the third quarter was mainly in southeatern Wisconsin and the majority of the weather related margins and positive fuel recoveries were in the Wisconsin electric service territory. This was a benefit to Wisconsin electric in the third quarter of about $0.08. As you recall Wisconsin electric and Wisconsin gas have an earning sharing mechanism in place as part of the acquisition order and therefore limit the overall earnings potential for the year. In addition we expect an increase in maintenance expense items in the fourth quarter compared to last year. Again we expect our 2016 earnings to be at the upper end of our $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share guidance range. ","With that, I will turn things back to Allen. ","Allen Leverett","Thank you, Scott. Now before we take your questions I want to take a moment to thank Colleen Henderson for her 21 years of dedicated service to the company. Now it's been my pleasure to work with Colleen for thirteen of these twenty one years. Colleen will be retiring from the company in January. Colleen has been our primary contact with all of you as well as the other members of the investment community. She leaves a legacy of what I believe is one of the best investor relations programs in our industry. So please join me in wishing Colleen a long happy and healthy retirement. Operator we\u2019re ready for the question and answer portion of our conference call. ","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. ","Greg Gordon ","I wanted to say congratulations as well to Colleen, you will be missed. ","Colleen Henderson","Thank you.","Greg Gordon ","Gosh, I think you have been doing this since I was in diapers in this business and I \u2013 so congratulations on that. ","Greg Gordon ","I do have a question on the fourth-quarter earnings and then a question on CapEx. So first, you guys earned -- I think you earned $0.63 in the fourth quarter last year, so if I just do that basic math, if you had a flat year you would be slightly above the high end of the range. Is the reason that you don't expect that to happen because you will be in a refund position on the sharing, or because you have found opportunities to do accelerated expense programs where they benefit customers? Or some combination of both or is there another item that I am not thinking about?","Allen Leverett","So let me start, Greg, on the fourth quarter earnings question and then I'll let Scott expand on a couple of points. So you touched on one of the issues which is the sharing mechanism at Wisconsin electric -- let's say sharing mechanism, the earning sharing mechanism at Wisconsin electric and Wisconsin gas and just keep in mind that's about 60% of our regulated utilities, so 60% of our earnings would be subject to that earning sharing mechanism. So we certainly expect that mechanism to kick in and there would be some sharing. In fact, we already accrued some sharing in the third. So that's the first factor that will impact, we expect it will impact the fourth quarter, you touched on that. ","The other thing, Greg, that I would just emphasize and Scott talked about this a little bit in his remarks but remember the electric fuel recovering mechanisms that we have at Wisconsin electric and Wisconsin public service, they have a dead-band, so in dollar terms it's a plus or minus $15 million at Wisconsin electric. It's a plus or minus $6 million at Wisconsin public service. And so once you get above those positive recovery levels, all of the dollars go, dollar for dollar above that level back to refunds for customers. Unlike the third quarter of last year we actually went all the way to the top of those bands in the third quarter of this year. In the fourth quarter of last year we had to get well into the fourth quarter before we hit those -- before we hit those levels. So that also introduced another timing difference or earnings timing difference if you will in third quarter as opposed to fourth. ","And the last thing is related to O&M spend. And what really happened, Greg, seems like every quarter we talk a lot about the weather but in the fourth quarter of 2015 that was a very mild weather quarter and as a result in order to hit the financial commitments we had, we actually had to cut back a bit on O&M spending. So I view the O&M spend run rate that we had in the fourth quarter of 2015 is being a little abnormal, meaning abnormally low. What I think we'll see in the fourth quarter this year is more of a normal run rate for the business the way it's configured now. So I think those three factors, the earning sharing mechanisms, hitting the top of the positive recovery bands on the fuel in the third quarter and finally that difference in O&M timing, I think all of those will impact the fourth quarter. I don't know Scott if you want to spend any time at all on the sharing mechanisms.","Scott Lauber","Yes, we can just cover that just a little bit, so at Wisconsin electric and Wisconsin gas at the sharing mechanism and remember there is an authorizer allowed return in Wisconsin electric of about 10.2% ROE and then we share the first 50 basis points above that. So we can directly earn up to the 10.45 and then anything above that or the sharing part of that will be used to basically amortize some of the transmission assets that we have on our balance sheet, that was part of the acquisition order. So that part of the sharing mechanism that will happen as we look at the fourth quarter again and tie it all together. ","As we look at the earnings in the fourth quarter last year, you factor in the interest expense that fell [$0.62] on a comparable basis and the fuel that Allen talked about, that\u2019s about $0.03, so you get down to that $0.59 and the O&M getting back to a normal run rate, and maintenance is about $0.02 to $0.03. so it gets into that $0.57, $0.59 range.","Allen Leverett","But Greg, I think you had a question on capital. ","Greg Gordon ","Yes, so you did mention it in your comments at the opening of the call. Can you talk a little bit more about specifically what kind of projects you have identified? I think at this point you have pretty much fully offset the $1 billion impact of bonus depreciation from the tax package that was passed last December. And I think you have even, if I count increases in the 2019 and 2020 CapEx forecast, have now basically gotten back into the sort of positive territory on total rate base additions relative to the impact of bonus. So can you talk about where you are in your thought process on updating your CapEx? You said there was still, a) what are the things that you have put into the plan that you think are beneficial for customers? And, b), what is still being -- you talk about I think at least one type of capital program that is still under consideration that hasn't been rolled out yet?","Allen Leverett","Well, in terms of the way the numbers break down, so overall if we look at our five year capital plan, it\u2019s about $1.6 billion more than the plan that was laid out in November of 2015 at EEI. So you're exactly right, Greg, it would offset the billion -- roughly $1 billion tax impact to bonus depreciation, plus another say $550 million on top of that. So just to give you a sense for the types of things, Greg, that are in $1.6 billion. So we alluded to one of them in the call. So there is $255 million for the generation in Michigan. I certainly see that as a benefit to the customers in the UP and also a benefit to customers in Wisconsin because once we retire Presque Isle there will be about a $40 million O&M savings associated with retirement plan. ","Also in the generation category we've made the assumption. We also expect that as soon as we can or we're allowed to by MISO we want to proceed to retire the Pulliam plant which is a coal plant at the Green Bay Area and that will leave a generation need in Wisconsin public service and we will have an option to invest. We have a generation option at the Riverside power plant that Alliant is building, that's about $100 million, so exercise on that first option. ","On the electric distribution side, I think we've talked before about the system modernization reliability program in the Wisconsin public service territory. So we're going to finish the first phase and do a second phase that will be about $100 million. That's a very popular program, we've seen a quite significant reliability benefit for the distribution customers in Wisconsin public service. ","On the gas distribution side, just to give you one example. I'm sure you and the other listeners on the call are very familiar with what's going on with FEMSA and the new rules that are coming on gas storage. We believe we\u2019re going to require about a $50 million program at the Manlove storage field in Illinois to do well workovers and put in the subsurface safety valves. So that's another $50 million. And then just to give you a couple of other examples. A number of software projects that we believe are going result in O&M savings. So short cycle work management system in Illinois. We're also going to move the automated meters at our Michigan gas utility as well as our Minnesota gas utility. So as you can tell from that litany, I mean there is quite a number of things that are in that list. And I believe, our team believes that they'll all be beneficial to customers either from a cost standpoint or reliability or both. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Steve Fleishman ","Just briefly, the higher capital plan for Illinois, will that be just recovered the same way it\u2019s been done under the legislation for the gas system?","Allen Leverett","Well at this point, Steve, I would expect that the roughly $50 million for the storage field that we would do that under traditional regulation as opposed to using a rider mechanism.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. ","Jonathan Arnold ","Colleen, our best wishes as well. Thank you for all your help over the years.","Colleen Henderson","Thank you very much, Jonathan. Say thanks to Caroline too.","Jonathan Arnold ","She joins me in those wishes. So just quickly on -- you gave a number I think of $0.08 of weather in the quarter in the prepared remarks. I was just curious whether that was net of any of the accrued sharing that you had in the quarter or just could we break that down a little further?","Scott Lauber","Sure, the $0.08 in Wisconsin electric is really just looking at the margins itself and the fuel recovery, so there's about $0.03 positive fuel recoveries in the third quarter, that wasn\u2019t really expected usually like Allen said was in the fourth quarter. In addition, the other $0.05 was the weather margin related in Wisconsin electric\u2019s territory. The warm weather in Wisconsin was -- across the state but mainly that southeatern Wisconsin was about 50% warmer than normal, so quite an extreme warm weather over the quarter. ","Jonathan Arnold ","Thank you for that. And then I guess I think Greg got most of my other things, but just may I ask what should we anticipate incrementally at least in broad terms from you guys at EEI in a week or so?","Allen Leverett","Well I think in terms of the broad numbers you have them. So in terms of the capital forecast we've laid that out today. I think Scott and Beth and Colleen will be prepared to lay out -- give you further detail behind those numbers. But in terms of the broad numbers you have them, Jonathan. ","Jonathan Arnold ","So just more fleshing out the details on the CapEx, etc.?","Allen Leverett","That's exactly right, Jonathan. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. ","Michael Weinstein ","Congratulations, Colleen, you will definitely be missed and I am sure that \u2013","Colleen Henderson","Thank you very much.","Michael Weinstein ","Looking forward to working with Beth again closer and everything so it will be great. In terms of the CapEx plan, are you -- what can you say about the longer-term 5% to 7% growth rate post 2016 and the impact of it on that?","Allen Leverett","And I think if you take -- and I think it's important to mention this on the call that if you take the capital that I talked about for the retail utilities, plus the capital plan for ATC, we view that as being supportive of the 5% to 7% range level.","Michael Weinstein ","Okay, so within and supportive.","Allen Leverett","Correct. ","Michael Weinstein ","Are you going to be updating the 10-year capital projection plan at EEI or --?","Scott Lauber","Yeah we're pulling that together right now working with the operations and the president just to lay out the remaining five years of that plan. So we will have something at EEI.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides ","Congrats on a great quarter and year to date. One question, if I look at the year to date numbers in the earnings packet, one of the things that doesn't really stand out a lot is the impact of O&M, right. So when you give kind of the small verbal not verbal -- the small written descriptions on page 11 of what the contribution at each segment to potentially lower O&M. It\u2019s actually not that big of a number and that strikes me just at first glance a little bit surprising given you are not even a year and a half post merger. I'm just curious, is that being embedded somewhere else or are you not seeing much in the way of O&M reductions post Integrys? I'm trying to just think this through a little bit.","Scott Lauber","Yeah, I mean there is some O&M sprinkled throughout so we are seeing O&M and all the other segments, Wisconsin, Illinois, the other states, and remember Allen talked about some of the sharing mechanisms and that we've booked a little bit in the quarter about $18 million, that is actually an acceleration of transmission cost, so that is buried in that O&M number. ","Michael Lapides ","And is that a - that $18 million, is that all you have taken for the year so far or was there any taken in the first half?","Scott Lauber","No, that's all that\u2019s taken for the year and of course, that all depends upon the fourth quarter. ","Michael Lapides ","One other thing. If I think about what is kind of going on in the various businesses, and I know you updated capital spending, but your CapEx outlook at ATC kind of has a little bit of a mini cliff, meaning CapEx is elevated and then and in another year, year and a half from now it kind of declines significantly down to the $400 million level or so at the ATC consolidated level. Do you still see that happening? Do you see anything in the horizon that could drive much of an uptick at ATC that could kind of fill that? Or do you just simply expect ATC growth to slow down a bit?","Allen Leverett","Let me let me maybe talk about that Michael in two pieces. So inside the footprint, when I say inside the footprint, that would be inside Wisconsin and the UP, Michigan. I mean you're right you're going to see or we expect to see somewhat of a deceleration or lowering in the spending at ATC. However if you look at the ten year numbers, the last cycle when they updated their ten year outlook, it was 3.7 to 4.5. This cycle is 3.6 to 4.4. So if you look over a ten year period, the ten year numbers aren't that different. But in terms of the annual averages those are -- I would expect they're going to come down somewhat, Michel, because they're very very large, very very significant reliability projects inside the footprint, a lot of those are done. ","Now as perhaps the generation patterns change in the state because of clean power plan, perhaps you could see an uptick again but right now we expect it to come down somewhat. So that\u2019s the inside the footprint. Outside the footprint, we're certainly pursuing other investments and we talked about on previous calls, we talked about that a little bit. So that's one of the reasons why a number of years ago because of what we saw coming with inside the plant, why we want to start pursuing something outside of Wisconsin and Michigan. ","Michael Lapides ","One last question, how are you thinking -- and I know you said in your prepared remarks that you will give a little bit of an update on this on the fourth-quarter call. But just curious about your thoughts on whether you would file cases in Wisconsin. And I guess a little bit of my question is more of a legal or regulatory one. Do you have to file a case in Wisconsin next year or if you don't feel the need you can stay out for another year or so?","Allen Leverett","Well I think from a practical standpoint and let\u2019s just put the legalities aside, I think from a practical standpoint Michael, anything we do whether we would decide to file or not to file, we would want to reach agreement with the commission staff about that. So just putting legalities aside, I think whatever we do whichever one of those paths we go down, we would want to do that with the agreement of the staff. And then just to reiterate what I was saying earlier in the call we would start having those conversations early in the new year with the staff.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. ","Paul Ridzon ","I don't know if you went over this, but what was the refund in the third quarter? And what do you expect in the fourth quarter assuming normal weather?","Allen Leverett","Well there were no refunds. What we did, Paul, just to be clear is we accrued under the sharing mechanism, we accrued $18 million pretax in the third quarter and then based upon the fourth quarter results you get to a final number, that 18 could increase, it could decrease, because the accounting period you look at for sharing with the calendar year. ","Scott Lauber","Yeah there's really not a refund. It's really just paying down of regulatory asset or reducing a future rate increase. So that was going to get cash back to customers, we will be able to reduce or not increase rates in the future related to it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson ","Thanks so much for your help over the years. Let me just circle back on the gas CapEx numbers. Was it right to understand that about $50 million is the amount that won't be going through the -- it will be more of a traditional sort of rate case approach, is that right?","Allen Leverett","No, and let me just sort of clarify to make sure everybody understands. So I expect next year if you look at the system modernization program, this would be basically the replacement of the cast iron mains to meters what not, but that will be nearly $300 million of spending in 2017. And that will go going back to Steve Fleishman\u2019s question, that $300 million will go through the QIP rider. In addition to that I expect that we're going to have to spend $50 million on the safety related things at the Manlove field. That $50 million, Paul, I think it spreads out over three or four years but they're spread out a few years but at this point I would not expect to put that $50 million to the QIP rider. ","Paul Patterson ","And then the other amount is -- I mean let me ask you this. So the increase that we see over what you guys had in September was like $130 million is about -- the $50 million, annually speaking that is, I don't know, that\u2019s over several years, so that\u2019s only part of it. And the other amount, is it the AMRP that\u2019s -- what is the incremental difference I guess from what you guys \u2013 ","Scott Lauber","The other part is a variety of different items and like Allen said those items I mean it ranges from additional infrastructure work to the meters that are outside of the footprint, also some software in there. So that those there do not go through the rider. However we you have depreciation in an ongoing basis and that's really filling in some of that normal depreciation in the area. ","Paul Patterson ","Okay. And then there was I guess a filing regarding methane mapping that I think covers [ph] is suggesting would substantially increase the efficiency of this AMR -- this accelerated main replacement program. So do you have any comments on that or I mean is that any -- do you guys -- what do you guys think about that?","Allen Leverett","Well just to be clear this is related to methane leaks on the gas distribution system in Chicago. And my understanding of the approach that the team uses there is prioritized projects, it already takes into account leak rates -- methane leak rates. So there's already the attempt built into that process, that variable if you will and trying to reduce methane leaks. So I would view that we're already trying to address that in a way we do the prioritization. Certainly if there's a better more precise way to factor that into the process, that's certainly something we can consider that it's already being considered in the current prioritization process. ","Paul Patterson ","Okay, great. And then there was this -- in Michigan there is discussion of increasing transmission with Ontario. And they see that as a potential to lower rates and what have you. And I was just wondering is there any opportunity there or any impact associated with -- do you guys have any thoughts about that? I think it is the Upper Peninsula that they are talking about. Any thoughts about that or any color on that?","Allen Leverett","Yeah, not a lot of color but I could give you, Paul, and my understanding that this would be a study that the state government there would kick off and look at the feasibility of that and what would it cost et cetera but not any real color that I can get around that. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital. ","Andy Levi ","Colleen, 20 years I think, right? 25, how long have you been IR?","Colleen Henderson","21.","Andy Levi ","21, okay 21 years. 21 years, okay. I've been doing this longer than you, pretty scary. But thank you for everything, Colleen. You've always been very good to me. So I will never -- it is not forgotten, I appreciate it. And then most of my questions were answered. I just have two questions. Just Allen in general, obviously you added a lot of CapEx, you filled everything in, it\u2019s like $1.9 billion a year. Any reason to think as you get more comfortable in 2017 that the growth rate could go higher?","Allen Leverett","Well I think as I look at the capital spending and in response to one of the previous questions, we certainly view that what we put on the table for retail CapEx in the retail utilities, what ATC has put on the table for the inside the footprint we all view that as being supportive of the earnings per share guidance range. The way I would answer your question, Andy, actually to kick ourselves in that range, we're going to need to be able to be successful with some of these transmission developments outside of the traditional footprint at ATC. So I think if I certainly saw a significant way, some successes outside the footprint at ATC, that would certainly give me some comfort to put your forecast above but still within that 5% to 7% range.","Andy Levi ","Because the $1.9 billion or plus year seems much higher than what it was when you originally came out with the growth rate. And then so by the time you got to like \u201819 or \u201820 it adds a couple cents, a couple cents, a couple cents every year.","Allen Leverett","Go ahead.","Andy Levi ","No, no, no, so I was just kind of doing some dumb math which I am really good at. And -- emphasizing the dumb part -- Go ahead.","Allen Leverett","I think you should keep in mind, Andy, one of the areas -- remember we had this additional bonus depreciation was kind of in in the middle here, so that was a $1 billion cash tax impact. The other thing that perhaps people don't talk about quite as much, since we talked about a 5% to 7% earnings per share growth range we've seen allowed rates of return, most notably the allowed rate of returns FERC go down. So there's sort of then some puts and takes. Certainly there have been some increases in our projected level of capital spending, those are the puts and takes. We certainly had bonus appreciation and some reduction in allowed rate of return.","Andy Levi ","That explains that. And then the last question I had is around Point Beach. And how does the contract [indiscernible] NextEra? Does the contract start to -- does it start to increase I guess in price next year? Is that how it works?","Allen Leverett","Yeah, and then so maybe sort of go back because a lot of people may not have the history with the Point Beach with the PPA and the sale of the asset, just and I'm sure you remember, Andy, but for the benefit of others, on the call, so back in -- actually December of 2006 we announced the sale of the plant and some associated PPAs with NextEra. We went through a very protracted contested case proceeding in Wisconsin leading up to the actual financial closing of the sale in 2007. ","Now during that protracted prolonged contested case proceeding the commission approved not only the sale of the nuclear plant, the two units, so the both of the units but they also reviewed and approved the PPAs and there were refunds of the above book and the proceeds that we got above book for the plant as well as the excess nuclear decommissioning funds that were in the trust. So the PPA as well as the sale, all were reviewed in that proceeding. And then ever since then these PPP payments have been consistently recovered in the fuel costs. So I think all that background, all that context is important, and I think Scott, maybe you could fill in \u2013 I mean I don\u2019t have if we have the specific numbers in terms of at least the next two years what happens with -- I don't have them handy. ","Scott Lauber","Yeah. So they increase slightly in \u201917 and \u201918 about 1% and that's a like \u201919 or \u201920 that we start going up at 6% rate. ","Andy Levi ","So beginning in 2019 rates start to increase 6% to 7% a year, but it is not until \u201819. So there is no issue in \u201817 or \u201818 as far as what you file and having to worry about I guess not rate fatigue but rates going up too fast. So in \u201819 when you have the 6% to 7% increase, and that goes over like a 10-year period, right, where the rates increase every year 6% or 7% beginning in \u201819, is that right?","Allen Leverett","Yes.","Andy Levi ","So with that being the case, on a -- I guess just for the Wisconsin -- the legacy customer, right? Obviously not for the Integrys customer. But for that portion that goes up beginning in \u201819 what is that as far as an overall rate increase? Because it's obviously just a portion of your total generation. Would you be able to figure that out? Is that a number that you know?","Allen Leverett","Well as we get to 2019, so the figures that Scott talked about, if you do it in a total rate, if you look at it in total rates, my recollection is, it\u2019s about 1.25% somewhere in that range, 1.25% uplift on total rates.","Andy Levi ","That should actually -- because that's actually I guess probably the only question I should have asked because that was more than I wanted to know. Okay. Well, thank you very much and I will see you guys in a week. Colleen, bon voyage, enjoy.","Operator","Our final question will come from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides ","Hey guys. Real quick, Scott, the increase in CapEx, should we assume there is a pro forma increase therefore in the benefit you will get an bonus D&A? Kind of just thinking about it pro rata that whatever bonus D&A assumptions are they go up by a little bit of the percent change in CapEx that you are increasing by?","Scott Lauber","Correct. So the bonus appreciation is through 2019 and the new additional CapEx would qualify for the bonus.","Michael Lapides ","So what were you all saying bonus D&A was and what do you think it will be now? I am just trying to think about the cash flow impact for you.","Scott Lauber","Yeah. So when you look at $1 billion was with the original plan. I'm sure it's a couple hundred million more, will probably be a cash tax payer in like 2018.","End of Q&A","Allen Leverett","Okay. Well thank you very much for your questions.

During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale E. Klappa","Colleen, thank you. On this beautiful spring day, good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining us as we review the company's 2013 first quarter results. I'll begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of WE Generation; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dixon, Controller; and Scott Lauber, Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.76 a share for the first quarter of 2013. This compares with earnings of $0.74 a share for the first quarter last year. The results were stronger than last year, primarily because of favorable weather, the positive impact of our share repurchases and slightly higher earnings at WE Power. You may recall that we experienced the warmest winter in 122 years last year. By contrast, this winter was colder than normal. And March was a particularly strong month. We actually delivered 71% more natural gas to our customers in March of this year than March a year ago. Our earnings also rose by $0.01 a share at WE Power in light of the final approval during our last Wisconsin rate case of the investment in our new Oak Creek units. In addition, the impact of our share repurchase program added $0.01 a share to our earnings for the quarter. We also continued to achieve milestones in the operational areas. In fact, J.D. Power & Associates has ranked our company the #1 large utility in the midwest for customer satisfaction among business customers.","Turning now to the economy in our region. Wisconsin's unemployment rate climbed to 7.1% in March. That's up from 6.7% in December, but still well below the national average. Given that the economy was just treading water during the winter months, it's not surprising that Energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers declined by about 3.9% compared to the first quarter a year ago. The main drivers of this reduction were lower Energy sales to our largest customer, the iron ore mines in Michigan's upper Peninsula and the impact of leap year in 2012, obviously not recurring in 2013. Factoring out the impact of the mines, leap year and weather, sales to our large commercial and industrial customers declined just slightly by 0.5%. Overall, sales to our large customers were in line with our expectations for the first quarter. We did however, see growth in several sectors particularly printing and publishing and the production of plastics. An uptick in new customer connections also continued in the first quarter. New electric service installations were up 5% compared to the first quarter of 2012 and connections of new natural gas customers rose by 3.9%, again, compared to the same period last year.","Now, as many of you know, we have 1 major construction project underway. Our biomass fueled power plant and Rothchild, Wisconsin. Construction is now nearly 80% complete and we're on schedule for commercial operation by the end of 2013. Erection of the main boiler was finished earlier this year. The switch yard has now been energized and connected to the distribution system. And piping and electrical installation continue throughout the project. We successfully completed a hydro test of the boiler in February, ensuring that all boiler pipes are welded properly and can function under the required operating pressures. We began conducting steam blows earlier this month, pushing steam through the pipes to clear dirt and debris that accumulate during construction. Work on the fuel handling system, which includes the truck dumper and the conveyor network, continues, and we expect the fuel handling system to be completed, powered and ready for testing during the second quarter of this year. And then just 2 days from now, we'll be hosting our annual stockholders meeting in Rothchild. We're offering our shareholders an opportunity to tour the construction site and see the progress firsthand.","Now, as I've noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. We'll be able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will produce electricity for the grid and steam for the operating paper mill will clearly enhance the economics of the project. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total some $255 million and that's excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Turning now to Wisconsin Regulatory matters. As you may recall, the rate request we filed in 2012 with the Wisconsin Commission for electric, natural gas and steam rates covered our revenue requirements for the years 2013 and 2014. The commission completed its review, and issued a final order last December for rates that went into effect on January 1. Our request, of course, was driven primarily by the investment of approximately $1.6 billion in previously approved capital projects, including the air-quality controls at our older Oak Creek units, the Glacier Hills Wind Park and the Rothchild biomass plant. Switching gears now, you'll recall that in 2011, our board authorized this buyback up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock. That authorization runs through the end of 2013. During the first quarter, we purchased approximately 279,000 shares at a cost of $11.1 million. Since the program began, we repurchased approximately $4,930,000 shares at a cost of just under $163 million. That equates to an average purchase price of $33.03 a share. And as we previously announced, our board has adopted a dividend policy that targets a 60% payout ratio in 2014 trending to a 65% to 70% ratio in 2017. This policy should support double-digit dividend growth next year and 7% to 8% increases from 2015 to 2017 as we move toward a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. Of course, in January the board raised the quarterly dividend to $0.34 a share, an increase of 13.3%. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.36 a share.","Now, I'd like to turn to another topic and discuss the investment opportunities that we see in our core business as we focus on delivering the future. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2013 through 2017. And with this 5-year budget, the nature of our capital investments are shifting away from high-profile projects such as our Power The Future units, renewable generation and larger quality controls. Instead, our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. Over the next 5 years, we will focus on the building blocks, if you will, of our delivery business: Pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations. Starting this year and continuing through 2017, we plan to rebuild 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines that are, today, more than 50 years old. We also intend to replace 18,500 power poles, 20,000 transformers and literally hundreds of substation components. On the natural gas side of our business, we plan to replace 1,250 miles of gas mains, as well as 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and approximately 233,000-meter sets. The primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory and construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the megaprojects that we've completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest. We'll of course keep you up-to-date as these needed infrastructure upgrades move forward.","And along those lines, we have identified the need for additional capacity on our natural gas distribution system in the western part of Wisconsin to address reliability and to meet growing demand. This demand is driven in part by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in that region. We've evaluated routes and submitted our application to the Wisconsin Commission on March 28. We're asking for authority to build a natural gas lateral that would stretch for approximately 85 miles from Eau Claire County in the far western part of the state to the city of Tomah in Monroe County, in West Central Wisconsin. If approved, construction could start in early 2015 with a projected in-service date during the fourth quarter of 2015. Our projected investment in the initial phase of this project is expected to range between $150 million and $170 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Moving now from distribution to generation, as you recall, we signed a definitive agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative in late November of last year that calls for Wolverine to acquire a minority interest in the Presque Power Plant in Marquette Michigan by funding new state-of-the-art emission controls for the facility. The new controls are necessary to meet expected changes in air-quality rules while maintaining system reliability in Michigan's upper Peninsula. We began seeking regulatory approval of the joint venture in February of this year. We've already received orders from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Michigan Public Service Commission and proceedings in Wisconsin are moving along well. We're targeting receipt of all necessary approvals by early fourth quarter of this year and we hope to begin construction in 2014. As a reminder, the joint venture will not reduce our rate base, but we expect that it will reduce our operating costs.","And you'll remember that we also announced plans to convert the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. As a reminder, the Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located on the Menomonee River here in Milwaukee that generates electricity for the grid, provides voltage support for the grid, and produces reliable steam to heat more than 450 downtown Milwaukee buildings. Our analysis shows that converting the fuel source for the plant will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. The electric capacity of the plant is expected to remain at 280 megawatts. We filed an application with the Wisconsin Commission just last week on April 26. If approved, our target for completing the conversion at Valley will be late 2015 or early 2016. The current cost estimate? $65 million to $70 million. Now, this project will follow the $26 million upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. We believe the plan we put in place will secure Valley's role in meeting the energy needs of a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.","Turning now to our Oak Creek expansion units, we continue to make progress on our fuel flexibility initiative at the plant. We received a revised air permit from the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources that will allow us to make changes at the Oak Creek expansion units. Changes that are necessary for the blending of Eastern bituminous and Western sub-bituminous coal. The units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, but given the current cost differential between bituminous and sub-bituminous coal, our customers could see annual fuel savings of $25 million to $50 million depending on the amount of sub-bituminous coal that could be used in blending. We expect to begin testing now in May and to continue our testing into 2014. We would then apply for authority from the Wisconsin Commission to invest in the plant upgrades that would be needed.","Another possible investment opportunity that we continue to follow is the potential sale of the electric and steam generating plants that are owned by the state of Wisconsin. The governor has proposed a new 2-year state budget that includes a provision to expand the state's authority to sell or lease certain state-owned properties including these plants. We expect the Wisconsin Legislature to complete its action on the state budget by mid-summer.","Finally, I'd like to give you an update in our plan to build a new powerhouse at the Twin Falls hydroelectric site. Twin Falls is located on the border of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Twin Falls is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. It was built back in 1912. And while the plant is licensed to operate until 2040, the existing powerhouse is badly in need of repair. We considered several alternatives, but the most prudent course is to build a new powerhouse. The project also calls for adding spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. We filed an application with the Wisconsin Commission for a certificate of authority for the project, as well as a license amendment application with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We have also been securing other necessary permits and licenses along the way. Assuming the project is approved, we expect to begin construction in the fall of 2013 with completion in 2016. We estimate the cost of the project to be between $60 million and $65 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Now, before wrapping our update up, I have a quick update for you on American Transmission Company. We're the second largest owner of ATC with an ownership stake of 26.2%. Of course, ATC is investing in its traditional service area, but the company is also reviewing transmission investments in other parts of the country. ATC is pursuing these investments through a joint venture with Duke Energy known as DATC. As many of you may already know, DATC recently acquired a 72% interest in California's Path 15 transmission line for an investment of $56 million. Path 15 is an 84-mile, 500 kv line in Central California. The Wisconsin Energy equity investment in this project is expected to be approximately $7.4 million.","In conclusion, our company continues to perform at a high level and we're off to a strong start in 2013. And now, for the details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2013 first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.76 a share compared with $0.74 a share for the same quarter in 2012. The results were better than last year primarily because of favorable weather, the positive impact of our share repurchases and increased earnings at WE Power. Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $321 million as compared to $295.7 million in 2012, an increase of $25.3 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, you will see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $230.6 million for 2013, an increase of $22 million over the first quarter of 2012. As Gale mentioned earlier, we experienced a colder than normal winter, which was a significant contrast from 2012 when we experienced record warmth. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we estimate that our electric and gas margins improved by $50.4 million because of the weather. This year, we estimate that we were helped by $16.2 million as compared to normal weather. And last year, we estimate that we were hurt by $34.2 million because of the abnormally warm weather.","As we turn to the other factors impacting utility operating income, recall that we implemented new rates for our electric and gas customers in Wisconsin effective January 1 of this year. These new rates reflect our investments in environmental controls and renewable energy. These rates also reflect changes in our O&M costs, including the reinstatement of the amortization of certain regulatory assets. If you recall, last year, as part of our base rate freeze, we had a regulatory amortization holiday. With that as background, you will notice that our depreciation expense is up $7.9 million, primarily because of the investment in environmental controls. We also estimate that the impact of leap year in 2012, not repeating of course in 2013, reduced our electric and gas margins by $6.7 million. Our fuel recoveries are $5.1 million behind last year's first quarter and our O&M costs are $4.2 million higher this year. As I mentioned, last year we had an amortization holiday that reduced our annual O&M by $148 million or $37.5 million per quarter. This year, we reinstated the amortization. However, our bad debt expense was down by $17.2 million this quarter and we lengthened the lives of certain other amortizations, which reduced expenses by approximately $3 million. In addition, the business units reduced operating costs by approximately $13.1 million as compared to last year. Combining all of these items brings you to the $4.2 million increase in O&M costs. Our O&M cost will vary each quarter. However, as a reminder, we expect our annual O&M cost to be flat to 2% higher than 2012. Finally, we had an additional $4.5 million of other net costs, which when combined with the above items, resulted in a $22 million net increase in utility operating income.","I would also like to mention 1 item briefly that is affecting our quarterly earnings. As you may recall, we expect to receive a federal tax grant when we complete our new biomass facility later this year. Our customers are currently receiving the benefits of this grant through bill credits. However, accounting rules do not allow us to recognize a grant income until the plant is placed into service. We estimate that our first quarter earnings would have been $0.03 [ph]  higher if we have recorded the grant income to match the bill credits.","Now, turning to our non-utility segment, operating income in this segment was up $3.2 million this quarter because of the final approval of our Power The Future plant costs in the last Wisconsin rate case. We expect this increase to continue each quarter throughout 2013. Taking the changes for these 2 segments together, and a slight improvement a corporate and other, you arrive at the $25.3 million increase in operating income. Earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $16.6 million in the first quarter, which is a $1 million improvement over the same period in 2012. Our other income net, declined by $11.6 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased as a result of the completion of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units last year. In addition, our net interest expense increased by $6.1 million, primarily because of the completion of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units. Once the construction was completed, we stopped capitalizing interests.","Consolidated income tax expense rose by $4.1 million because of higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2013 is expected to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $176.6 million of net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2013, or earnings of $0.76 per share.","During the first quarter of 2013, we generated $330.3 million of cash from operations, a $10.2 million decrease from the first quarter of 2012. This decrease is a result of higher working capital requirements driven by higher accounts receivable and accrued revenue, given the colder weather, compared to last year. Partially offsetting this is higher net income and higher depreciation and amortization. Our total capital expenditures decreased by $8.7 million in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the opening quarter of 2012. We saw lower expenditures because construction is complete on the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units. This was partially offset by additional capital expenditures related to the biomass project. We also paid $77.8 million in common dividends in 2013, an increase of $8.7 million over 2012. Dividends for the year equate to an annual rate of $1.36 per share which is a 13.3% increase over the prior year's annual dividend of $1.20 per share. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52.3% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. The projected year end debt-to-total capital is expected to be relatively flat with 2012 year end. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. And as shown in the earnings package on our website, retail sales of electricity increased by 0.5% in the first quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2012. Our normalized first quarter sales were down by 0.6%. All normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of leap year and weather. Leap year alone caused the decline of approximately 1.1% in 2013 relative to 2012.","Looking at the individual customer segments, with the return of colder weather, we saw actual residential sales up 5.2% and on a normalized basis, the sales were up 0.4%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, we actually saw -- we saw actual quarterly sales up 1.3%. On a normalized basis, sales of small, commercial and industrial customers were down 0.7%.  In the large commercial & industrial segment, on a normalized basis, sales for the first quarter of 2013 were down by 1.4%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines, sales were down 0.5%. Overall, these results are in line with our expectations.","Turning now to our earnings forecast. First, we're reaffirming our 2013 guidance of $2.38 a share to $2.48 a share. While we were helped by the first quarter weather, we still have 9 more months of weather variability ahead of us.","Before I turn things back to Gale, I would also like to provide guidance on our second quarter earnings. As background, we earned $0.51 per share in the second quarter of 2012. However, the weather boosted our second quarter earnings last year by $0.03 per share. In addition, our 2012 earnings were frontloaded because of the allowance for funds used during construction that we booked on the air quality control project at older Oak Creek units. Also, as mentioned earlier, we cannot record the income from the federal tax grant for our biomass plant until the plant is placed into service. The customer bill credits will continue in the second quarter and this is expected to reduce our quarterly earnings by $0.03 per share. Taking these factors into consideration, and assuming normal weather, we estimate our 2013 second quarter earnings to be in the range of $0.42 to $0.46 per share. And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa","Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Question-and-Answer Session","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Real quick question. And by the way, congrats guys on a good quarter. Just curious in terms of how you're thinking -- and this may be an Allen question, how you're thinking about the capital expansion process? I know it's kind of in the budget for ATC, but in terms of the execution part of that, meaning getting permits, getting siting, getting it done on time, on trajectory?","Gale E. Klappa","That's definitely an Allen question.","Allen L. Leverett","I guess you'd have to take that in sort of in 2 parts, Michael. Within the state of Wisconsin, within [indiscernible] and within the upper Peninsula of Michigan, they certainly had a very, now long-standing, over a decade, process that's pretty well understood and they have a good process at ATC to go through that. And really, the only uncertainty there is when you bring a project forward, the primary uncertainty is the time frame that are going to be required to get regulatory approvals. But typically, for a CA, the way a CA works now, once your CA is deemed complete, it's no more than 360 days to get approval. There's a 180-day initial period and then the Commission can extend that for another 180 days. So I think within the footprints, that would be the primary question, just the length of time that it would take to get a regulatory approval. Outside the footprints, I mean we're still pretty early days, Michael, on doing projects outside the footprint. Gale mentioned the Path 15 investment, but that was an existing transmission line. So outside of the footprint, not a lot that I can say about that. But candidly, if you look at our forecast for this year, '14, '15, we're not assuming any projects outside the footprint in any case. Hopefully, that helps.","Gale E. Klappa","And Michael, I think Allen made an important point. If you look at the capital expenditures that we've broken down in our Investor Day that we talked about, the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period, Allen is correct. We do not include any outside the footprint investment in ATC in those numbers. So that would be investment upside.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And how about on the gas side? I mean, lots of what I'm asking about is very nuts and bolts stuff. But you've got a lot of gas distribution infrastructure investment in your plan over the next couple of years. Just curious whether siting -- how does siting and permitting process of that works in the state of Wisconsin? Do you have to go to local siding boards? Do you go straight to PSC and it serves as kind of centralized siding board, et cetera?","Gale E. Klappa","Both are good questions, Michael. The answer is really in 2 parts. For much of the gas distribution work that we've described, there really is not -- the individual projects did not rise to the level where we need to seek construction authority from the Wisconsin Commission. For example, we mentioned 83,000 individual gas lines. Those would be the lines that come off the street and hook directly to your home. Those projects are much smaller in nature and do not require a construction authority permitting from the Wisconsin commission. Certainly, the largest project that we have in front of us on the gas the distribution side that will require construction authority from the Wisconsin Commission is the one that we've mentioned and that's the Western Wisconsin Gas expansion. That is a very significant project, $150 million to $170 million in the initial phase. And so we've begun the process there of seeking approval. We filed our initial request in late March. Then we will have a -- Allen, a supplemental construction authority request in late summer.","Allen L. Leverett","Yes, there's some additional environmental information that we have to file in August.","Operator","Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My question goes to what happened in the quarter vis-a-vis sales and what you're hearing from your customers for the balance of the year. Because clearly, you had a pullback in sales from industrial, but it was driven by natural resources. Obviously, we've had a big deflation in commodity prices because of what's going over in China and that had a big impact on your 1 particular customer. But in the manufacturing segment and other segments of the industrial mosaic and your service territory, can you give us some more color on what you're seeing there?","Gale E. Klappa","I'd be happy to, Greg. And let me back up. As you know, when we put our sales forecasts together for a new coming year, we interview our 120 largest industrial customers and get their direct feedback on their expectation in terms of demand for the following calendar year. When we did those interviews late last fall, I don't think there's any question that we were hearing a good bit of conservatism and a good bit of caution from our large industrial customer base. And if you recall, those interviews were being done at a time when the whole issue about sequester, the whole issue about federal debt ceiling and everything we went through at the end of the year was very much on people's minds. And our customers are proving -- I mean to have given us really good input. I mean, they were expecting a soft first quarter in terms of what they were seeing for orders and demand. And that has turned out to be the case. When you basically take out leap year and weather normalize, our industrial sales were about dead on to where we thought they would be in Q1. Now, we're projecting a little bit of uptick, not much, in the remaining quarters. So in essence, what we're seeing is an economy treading water. The only 2 sectors that showed any material growth at all -- we serve 17 different industrial sectors of the economy. The only 2 sectors that showed any growth at all were, believe it or not, printing and publishing and production of plastics. Everything else pretty much just right where it was. Not a lot of big upside, not a lot of downside. Just treading water. We're a bit cautiously optimistic over the course of the remainder of the year, but no, we were not deviating from the sales forecast. There's no indication yet that things are really turning around.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Great. And then second and last question. In terms of the buyback. Obviously, the average price at which you have already bought back stock is pretty good relative to -- where the stock is trading now, what can you tell us about how you think about the potential for completing a buyback relative to other opportunities and deployed capital with your stock trading at such a big P\/E [ph]  and price to book multiple?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, it's a good question, Greg, and we continue to look everyday at whether or not we want to be in the market buying stock. Over the long-term, I can tell you, it would not be the intention of the management here to build up a big cash reserve. I don't think that's what we're being paid for from our stockholders. But obviously, we're going to be opportunistic as we have been in the past on share buyback.","Operator","Julien Dumoulin-Smith from UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","First question here, sort of on the structure of these asset sales, if you will. Could you guys talk to what is being currently contemplated in the state or on how they would -- what this would look like? Obviously, it doesn't seem to be more rate-based, but some sort of contract of sorts, and when this all would hash out? Obviously you mentioned end of summer now. What does that translate to in terms of actually putting down dollars and getting returns on those investments?","Gale E. Klappa","Okay. We'll handle kind of each question one at a time. In terms of the process itself, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, the governor has put a provision in the state budget that would authorize the State Department of Administration to conduct a process, if you will, to sell a number of state-owned properties including power plants and steam-generating plants that the state owns. The budget itself needs to be passed because a state is on a fiscal year ending June. The budget itself, in all likelihood, will be passed end of June sometime early July. Assuming the provision holds in the state budget, then the state Department of Administration would set up a process. We're not certain how the State Department of Administration would actually design the process. But we are quite certain this would not become part of our traditional rate base. This would not be subject to Public Service Commission review and approval as it's currently constituted, anyway. And so it would not become part of the rate base although Allen and I would expect, given the fact that the process would unfold assuming the law passed in the second half of this year, then we really would be looking at 2014.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Yes. I would assume that if the bill is passed of course and the DOA moves expeditiously to ask for proposals, you could easily see financial closing in the first half of 2014.","Gale E. Klappa","And then one other point. We would obviously, in any bid that we would make, we would obviously require a very transparent and firm power sales, or steam sales agreement. So these would not become -- while they would not be rate base per se, they would not become merchant units either.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Would it be fair to say that the return profile of this would be somewhat akin to a traditionally regulated asset? Is that a fair statement?","Gale E. Klappa","That would certainly be our current thinking, yes.","Operator","Andy Bischof with MorningStar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just comment on the levels switching from gas back to coal in your generation portfolio? A couple of your peers have kind of posted dramatic shifts in generation mix given the recent rebound, and was just curious to what you're seeing.","Gale E. Klappa","We'll be to. Allen actually has some specifics statistics for you and I think the frame that we're basically seeing -- remember that song by Maxine Nightingale, \"Gonna get right back where you started from?\" Those are Allen's statistics in a nutshell. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett","Well with that as a lead in, let me talk about that in 2 different ways. One way to sort of think about it in terms of energy mix. So in other words, what percentage of our electricity is produced by coal as opposed to natural gas. If you look pre-2012, so if you look at sort of the average of 2008, '09, '10, '11, 3 or 4 years before 2012, we were at about 59% of our electricity was produced with coal. Last year we're about 45%. So in 2012, we're at 45%. However, this year we see that bouncing back to 57%. So at this point at least, 2012 looks to be a bit of an anomaly because, as Gale pointed out, with his vocal analogy, the 57% is pretty close to the 59% that we saw before 2012. That was driven not only by lower natural gas prices or low natural gas prices in 2012, but we did take a very long outage at our South Oak Creek power plant when we did the tie-ins of the AQCS equipment, so we had both of those things going on. In terms of fuel burn, we burned about 8 million -- just over 8 million tons of coal last year. I expect we'll be close to 11 million tons this year. So we see coal bouncing back. Natural gas last year, we're at 45.5 BCF. My current forecast is about 33.  So, at this point at least, it doesn't look like a secular trend. But obviously if we saw low natural gas prices again, you could have somewhat of a replay of 2012.","Gale E. Klappa","And do have one other advantage, and that is, when you look at the efficiency and the heat rates of our new Power The Future units, I believe our new Port Washington natural gas fire combined cycle units have the best heat rate in the Midwest market in our new expansion units at Oak Creek and our older units at Oak Creek are in the top decile in the Midwest in terms of efficiency. So they will be dispatched depending upon the comparative costs of coal and natural gas. But we have very efficient units that are serving our customers well.","Operator","Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just to follow-up on that question. What natural gas price range would you kind of start to see some season meaningful switching back to gas?","Allen L. Leverett","Well if you -- in order to answer that question, you have to talk about what type of coal are you using? At Sub-bituminous coal, if your unit -- and remember our Pleasant Prairie Plant and our South Oak Creek, they are already 100% sub-bituminous coal. So to actually see them being out of the market as compared to natural gas, you'd have to see natural gas down and say maybe at the $2.75 to $2.50 range. So you'd have to see pretty low gas prices to actually see those units displaced. Now, the current -- the Oak Creek expansion units are currently on bituminous coal. So we really want to, as Gale mentioned in the script, we want to be able to burn blends of sub debt and bituminous coal. But with those units on bituminous coal, you can see those displaced in gas prices in the $3.50 to $3.75 range on bituminous coal. But if we can eventually get to high blends of sub-bituminous coal at those Oak Creek plants, I wouldn't see the displacement occurring until those much lower natural gas prices that I talked about, that $2.50 to $2.75.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And secondly, just a point of clarification, you expect O&M to be flat to up 2%, is that what you said?","Allen L. Leverett","For the year, that's our plan. Flat to plus 2%.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then lastly, how is April weather?","Gale E. Klappa","April weather, up until today, has been a bit chilly. But we're having 81 degrees and sunshine today. But we have had a chilly April.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Does your second quarter guidance bake that in and assume normal?","Gale E. Klappa","At the moment, because June also has a fair amount of air conditioning demand in our forecast, we've decided to simply stick with normal weather for our second quarter guidance.","Operator","Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just a few quick questions. First of all, I guess when we look at the Page 7 of the factors affecting earnings for the quarter, I wasn't really clear what the rate impact was. I mean it sounds like you guys had a rate increase beginning of the year. And just -- I don't see where that showed up.","Gale E. Klappa","All right. We'll let Pat or Steve give you the line time where it shows up we did have a rate increase. But we had a rate decrease for our natural gas distribution businesses. But a rate increase for our retail electric business. Steve?","Stephen P. Dickson","Yes, that's correct. And the rate increases were offset on electric side by costs. So that's how come it didn't fall through there. And on the gas side you said the decrease of the gas was offset by reduced O&M.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm sorry. Could you repeat that again?","Stephen P. Dickson","As Gale said, our rate increases were offset by cost increases and the decreases on the gas side were offset by cost decreases in O&M.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So -- but I mean just -- when I look at this, it looks like weather was a big driver obviously and if we take weather and the impact of leap year out, I mean -- I know there was depreciation, and what have you, but just on that operating level, it just seemed that the quarter -- that there was obviously something dragging it. I was just wondering what that might be.","Gale E. Klappa","Well, when you look at -- when say dragging it, I mean there were a number of things that entered back in to our O&M expenses. For example, last year as Pat mentioned, while we had a base rate freeze, we also had a regulatory amortization holiday. So we began -- although in some cases with a bit longer amortizing lives, we began flowing amortization back through our income statements. We obviously had just a touch of other costs. Basically, we're exactly on plan. I mean we're projecting 0% to 2% increase in O&M. That's where we are. The higher revenues are somewhat offset by various factors and yes, the weather, the share repurchases and the uptick at WE Power were the positive items that carried the day.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. I mean, I was still taking that into account. I'll follow-up offline, just maybe just my own math here. And then, when it comes to the depreciation lines, you guys said you did some study that helps out by $3 million in the quarter.","Gale E. Klappa","No.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm sorry. What was that then?","Gale E. Klappa","Steve can explain that.","Stephen P. Dickson","The depreciation, that's fairly simple. The depreciation as Pat mentioned in the remarks, the big driver there is the depreciation this year on the air quality-control project. That was over $800 million project and the depreciation, that was pretty significant on that. But I want to go back your question because it was a good question on where is the pricing in the factors. And this factors sheet just had the high-level items. On the electric side of the business, we had rate increase. On the gas side of the business as we said, it's a decrease. So those 2 basically wash. It's not that big. We're filing our 10Q Thursday afternoon and we'll have much more detail in that. But the short answer is, the rate increase on the electric was offset by the decline on the gas. Does that make sense?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Sure. And we'll check out the 10-Q. But I did think that you guys were lengthening the life -- the depreciable life of some assets. Did I get that wrong?","Gale E. Klappa","No. What we have -- no, you probably mistook something that was said. There's no significant difference in the depreciable lives of our assets.","Stephen P. Dickson","In 2012, we did a study on the new WE Power asset and in 2012 we made that change. But that's consistent '12 and '13. So that was something that happened in 2012.","Gale E. Klappa","We did a final study on the asset lives -- the depreciable lives of our new Power The Future units in 2012, but that should be, as Steve said, that should be -- what you're seeing in '13 should be completely comparable.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And that would be with synced up with rates, I would assume, right?","Gale E. Klappa","No. Because, WE Power being...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Got you. Okay, that makes sense. Okay, got you. And then in terms of the sales forecast and what have you, I don't want to always ask this question, but it does seem that -- it seems sort of weaker than expected. I mean, has there been any change in your outlook at all in terms of usage? I mean -- I know Greg know asked you a little bit about this on the industrial side, but I'm just wondering on the sort of the nonindustrial side? Any change in that at all?","Gale E. Klappa","No. And it's a good question and you're right to ask question. We sit back at look at the numbers and ask ourselves the same question. But if you kind of take a look at setting industrial side is you're asking us to do. Actually on a weather normal basis, we were better than we thought on residential. On a weather normal basis, we were a little bit worse than we thought on small commercial and industrial. But it's a 3-month period, and weather normalization is not that quite precise. So when we sit back and look at the mix of residential and small commercial and industrial, actually I think we're as well off, if not right on target to where we thought we would be after the first quarter.","Gale E. Klappa","All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you again for participating. If you have any other questions Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations office. That number is (414)221-2592. However, if an Italian opera singer answers. Please hang up.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time. ","Before the conference call begins, I'll remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.","During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call. And now it is my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Executive Chairman of WEC Energy Group.","Gale Klappa","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2019. First, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Kevin Fletcher, President and CEO; Scott Lauber, Chief Financial Officer; Bill Guc, our Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; Tony Reese, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Scott will discuss our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported full year 2019 earnings of $3.58 a share, and I'm pleased to report that we delivered a record year on virtually every meaningful measure of performance. Our customer satisfaction was swift recovery from severe July storms that caused extensive damage to our system. As we review our financial results, our balance sheet continues to strengthen. In fact, our ratio of holding company debt to total debt now stands at 28% that beats our 30% goal.","In 2019, we also eliminated regulatory assets for transmission costs, and we continued to leverage the benefits of tax reform for both customers and shareholders. In addition, we worked effectively to settle our Wisconsin rate reviews, which represent approximately 70% of our regulated assets. We also took our environmental efforts a step further. We set a new goal in 2019 to reduce the rate of methane emissions from our natural gas distribution system by 30% per mile by the year 2030. Our ongoing work to modernize Chicago's natural gas delivery network is key to achieving this goal, and we continue to analyze our climate-related risks and opportunities. In fact, the recent Moody's report focused on the risk exposure of regulated utilities to heat stress, water stress and extreme rainfall. I'm pleased to note that WEC Energy ranks among the lowest risk companies in our sector.","During 2019, we also reached a number of significant milestones in our Infrastructure segment. The Coyote Ridge Wind Farm is now in service in South Dakota and will contribute a full year of earnings in 2020. As you may recall Coyote Ridge consists of 39 turbines with a capacity of roughly 97 megawatts. We invested approximately $145 million for our 80% share of the windfarm and we\u2019re entitled to 99% of the tax benefits. As you know, a significant portion of our earnings from this facility come in the form of production tax credits. Project has a 12 year off-take agreement with Google Energy LLC for all of the energy produced. We also announced back in September that we will acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Thunderhead Wind Energy Center for $338 million. Invenergy is developing this project in Nebraska and we expect it to be in service at the end of 2020. The site will consist of 108 GE wind turbines with a combined capacity of 300 megawatts. The project has a long-term off-take agreement with AT&T for a 100% of the energy produced. We expect Thunderhead will qualify for production tax credits and a 100% bonus depreciation.","Then earlier this week, folks, we announced plans for another new development. We've agreed to acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Blooming Grove Wind Farm for $345 million. Invenergy is developing this project in Illinois with commercial operation expected to begin by the end of this year. The site will host 94 wind turbines with a total capacity of 250 megawatts. Blooming Grove has a 12 year off-take agreement with affiliates of two multinational companies with our investment grade. We expect that Blooming Grove will be eligible for a 100% bonus depreciation as well as production tax credits.","Overall, we're very encouraged about these investments in renewable energy, which will serve strong businesses for years to come. We expect a return on these investments to be higher than our regulated returns. Of course, we\u2019re being very selective as we vet future projects. We're only interested in projects that achieve our financial return metrics and do not change our risk profile.","Now let's take a brief look at the regional economy that\u2019s supporting our company's longer-term growth. Wisconsin's unemployment remains near record lows for the state and we continue to see strong economic development projects in the pipeline. Foxconn is moving forward with its plan to create a high-tech campus in Racine County, South of Milwaukee. Work on a Generation 6 fabrication plant for liquid crystal display screens is progressing. The fab, which spans about 1 million square feet is now enclosed and work is beginning on the internal structures. Foundations are also in place for a high-capacity data center. In addition, Foxconn has announced plans for a smart manufacturing facility. Construction crews began lifting the exterior walls into place for the smart manufacturing plant earlier this week. Based on public data, we estimate that Foxconn's investment in Wisconsin over the past two years has risen to approximately $500 million.","Turning a bit further South in the Kenosha area, Uline has announced plans to invest $130 million in two new facilities and bring approximately 350 new jobs to the area. Uline as you may know, is a leading distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging supplies with headquarters here in Wisconsin. In addition, Milwaukee Tool has announced another expansion. Milwaukee Tool will invest $100 million in a large multipurpose campus Northwest of the city in Menomonee Falls. The company also committed to adding 870 jobs in Wisconsin by the year 2025. These are exciting times. We look forward to more economic development and opportunity across the region.","Now, I'll turn the call over to Kevin for more insight on our operations and our regulatory calendar. Kevin, all yours.","Kevin Fletcher","Thank you, Gale. First, I'd like to share some good news. Our largest subsidiary, We Energies was named the most reliable electric utility in the Midwest for the ninth year running. Wisconsin Public Service also was recognized for the first time for outstanding reliability performance.","Now, I'll briefly review where we stand in our four state jurisdictions. As you\u2019ll recall, in March of last year, we filed a proposal with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin to set customer rates for We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. And in August, we entered into settlement agreements with the Citizens Utility Board of Wisconsin, the Wisconsin Industrial Energy Group and Clean Wisconsin. On December the 19th, the Commission issued its written order of firming those settlement agreements and setting rates for the next two years. New rates went into effect on January the 1st.","During 2019, we also continued to make progress in developing solar generation for our regulated businesses in Wisconsin. You may recall that in Wisconsin we're planning a total of 300 megawatts of utility scale solar capacity, the first facilities of this size in the state. We\u2019ve broken ground on two solar projects for Wisconsin Public Service, Two Creeks and Badger Hollow launch. Our share will total 200 megawatts for an expected investment of approximately $260 million. Both projects are scheduled to begin producing energy by the end of this year. And this past August, at We Energies we filed with the Wisconsin Commission for approval to acquire 100 megawatts of capacity at the Badger Hollow II Solar Farm. The projected investment would be $130 million. We expect to receive the Commission's decision this spring.","We also see efficient natural gas storage, another important part of our regulated business strategy. In particular Wisconsin needs more natural gas peaking capacity at the highest demand times on the coldest days. We're continuing to evaluate site plans for two liquefied natural gas facilities to help to meet our customers\u2019 needs during the winter peak. We expect to invest approximately $370 million in these projects. If approved by the Wisconsin Commission, construction is expected to begin in the summer of 2021.","Turning to Illinois, we continue making progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. This program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe and reliable. We're approximately 28% complete with our replacement of outdated, corroded natural gas piping, some of which was installed more than a century ago. We continue to project an investment of $280 million to $300 million per year on average in this program.","Now, let's turn to Michigan. In 2019, we completed our new natural gas-fired power plants in Michigan's Upper Peninsula on time and on budget. These plants are now providing a cost-effective, long-term power supply for our customers in the Upper Peninsula. With these new units operating, we were able to retire our older, less efficient coal-fired plant at Presque Isle. This resulted in significant operations and maintenance savings and reduced CO2 emissions.","Taking a broader look across our business, we continue to focus on operating efficiency and financial discipline. As a whole, we exceeded our 2019 goal to reduce our day-to-day operation and maintenance costs. Our goal was a reduction of 4% and we actually achieved a 7% reduction. We have set a goal to further reduce our O&M by an incremental 2% to 3% in 2020 as well.","And with that, I'll turn it back to Gale.","Gale Klappa","Kevin, thank you very much. As you'll recall, ladies and gentlemen, our 2020 guidance is in a range of $3.71 a share to $3.75 a share. This translates to an earnings growth of between 6% and 7.1% of our 2019 base of $3.50 a share. Recall, $3.50 a share was the midpoint of our original guidance for 2019. ","And finally, a word about our dividend policy. At its January meeting, our Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend of 63.25 cents a share for the first quarter of 2020. That's an increase of 7.2%. New quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $2.53 a share. This marks the 17th consecutive year that our company will reward shareholders with higher dividends. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. We are right in the middle of that range now and so I expect our dividend growth will continues to be in line with the growth in our earnings per share.","And now, with details on our 2019 results and our outlook for 2020 is our CFO, Scott Lauber. Scott?","Scott Lauber","Thank you, Gale. Our 2019 earnings for $3.58 per share increased $0.24 per share compared to 2018, a 7.2% increase. In 2019, we benefited from additional capital investment, reduction in tax credit and continued emphasis on cost control. While all of our utilities met their financial goals, our Wisconsin utilities earned their fully-allowed ROE and customers will see the benefit going forward through the sharing mechanism. We posted the earnings packet to our website this morning. It includes a comparison of fourth quarter and full-year results. My focus will be on the full year, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. ","Referring to Page 10 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for 2019 was $1.530 billion as compared to operating income of $1.470 billion in 2018, an increase of $63 million.","Recall that as part of our previous rate settlement in Wisconsin, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory assets. The plan continued through year-end. And as we expected, the transmission escrow asset balance at We Energies was eliminated. My update will focus on changes in operating income by segment excluding the impact of tax repairs and our adoption of the new lease accounting rules.","Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income increased $42 million net of these adjustments. Lower operation and maintenance expense resulted in approximately $105 million increase in operating income driven by efficiencies and effective cost control across the enterprise. This positive impact on operating income was largely offset by a few items. First, lower sales volume due to primarily cooler summer weather conditions accounted for approximately $26 million decrease in operating income. Second, depreciation and amortization increased $35 million as we continued to execute on our capital plan. And finally, operating income was reduced by a $22 million tax item that flow through operating. This was fully offset by a reduction in tax expense.","In Illinois, operating income increased by $36 million, primarily as a result of our continued investment in the safety and reliability of the Peoples Gas System. Operating income at our other state segment decreased $3.5 million.","Turning now to our Energy Infrastructure segment. Operating income at this segment was up $800,000 driven by additional investment in our Power the Future plans. As expected, the Bishop Hill, Upstream and Coyote Ridge Wind Farms did not have a material impact on operating income. Recall, a significant portion of earnings from these wind farms come in the form of production tax credits, which are recognized as an offset to income tax expense. These production tax credits contributed approximately $0.08 per share to our earnings for the year compared to $0.01 in 2018.","The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment increased by $12 million. This variance reflects a $5.3 million gain that we recorded in 2018 related to the sale of a legacy business, as well as an impairment recorded in the fourth quarter of 2019 on assets that we inherited from the Integrys acquisition.","Combining these variances and excluding the impact of tax repairs and the new lease rules, consolidated operating income increased $62.8 million. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled over $128 million, a decrease of $9.1 million as compared to 2018. Our earnings from ATC decreased by $19 million as a result of a recent FERC order addressing the MISO complaints. Going forward, we're recording ATC earnings, assuming a 10.38% return on equity. This includes a 50 basis point added for our participation in MISO.","Other income net increased by $32 million driven by investment gains associated with our benefit plans. Note that these investment gains partially offset the benefit expense included in our operating segment. The remaining increase relates to the non-service cost component of our pension and benefit plans. Our net interest expense increased by $53 million, mostly due to higher long-term debt balances to fund the capital investment. This excludes the impact of the new lease guidance. ","Our consolidated income tax expense, net of tax repairs, decreased by $42 million. The major drivers were production tax credits from our wind investments and the 2018 tax reform item that I mentioned earlier. Our 2019 effective tax rate was 9.9%. Excluding the benefits of tax repairs, our 2019 effective tax rate would have been 20.6%. Looking forward, we expect that 2020 effective tax rate to be in the range of 16% to 17%. This includes the effects of the unprotected tax benefits that are being refunded to customers following our recent Wisconsin rate decision. Excluding these benefits, we expect our 2020 effective tax rate to be between 20% and 21%. At this time, we expect to be a modest taxpayer in 2020. Our projection show that we will be able to efficiently utilize our tax position with our capital plan.","Turning to our cash flow statement. Our FFO-to-debt was 18.5% in 2019. Looking ahead, we expect FFO-to-debt to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(NYSE:K) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Total capital expenditures and asset acquisitions were $2.5 billion in 2019, a $112 million increase from 2018. ","Turning now to sales.","We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of 2019, our utilities were serving approximately 10,000 more electric and 14,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings packet. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine were down 2.8% compared to 2018, and at a weather-normal basis, deliveries were down 1.7%.","Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 2.6% versus 2018 and by 1.8% on a weather-normal basis. This excludes gas used for power generation. ","And now I'll briefly touch on our 2020 sales forecast for our Wisconsin segment. We are forecasting a slight decrease of one-half of 1% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries, excluding the iron ore mine. We project the Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries to increase by seven-tenth of 1%. This excludes gas used for power generation, and of course, both of these projections are adjusted for leap year in 2020.","Finally, let's look at our guidance for the first quarter of 2020. Last year, we earned $1.33 per share in the first quarter. As you recall, this included approximately $0.04 related to the colder-than-normal weather in 2019. Factoring in this and the 16% warmer-than-normal January, we project first quarter 2020 earnings to be in the range of $1.32 per share to a $1.34 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.","And with that, I will turn the things back to Gale.","Gale Klappa","Scott, thank you very much. Overall, we're continuing to perform at a high level, on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. ","Operator, we're ready now to open it up for the question-and-answer portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Your line is open. ","Shahriar Pourreza","So let me -- just a couple questions here. You guys are backfilling this infrastructure capital budget relatively fast especially with last week's acquisition. What's the spending shape look like given sort of these recent opportunities i.e. is there any opportunities to provide upside to your current guide or is this just kind of an acceleration of that spend? And then Scott, I know you mentioned on the cash tax position being a partial payer. But does that include last week's acquisition? Just wanted to get a little bit of clarity there.","Gale Klappa","Well, Shahriar, we will be happy to answer those questions. First, I would view our announcement this week on Blooming Grove, basically an acceleration of a five year plan. If you kind of looked at what we've accomplished so far with what we believe are very high quality projects, we're almost -- we're about 38% already in terms of the projects that we've agreed to acquire, right about 38% of the spending we projected at our five year plan. But I would view it as an acceleration and I will tell you why. Our five year plan, which projected about $1.8 billion in this particular segment of capital spending essentially was a happy marriage of the high quality projects that we saw, that we really had a strong interest in, coupled with our ability to utilize all of the tax benefits. If you put all that together, it kind of shook out at $1.8 billion. So Scott, I would view this as an acceleration.","Scott Lauber","Right. It's just it's just the timing. And when you look at the tax position, and we see a very small taxpayer, it\u2019s going to be under $15 million, $20 million, because of the tax rules, there are still some tax payments that are made. But as you know, we're slowly starting with the PTC's work into 2021 1Q. So that'll not be a full taxpayer in 2021. But still when you look at our five year plan, a lot of capacity is on our tax side. ","Gale Klappa","And Shahriar remember, this particular wind farm doesn't come into service until the very end of 2020. ","Shahriar Pourreza ","And then just on the regulated renewable, there's obviously a lot that you're doing there. Can I just get a sense on how this could impact your decision to exercise the West Riverside option to purchase maybe up to 200 megawatts of that plant? Is there sort of a read-through on that option, and whether you would exercise it?","Gale Klappa","No, I wouldn't do any read-through on that. That is still something that we're analyzing, still something we're taking a look at. As we continue to review our demand forecasts, our needs, the impact of renewables, but that is still something that's on the tables Shahriar.","Shahriar Pourreza","And then just lastly, Gale, a little bit more of a policy question. I mean obviously we had a Commission announcement last -- a couple of weeks ago around resignation. So we're obviously likely going to see a bit of a democratic shift with Evers\u2019 appointment. Is there kind of any read-throughs that we should be thinking about from a policy standpoint as it looks like the majority may change, business as usual or could this kind of accelerate some of the solar decarbonization plans that are out there?","Gale Klappa","My own sense is, I would look at any additional appointments of the Commission largely as business as usual. But I will say, and remind everyone that the Governor has appointed a climate task force. He has announced a aspirational goal late last year to basically have carbon-free electricity by 2050. In this task force in which our company is represented, had its actual first meeting just a week or so ago. So, during this year, I think you will see some policy recommendations related to decarbonization coming out of this task force. In many ways the Public Service Commission would in all probability need to implement some of those policy changes that they were adopted. But the policy shift that I would see coming, if there is one, would really come through the Governor's task force on climate change, if that makes sense to you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon","Can we unpack the O&M performance a little bit because it really is quite impressive? If I look at Page 8 of your release, I think you\u2019re telling me I should be looking at the O&M as adjusted for impact of the flow-through of tax repairs, right? That's like the clean number.","Scott Lauber","Yes. That's right.","Greg Gordon","And it\u2019s down dramatically. And although more so I think because when I look at the rabbi trust activity, that's basically offset in O&M by an offsetting adjustment in O&M. So, if I adjust it for the rabbi trust activity, the O&M comparison would be even better than it looks, is that -- I think that's correct. And if so, can you unpack for us what the sort of structural savings are that are now flowing through on a full year basis from the activities you pursued or sort of permanent benefits? And I think there's more to come with the investments you've made in technology and things like that. So, I am just wondering, A, what's the structural improvement in O&M and where they do come from? And B, what the follow-on from continued activities on that front?","Gale Klappa","Would be happy to. Let me frame all of this for you and then we're going to let Scott and Kevin weigh in on some of details. But we did have an exceptional quarter in terms of continued efficiencies across the business and there are a couple of factors that I think are important here. The first is that, during 2019, we saw essentially pretty much a full-year benefit of the implementation of our ERP system across the entire enterprise. So, that was helpful. And we're continuing -- as people get used to that new system, we're continuing to see efficiencies and benefits that we thought we would. And then compared to Q4 of a year ago, compared to Q4 of 2018 for example, there were there were significant O&M savings related to the closer of coal fired power plants. Remember in -- we've basically over the last several months, in year and a half or so, we've retired three old or less efficient coal fired power plants, units at Presque Isle, up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan where the latest to be retired in the spring of 2019. We have the Pulliam plant near Green Bay retired and we had Pleasant Prairie retired. So we're seeing -- in the fourth quarter we saw O&M benefits flow through from no longer having to incur O&M for the operation of those plants. ","Then we had some of our technology investments continue to kick in. And as Kevin said, we're projecting additional O&M savings that we think we're going to gain here. And we're on track to gain in 2020. So Scott, Kevin, anything you\u2019d like to add. ","Kevin Fletcher ","You already mentioned the ERP. If you look at common platforms across our system in the fourth quarter of this year, we will complete our customer information system to have that across all of our companies. We have already seen even this past year some savings from what we had in place already. But in addition to that, through last year and focusing on the future, just looking at process improvement, so as we look across like the jurisdictions, do benchmarking, we're looking at common standards and where it makes sense, so to have a proactive and the similar approaches across our system. That has produced some positive results for us on our O&M reduction, and it will continue to. ","Gale Klappa","Scott?","Scott Lauber ","I don't think there is anything else. It is across the enterprise, though. Everyone has a O&M takeout, opportunities and efficiencies to gain. ","Gale Klappa","And we're doing that Greg, which I'm very pleased about and I thought we would be able to. We're doing that while increasing customer satisfaction. So that's one of the reasons I mentioned earlier in my remarks. As we tracked our operational and financial performance, we had a record year across virtually every meaningful measure of performance. ","Greg Gordon","So there is an incremental improvement on run rate O&M as you get to the sort of fully baked savings from the coal plant closures. And then there's incremental O&M benefits but from the -- that you think you'll get from the ERP and also from the rollout of the CIS amongst other things. ","Gale Klappa","You nailed it. That's exactly right. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","So just following up on Greg's question here. I think that's really germane. Can we dig in a little bit further to the prospects to sustain these levels of cost reductions? I mean they're really quite dramatic. I mean I think Greg emphasized it enough. But the point being, how sustainable are these given how outsized they appear to be relative to the balance, not just on a trailing basis but prospectively for \u201820 here as you think through the balance of your playing period. And maybe even to push the point a bit further, how identified is it just -- not just in '20, but through the balance of the year financial period that you're forecasting in terms of these levels of reductions?","Gale Klappa","Well, I'll take a stab at that, certainly Scott can add anything he would like to and Kevin as well. But let me say this, we believe and I think our track record demonstrates that the kind of cost savings that you saw, that we continue to believe we're going to continue on a downward path, those are very sustainable. We wouldn't be publicly committing to them if we didn't think we could absolutely sustain them. So again, we took 7% of the day-to-day O&M out of the business in 2019, 2% to 3% projected reduction in 2020. And again, we're doing this I think in a very highly planned and deliberate way. And a good chunk of it is coming really from two areas. One we mentioned before that we're getting the full benefit of now, and that's the O&M takeout from the closure of less efficient coal-fired power plants. The other is the investment in technology. So my view guys would be highly sustainable. ","Kevin Fletcher","Gale, I'd agree, we just mentioned a couple of things that we're doing, but let me add one more on the customer service side, though, we have and are investing in our AMI infrastructure and we've seen savings from having that in place to reduce the rolls of truck that will continue. And we'll see those opportunities ahead in the upcoming years. Also leveraging technology like mobile apps as an example, as we get that out into our customers we will be able to have more interaction with our customers and give them opportunities to pay their bills online, minimize paper billing, things of that nature. So I would agree that sustainability of that is built into a lot of what we're doing on customer service side, especially with the things that I just mentioned.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Let me if I can please, to jump a little further. What about the compounding nature of that trajectory right? 2% to 3% is impressive, but through your forecast, do you anticipate compounding of that trajectory? And then perhaps the really relevant second question is, you've done it before. How do we think about the cadence of rate cases? I know we're getting out a little bit but just given the scale of cost reductions here, certainly the question doesn't seem too early in terms of across any one of your jurisdictions given the enterprise wide cost reductions that are contemplated here? I mean, i.e., pushing them out.","Gale Klappa","I'm chuckling because we just got through the rate reviews for 70% of our regulated assets. ","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","I know, I recognize it but then the cost reductions are incredible. ","Gale Klappa","Well, we appreciate that. Let me say this, historically, as you know, in Wisconsin, the Commission has liked and has really requested in every two year cadence for rate reviews. But that's not to say that set in concrete. We'll take a look at it as we go forward and see where we are, see where the Commission\u2019s sentiment is, et cetera. But long story short, we feel very good about our ability to execute. And again, do so in a way that maintains high reliability and high levels of customer satisfaction.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay, too early to tell. ","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Sullivan with Wolfe Research. ","Michael Sullivan","Just one more on the O&M. What do you guys assume for earned ROEs now that you've got this kind of different sharing band where you can over earn a little bit before you get back to customers. Where does this -- these O&M savings targets put you on a earned ROE basis? ","Gale Klappa","We're assuming as we have in the past that we earn the allowed rates of return in each one of our retail jurisdictions.","Michael Sullivan","Okay. Sorry, just to clarify, is that like at the electric utilities, is it 10%, or up to the 10.25% that you can do before sharing?","Gale Klappa","Right now we're assuming 10%.","Michael Sullivan","Okay. And then over to the sales growth. So, I think for 2020, electric, you're forecasting down a little bit and if we go back to some of your EEI slides, there\u2019s supposed to be a tick up in the next couple years and more so as you get into \u201822, \u201823. Can you just give us some color around key milestones that we should be looking for on economic growth that that's going to reach that from down a little bit to up close to overall percent?","Gale Klappa","Yes. Happy to, Michael. First of all, the uptick that we continue to project -- and it\u2019s a pretty slight uptick, the uptick that we're projecting in the 2022, 2023 timeframe is really driven by the amazing economic development projects that I talked about a little earlier in our remarks. We have not seen any slowdown in terms of the number of economic development projects, the amount of new construction, just the continuing economic growth or the pipeline of projects that are being announced here in Southeastern Wisconsin in particular. So, we still feel pretty confident about the uptick in the longer-term. The shorter-term meaning for 2020, is really driven by like for example, the large industrial segment. It's really driven by the interviews that our people have with our key account customers and feedback into our projections. It's also driven a bit by weather normalization. Remember, we had two warmer-than-normal summers back-to-back. So you look at weather normalization, you look at conservation, you look at real-time feedback from our major industrial customers and you put it all together and it's like it's in there, that's what comes out. So, in total, a very modest decline, I believe Scott one-half of 1% is what we're projecting on retail absent the mines.","Scott Lauber","Correct. So, a very modest decline. And once again, the projections that we have in the investor book are really the only projects that we know. It doesn't include the residential and secondary that we expect to come from it. It's just the known projects that have actually started turning curve already. So, it just takes a while to build a building and start using it. So, we expect those -- those are still on track to become. And like Gale said, our forecast is really out there talking to our customers and really fine-tuning it and the information we have, it\u2019s the best information we have. ","Gale Klappa ","And we are still projecting -- even with the modest 0.5% decline, we're still projecting 6% to 7% EPS growth.","Operator","Your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta","So, maybe just I guess the O&M point has been already debated and answered. So, appreciate that. I think on the energy infrastructure side, the $1.8 billion that was planned, you said you accelerated it with this latest acquisition. Do you expect with the tax appetite being what it is further down the road, do you expect that size increase through the 2024 timeframe, or do you expect the 1.8% to still will be the cap?","Gale Klappa","At the moment, again, we will continue to look at this. But at the moment, I would view this as an acceleration and the $1.8 billion for the 5 years is still what we're looking at.","Praful Mehta","And then, when we think about the tax appetite and you said that you would be small tax payer, how should we think about that taxpaying capacity in the '22, '24 timeframe? Is that you\u2019re still a small tax payer at that point or is that capacity increasing over time?","Gale Klappa","Well, when you still look and you work everything in, we would still be a small taxpayer getting into that, being in that frame of time if we execute on all these capital projects, largely because of some of the tax rules that are out there, you still have to be a minimal taxpayer for some of the reasons. But we need to execute on all these capital projects to get to that level.","Kevin Fletcher","Given the tax rules as Scott said, it\u2019s highly unlikely that we will ever in a sustained period of time get to absolute zero. So when we say modest taxpayer, for example, I think Scott mentioned $15 million to $20 million this year. So I hope that puts things in context for you.","Praful Mehta","Yes, no, it does and I appreciate that. And then just finally, in terms of credit, and the holdco debt side, I think you started by saying you've got improving credit, and your holdco debt is now down to 28%. Is there any target we should be thinking about around the holdco debt level and also the FFO-to-debt kind of credit that we should be thinking more longer term?","Gale Klappa","We\u2019ll let Scott answer that. We do have an internal an internal cap on where we want to go or where we don't want to go with holdco credit -- holdco debt. ","Scott Lauber ","So we look at that holdco, that holdco debt, it's down to 28%. Our target is to keep it below 30%. Now, if there's an opportunity, one year it may pop up or down, but -- and we feel comfortable of those ranges in our forecast here. And the FFO-to-debt in that 16 to 18 range. Now, last year, we had 18.5 but remember we were at in a sharing opportunity at Wisconsin utilities, that money will go back eventually to customers. So, next year may be on the lower end of that range, but still within that 16 to 18 range. ","Gale Klappa","And that range as you know, well supports our current credit ratings.","Operator","Our next question comes from Andrew Weisel with Scotiabank. Your line is open. ","Andrew Weisel","Just want to elaborate on the contracted infrastructure projects. So as of now what percent of 2020 EPS will come from that segment? And let's assume the five year plan stays at 1.8, it seems like the bias might be to the upside, what percent of earnings would be coming from that segment in five years?","Gale Klappa","Well I can give you the number for this year. And obviously, well, we can do a little bit of public math here. But long story short, we got in 2019 about $0.02 a quarter of earnings from our infrastructure investments. Given the addition this year, a full year earnings for Coyote Ridge which went into service at the end of 2019, I would expect about $0.03 a quarter, Scott?","Scott Lauber","About $0.03 a quarter. And remember the other projects we announced here in December of next year. So some impact but not a lot. ","Andrew Weisel","And then bigger picture, how big are you willing to let that segment be? Obviously they're high quality contracted assets. But they're not the regulated rate base contracts. So do you have sort of a mental ceiling of how big that could be as far as earnings mix? ","Gale Klappa","Yes, we do. At the moment, I would say that our internal plan would hold that segment of our business down to about 10% of our earnings.","Andrew Weisel","Okay, very good. Then just one last one on that same topic. You said you've accelerated the spending, but you're not increasing it. What's the limiting factor of why you're not increasing it? Is it balance sheet opportunity for specific projects? Is it that 10% ceiling you just mentioned? How do you balance those? ","Gale Klappa","It's the happy marriage between the quality projects that we see in the pipeline that we are very interested in, and our tax appetite. If you put it all together and the $1.8 billion shakes out to something that we can -- we think we can both add quality projects to achieve and maximize our tax position.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein","Just on the last round of questioning, is there a reason why you won't -- or you aren't considering tax equity for continued expansion, considering the tax upside? ","Gale Klappa","No, I mean certainly we would be open to something like that in the future if the economics worked out. Right now the economics favor exactly what we're doing. ","Michael Weinstein","Got you. And on ATC, has there been any impact on long-term planning from the FERC's action on ROE in MISO. ","Gale Klappa","Short answer is no. And I think that\u2026 ","Michael Weinstein","You don\u2019t think that had an effect? ","Gale Klappa ","Not yet because, as you know, it's now all up in the air again. So, these are -- as you know very well, transmission projects have a long gestation period. So, I wouldn't expect there to be some kind of a knee-jerk reaction in the first 30 or 60 days, particularly with all the appeals going on and the uncertainty of what the final result will be. ","Kevin Fletcher","Exactly Gale, and we're recording a 10.38, remember that long-term plan, we were assuming 10.2. So, 10.38 is a little north of that.","Michael Weinstein","And I may have missed this before, but where do you guys stand in terms of dividend payout ratio targets? And what's the future growth rate for dividends, is it just going to track along with EPS at this point? ","Kevin Fletcher","Our policy is to pay out in a range of 65% to 70% of earnings. So a dividend payout ratio that is 65% to 70% of earnings. As I mentioned earlier, we right smacked that in the middle of that range right now. So we would project that dividend growth would be in-line with the growth in earnings per share.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with GS. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides","Hey, Gale, thank you for taking my question. Congrats on a great quarter. I actually have several, they're all gas related, and I'll just kind of rattle them off. First of all, your gas demand forecast of, I think, it's 0.7%. Can you remind me when the last time you did sub-1% gas demand growth in Wisconsin? That's the first question. The second question is, where do you stand on the permitting and regulatory approval for their gas LNG facility at Wisconsin that you talked about a couple of months ago or a while ago? And then finally, any incremental thoughts on the need for new gas fired generation, either as partly transformation we're just meet demand part? ","Kevin Fletcher","All right, we'll be happy to try to take those up one by one. I think weather-normal, we were at 1.8 on retail gas. So we had a 1.8% growth in retail gas consumption on a weather-normal basis in 2019. You could probably go back in terms of when were we last below 1%. Whatever year that gas -- natural gas prices got to double-digits, I think we did not grow meaningfully at all in terms of natural gas demand from the retail side of the business. Scott?","Scott Lauber","Yes, exactly. When you think about it, yes, we've had 3% to 4% growth last year it was 1.8%. But now what we're really forecasting is really the customer growth aspect, not assuming any more conservation, but also assuming that people don't turn their houses from 69 to 74. People are going to stay comfortable. And we've also seen a lot of conversions the last couple of years from industrial for their own environmental goals to go convert from coal and oil to natural gas, so you only convert only once. So basically our forecast now is based on customer growth.","Gale Klappa","And Michael on the LNG as far as the approval process, it's underway. And as I said in my prepared comments, we expect approval and we would begin construction in the summer of 2021 for operations in 2023.","Michael Lapides","And then on the gas intervention side and kind of thinking about the mix of gas versus coal fired generation?","Gale Klappa","Mix of gas versus coal fired?","Michael Lapides","In terms of thinking about new gas generation needs\u2026","Gale Klappa","Well, as you know, we have an option with Alliant to buy into some point between now and say 2024 a portion of their new gas-fired combined cycle that's being built right now. That option is still on the table. We haven't made a final decision. Beyond that, we don't have any plans to propose any construction of new gas-fired generation. And of course, regardless of whether we add gas-fired generation or not, the percentage of gas-fired generation in our total mix will be going up and coal will be coming down as we've already retired about 40% of our existing coal-fired generating capacity.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Your line is open.","Greg Gordon"," I just wanted to go back to the comment on what your expectations are as they sort of bake into your earnings growth aspiration, the 5 to 7. You said that you're targeting the authorized ROE without and not assuming that you maximize your opportunity to get into the higher end of the range. Should we assume that the midpoint of your guidance represents earning the authorized return and sort of like the high-end represents the ability to achieve other factors like earning that extra 25 basis points? Or if I'm not thinking about it correctly, can you give us some guidance as how you're thinking about that opportunity and what it might mean for your earnings outlook?","Gale Klappa","Great question, Greg. Everyone in the room is nodding their head, you've got it. If we were modeling it, as we know you would be, we would assume fully authorized rate of return gets us to the midpoint of the guidance and then upside from there if we were to get into sharing.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Michael Weinstein","One last question I forgot to ask this. This is more of a strategic question. But around the country, you are seeing some cities ban improvements on natural gas distribution systems and pulling through full electrification of heating and everything else. And obviously the views from the Upper Midwest winter is little bit different than place like California. But do you have any view on where this all is going in terms of natural gas infrastructure, spending and you guys are -- you're kind of the experts of the turnaround business there.","Gale Klappa","Well, it's a very good question, and I think you are correct. In the less -- in the warmer climate and the more tempered climates, there's clearly a push by some of the more active environmentalists, not only move away from coal but now we have a beyond gas campaign that we're seeing. For us, I think Michael it comes back to pure practicality and the recognition that if it's 40 below in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a heat pump is simply not going to keep your house warm, or even if it did, it would be so incredibly expensive that you simply couldn't deal with it.","So for our Upper Midwest area and with the market share that we have for home and commercial heating with natural gas, I just don't see a major turn away from that for many, many years to come. I think the other piece of it is natural gas heating, natural gas furnaces continue to get even more efficient. And there are better ways, I think in terms of running the economy and continuing to reduce CO2 emissions.","And if you look now at across the U.S. and in the upper Midwest, the number one contributor to CO2 emissions is no longer power generation, for example, it's transportation. I think the low hanging fruit here in terms of continuing to de-carbonize the economy, particularly in a region like the one we serve, is not moving away from natural gas home heating, it's actually electrification for vehicles. Kevin, I don't know if you have any view on that.","Kevin Fletcher","Gale, I think you summed it up very well. The other thing that I just will add is as technology continues to evolve on the gas side we'll continue to be in a part of that and looking at it. But I think you summarized our position and our philosophy very well.","Gale Klappa","Hope that responds to your question, Michael.","Michael Weinstein","Great, thank you very much. Talk to you soon.","Operator","You next question comes from Vedula Murti with Avon Capital. Your line is open. ","Vedula Murti","I wanted to make sure I understood, because there's a line item and I just want to make sure you can explain it to me. Can you explain to me what kind of how the rabbi trust works kind of how its funded, it's duration and kind of how it replicate itself over supplies?","Gale Klappa","Sure. We'll be happy to take a stab at it. I'm going to let Scott do that. I will say this we have to make sure that all of you don't look at the rabbi trust in isolation. As in many ways, the rabbi trust is -- the earnings in the rabbi trust offset the cost of some of our benefit plans. And I think conceptually that's an important point to remember. Scott?","Scott Lauber","Yes, that's exactly right Gale. So the rabbi trust is really set up by Integrys and we inherited that investment vehicle. And that is related to some of the deferred compensation that individuals from Integrys have earned through the years. So what's a rabbi trust does is what we do is we try to match the best we can, the expense of deferred comp that's in the utilities with the investments in this rabbi trust. So if the rabbi trust goes up $1, usually the deferred comp expense goes up $1 or vice versa. So it's really trying to match that.","We have those funds. They're tied up specifically for the deferred comp, so there's nothing else we can use for them. So we have to do it and we thought the best thing to do was try to mirror and match the hedging as much as possible. Like Gail said though, you can't look at it in isolation. Just for accounting purposes, it has to be on this line how it\u2019s recorded.","Gale Klappa","And Vedula, so far and again we've inherited that in 2015 with the Integrys acquisition. So far our strategies, our matching strategy, if you will, has","our matching strategy, if you will, is worked exceptionally well.","Vedula Murti","So as I think about this, is the variance here tied to stock market performance, performance of Wisconsin Equity, Wisconsin Energy, the equity specifically? Or what creates the variances, both up and down in this?","Gale Klappa","And again, we'll let Scott give you more detail. But long story short, we know what investment options are people who've got the deferred comp are in. In other words, we know what investment options they have selected. We can blend that with our investment options in the rabbi trust.","Scott Lauber","And a lot of the investment options are dealing with equities in the deferred comp, and that's what we're trying to match it the best we can. It's not perfect. But the best we can with equities in the rabbi trust. And so far the correlation has been pretty high\u2026","Gale Klappa","99% and really good\u2026","Vedula Murti","And so this is a static thing going forward, there's no new participants or incremental?","Gale Klappa","No new participant\u2026","Scott Lauber","It's static and it slowly goes down as participants withdraw from the old Integrys deferred comp. So it's slowly going down.","Vedula Murti","And I guess also I guess then the other thing, obviously, this is clearly part of strategies in terms of the income tax expense line in terms of the wind credits and everything like that. Clearly, if we take a look at Page 10, say major, that's a very important positive factor and year-over-year is very large increase. How should we be thinking about that in terms of within the earnings guidance range variance going forward there?","Gale Klappa","We can certainly give you the comparison of what we achieved in terms of the infrastructure segment earnings in 2019 versus our projection in 2020. As I mentioned earlier, the infrastructure segment gave us about $0.02 a share uptick in earnings each quarter during 2019. And with the addition of Coyote Ridge Wind Farm in South Dakota, which went commercial at the end of last year and will give us a full year this year, we would expect $0.03 a quarter from the infrastructure investments in wind.","Scott Lauber","Yes. And I think overall when you look at it, including the unprotected we're giving back in the credits to our customers, that effective tax rate is in that 16% to 17% range.","Gale Klappa","And to clarify, what's going to be an incremental penny a quarter in 2020 in terms of the earnings.","Vedula Murti","So given the fully diluted share count, it would appear then that that variance should be something similar not as dramatic year-over-year?","Gale Klappa","Yes, that's exactly right.","Operator","And your next question comes from Andrew Levi with Exoduspoint.","Andrew Levi","So just kind of following Michael Weinstein's question, and just on kind of natural gas, I guess -- and you kind of answered it already. But I would say just in the context of ESG and obviously, ESG is not to be favoring natural gas. So maybe just explain how you with that? And then separately, I agree with everything that you have said earlier about nat gas. Just kind of looking at kind of the last step and if you look at LDCs or companies that are very heavy natural gas, their stocks have not done as well of lately and the multiples have come down. And so I'm just wondering kind of where your head is at? And at the right price, would you add gas distribution customers to your mix beyond what you have already obviously in the large LDC in Illinois and the smaller ones in Wisconsin?","Gale Klappa","Well, good question, Andy. You know you never say never, but let me put it this way. At the right price, obviously, hitting the free that we've talked about for acquisitions, and we would always take a hard look. I would go because you recognized if you're making an acquisition of any kind of company, LDC or not, you are basically making a very long-term bet. Our assets, as you know, are very long-lived assets. So would, and I'm saying this just theoretically. If an LDC in the Northern North Dakota came up for sale at the right price, we probably would be a lot more interested in that than if it was in the San Diego.","Andrew Levi","And just as far as ESG and how you kind of think maybe, obviously, it's an evolving idea or investment basis. Do you think as far as natural gas, they've gone for an update but it may not be the right way to look at it and there are other things to focus on the ESG side?","Gale Klappa","Well, again a good question, Andy. My sense and we've done dozens of ESG business. Right now, and I think for the foreseeable future, the ESG focus infrastructure companies like ours, seems to be heavily, heavily focused on CO2 emissions and what your plan is to basically decarbonize the generation fleet. That swamps any other kind of discussion that we have had with any ESG-oriented investor. And again, we have hundreds of these discussions over the course of the last couple years.","In fact, everyone now, whether you are ESG focused or not, everyone is beginning to ask ESG questions. But I would say that in 99 out of 100 meetings, the real focus is really on CO2 emissions and there we've got a great story to tell. The other thing that I would point out, we're one of the first utilities in the country to set a methane reduction goal.","And I think you are going to be seeing, because the climate scientists, as you know, really believe that methane emissions are far, far more potent perhaps 25 times more potent than CO2 as a greenhouse gas, I think you are going to be seeing some increasing focus on methane emissions and they are the kind of upgrade work we're doing to modernize the natural gas distribution network, particularly in Chicago is really important. So those are the kinds of -- that's the flavor of what we're hearing in our ESG business today, Andy.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Your line is open.","Paul Patterson","So let me ask you something here, just to follow up on Vedula's question. The rabbi trust, if I understand your answers, basically is offset by deferred comp expense to do really isn't any net income benefit of any significance you see driving earnings going forward or in terms of results for 2019. Am I understanding it correctly?","Gale Klappa","Correct. 2019 may have been an anomaly because we have so much O&M coming out of the utility that we're into the sharing. But for the most part, there's no benefit from that at all. But it would have been a small amount, and nothing Paul that we're planning on in terms of benefit for 2020.","Paul Patterson","And then in terms of Foxconn, there's some local articles about the Foxconn administration, looking at renegotiating the tax benefits, because of I guess the way the Foxconn thing has been sort of rolling out. And I'm just wondering if you had anything to share on that, or what does that mean in terms of the outlook for the Foxconn economic development contributions that you guys have been expecting past this?","Gale Klappa","And let me let me just reiterate first what I mentioned in our prepared remarks. In that over the past two years, Foxconn has invested already over $500 million in Wisconsin. I can tell you, again, I've said before focus on what's going on the campus rather than the media reports. But I can tell you, I was actually with the governor yesterday. He and I appeared together at an economic development conference here in Milwaukee. And he went out of his way to say that he believes his responsibility is to help make Foxconn successful in Wisconsin. So again, that's as of 9:30 yesterday morning and a very definitive comment from the governor himself.","Paul Patterson","And then finally the wind transaction with Google as the off-take, that's for the life of the project. Is that correct?","Gale Klappa","So that would be a 12 year off-take agreement.","Paul Patterson","That's 12 years, okay. And then just speaking, given the credit quality of Google and stuff, just to make sure I understand this, that's a better rate of return that you're getting. You guys perceived -- you guys expect to get a better return associated with that project than what you're getting in a regulated business. Do I understand you guys right in that?","Gale Klappa","You understand this absolutely correctly. And the experience that we've had so far with the other infrastructure investments that are operational experienced in 2019 is proving that out.","Paul Patterson","Okay, awesome. Thanks so much. ","Gale Klappa","You're welcome. Thanks for the call. All right. Well, folks, that concludes our long conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any other questions, we're always available. Please contact Beth Straka at 414-221-4639. Take care everybody.","Operator","Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference calls.

Thank you for waiting and welcome to Wisconsin Energy\u2019s Conference Call to review 2012 Second Quarter Results. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language.

A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale Klappa \u2013 Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us as we review the company\u2019s 2012 second quarter results. Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of WE Generation; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Pat Keyes, Treasurer; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer.","You may have seen the announcement on Monday afternoon that Rick has decided to retire early next year. Rick and I have known each other for nearly three decades. He is one of the most knowledgeable and effective leaders in our industry and he has made countless contributions to our progress here at Wisconsin Energy. We wish Rick and his wife Joyce all the very best as they begin the transition to retired life on the Gulf Coast.","Rick Kuester \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Thanks Gale. I appreciate it.","Gale Klappa \u2013 Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Rick. Well, first things first though, Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.51 a share for the second quarter of 2012. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $0.41 a share for the second quarter of 2011.","Weather, of course, continued to be the big story in the second quarter following the warmest winter in the 122 years here, we experienced an old-fashioned Midwestern heat wave in June with seven days reaching 90 degrees or higher across the region. It was hot town summer in the city, the third warmest June in the past 80 years. And I am pleased to report that our generating fleet performed well. We were able to meet the energy needs of our customers, thanks to the $3 billion we invested over the past decade in new efficient generating units through our Power the Future plan.","Turning now to the economy, Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate at 7% in June remains well below the national average. Energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers excluding the iron ore mines rose by 0.6% in the second quarter. Sectors showing strength in the quarter included chemicals, metal fabrication and heavy equipment manufacturing.","We also continued to see an up-tick in new customer connections. New services installed for electric customers were up 15% as compared to the first six months of last year. And connections of new natural gas customers rose by nearly 19% compared with the same period a year ago.","On the construction front, we have two major projects underway. The 50 megawatt biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin and the air quality control upgrade at the original Oak Creek units. We are making solid progress on our biomass fuel generating plant at the site of the Domtar Paper Mill in Rothschild in Northern Wisconsin. As of the end of July construction is approximately 39% complete. We are currently on schedule and on budget to meet a completion date by the end of 2013. The main boiler at Rothschild is now being erected, the cooling tower is complete and the circulating of water pump house is under construction. The main condensers, the aerator and combustion fans have been set in place and equipment is being installed in the switch yard and the fuel storage building.","As I have noted before the biomass plant will help us to diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. Being able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will produce electricity for the grid and steam for the operating paper mill will clearly enhance the economics of the project. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Of course the biomass project and Glacier Hills Wind Park that we completed late last year, our key components that will help us meet Wisconsin's renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity delivered from renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. This standard sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using an historical baseline.","Using that baseline approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in the year 2015. When we complete the biomass project we will be well-positioned to meet the 2015 standard. Also, we recently signed agreements for additional renewable energy credits which should allow us to be in compliance through the year 2018. And because of favorable market conditions, we expect to purchase more renewable credits further extending the timeframe that we expect to be in compliance.","Turning now to our Oak Creek site, we're nearing the finish line on the air quality control upgrade for the older coal-fired units. The four older units that operate have been among the most efficient base load units in the Midwest. Though the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million, including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction facilities, I would remind you that this is the second largest construction project in our Company's history. The air quality control equipment for units 5 and 6 at Oak Creek went into commercial service in March and is operating well meeting all emission standards.","We've now completed the physical tie in of the units 7 and 8 equipment and testing is well underway. We expect to achieve commercial operation of the new controls for units 7 and 8 during August and that will close out this $900 million project on time and we believe better than budget.","Turning now to other items of interest; last quarter, we discussed the impact we were seeing from conditions in the coal and natural gas markets. Natural gas prices have continued at historically low levels during the second quarter influencing the dispatch order and locational marginal pricing in the Midwest power market. Over the years, of course, the key to serving customers at competitive prices has been fuel diversity. And fuel diversity was a core principle of our Power the Future plan. You may remember that our plan called for the addition of 2,200 megawatts of new efficient capacity, capacity that is almost equally balanced between natural gas and coal.","And now with our efficient new capacity in place and natural gas prices at low levels, our natural gas burn is expected to about double from 24 billion cubic feet last year to 50 billion cubic feet in 2012. In fact, our natural gas units at Port Washington operated at a 59% capacity factor in the first half of this year. This compares with a 20% capacity factor during the same period in 2011. Our Port Washington units are essentially being dispatched now as baseload units. And as our natural gas burn has gone up, our coal burn is naturally gone down. We are projecting to burn approximately 9 million tons of coal this year versus 10.7 million tons in 2011. We will achieve this reduction by maximizing the use of storage, working with our coal suppliers to amend existing contracts and carrying out small planned burns.","We are also hard it work on a new initiative, a new initiative that would allow us to blend western and eastern coals at our new Oak Creek expansion units. As you may recall, the new units are currently permitted to burn eastern bituminous coal. However, moving to a blend with Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal could substantially lower fuel cost for our customers.","We have filed for a revised air permit and we expect to receive approval by year-end. Our plan calls for us to begin testing the blended coal burns that our Oak Creek expansion units during 2013. Overall, our diverse fleet and our long-term power purchase agreement for nuclear energy position us well as the power markets continue to evolve.","Now, I\u2019ll briefly review where we stand on the regulatory fronts in Wisconsin and Michigan. As you may recall, base rates for our electric customers in Wisconsin are frozen for 2012. We proposed and the Wisconsin Commission accepted a creative approach to delay a base rate increase as the economy here continues to improve.","Looking forward, the 2013 and 2014, we filed a rate request with the Wisconsin commission seeking an increase for our electric and steam customers and a decrease for our natural gas customers for 2013. On the electric side of our business, just to refresh the memory, the base rate adjustments were seeking in the next two years are driven by approximately $1.6 billion of new capital investment. These are investments of the commission previously approved to strength the reliability and with environmental requirements and to comply with Wisconsin\u2019s renewable energy mandate.","Projects previously approved by the commission include the air quality control system for the older units at Oak Creek, at Glacier Hills Wind Park, the biomass facility and the Oak Creek expansion units. Our proposal includes using a federal energy grants that we expect to receive for our biomass facility. After applying this cash grant, the result would be a net customer bill impact of 3.6% in both 2013 and 2014.","Our filing also includes an estimate the fuel cost for 2013. Our fuel cost projections will be updated and finalized as for our normal procedure later this year. On the natural gas front, we proposed a decrease in base rates for customers of our two natural gas distribution utilities in 2013. We are seeking a 2.3% decrease for Wisconsin gas customers and a two-tenths of 1% decrease for Wisconsin Electric gas customers.","For 2014, we are also proposing the base rates for our natural gas customers remain flat. For our steam utility, we filed for an increase in 2013 of approximately 6% for our downtown Milwaukee customers and approximately 7% for our Milwaukee County customers. In 2014, our proposal calls for an increase in steam rates of 6% for both customer groups.","At a pre-hearing conference on May 21, the staff of the Wisconsin Commission stated that it does not intend to pursue capital structure or return on equity as issues in this proceeding. Recently, the staff completed its field audit and technical and public hearings have been scheduled for the fall. We expect to receive rate orders by the end of 2012. We\u2019ve asked with the new electric and steam rates go into effect at the start of 2013 and 2014 and the new gas rates be effective the start of 2013.","Turning now to our Michigan rate case, the Michigan Commission issued a final order to increase retail of electric rates by $9.2 million annually effective on June 27 of this year. The new electric rates of the Michigan reflect the substantial investments we\u2019ve made in reliability, renewable energy, and environmental upgrades.","Switching gears now, you will recall that our board has approved a share repurchase plan scheduled to run through the end of 2013. A plan authorizes us to buyback up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. No purchases were made in the first or second quarter of this year. Previously, we repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $100 million that equates to an average purchase price of $30.79 per share. And as we previously announced, our Board has adopted a dividend policy that targets a 60% payout ratio in the year 2014. This policy should support double-digit growth in our dividend in both 2013 and 2014 as we move toward a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector.","Finally, I\u2019d like to discuss the investment opportunities that we see going forward in our core business. As we\u2019ve mentioned our capital budget calls for spending $3.5 billion over the five year period 2012 through 2016. And with this five year budget the nature of our capital investments are shifting away from high profile projects such as our power the future units, renewable generation and large air quality controls. Instead our capital plan is comprised now of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure, the building blocks of our delivery business pipes, polls, wires, transformers, and substation components.","The primary risks associated with these projects developmental, legal, regulatory, construction are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and the scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the mega projects we\u2019ve just completed. Our focus on renewing our distribution facilities is essential for maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest.","As you know, we\u2019ve also been reviewing additional investments that meet our return criteria and our risk profile. And I\u2019m pleased to announce that on July 27, just last week we signed an agreement with NextEra Energy Resources to buy the Montfort Wind Energy Center, an existing 30 megawatt wind farm located in Ohio County, Wisconsin. The purchase price is $27 million. We currently have a power purchase agreement for 85% of the output from the site. The remaining 15% is under our power purchase agreement with another Wisconsin utility. We believe this acquisition will deliver positive economic benefits for our customers and our shareholders. After approval the wind farm would be added to our retail rate base. This acquisition of course is subject to FERC and Wisconsin Commission approval and we're targeting a financial close by the end of 2012. We will be retaining NextEra to operate the site under an operations and maintenance agreement.","Also as you may recall the future of the Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is under review now because of expected changes in National Ambient Air Quality Standards by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. So, we've been working to identify a life extension option for the Presque Isle plant that is economically beneficial for our customers. We\u2019re studying the possibility as we\u2019ve reported to you of a joint venture with Wolverine Power Cooperative for environmental upgrades to the Presque Isle units and potential joint ownership of the plant. Wolverine under-accounts that would pay for the environmental upgrades and receive an ownership interest in the facility. The parties are discussing the terms and we've initiated now the second phase of engineering to assess a more detailed scope of work for the air quality controls. If the joint venture moves forward, we would not expect to have any reduction in our rate base. As always, we\u2019ll keep you posted on this potential transaction as it evolves.","And in closing I\u2019d like to mention that with the recall elections in Wisconsin now completes, we have continuity in state government and a renewed focus on improving the business climate across the state and progress is being made. In a recent survey reported by Chief Executive Magazine, Wisconsin jumped four more spots to 20th best state in the nation in which to do business. One spot better than Alabama and are right behind South Dakota. Overall, Wisconsin has climbed 23 places in the survey since 2008.","And now with more details on our second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2012 here is Rick.","Rick Kuester \u2013 Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier our 2012 second quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.51 a share as compared to $0.41 a share in 2011. The results were better than planned because of hotter than normal weather in June, lower operation and maintenance costs and positive impact of the company's share repurchase program.","Taking a closer look at the numbers, I will focus on earnings drivers at the operating income level by business segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows for the first six months of the year. Our consolidated operating income in the second quarter of 2012 was $223 million as compared to $174 million in the last year\u2019s second quarter, an increase of $49 million.","Starting with utility energy segment, you will see that operating income totaled $134 million, an increase of $46 million versus 2011. A significant factor in the quarter was the hot weather. We estimate that our electric and gas margins increased by $20 million as compared to last year and $17.3 million as compared to normal weather.","In addition to the impact of weather, our collections on fuel improved by $11 million and our O&M costs were reduced by $30 million when compared to 2011. These positive factors were offset by a $10 million increase in depreciation expense at the utility level. The reduction in O&M cost is directly related to the one year amortization holiday of certain regulatory assets.","As previously mentioned, last year we\u2019ve reached an agreement with the Wisconsin Commission that allowed us to freeze base electric rates in 2012. One of the provisions in the agreement was the ability to stop the amortization of certain regulatory asset. This action will reduce O&M by $148 million during 2012, which flows evenly through the year. This agreement was designed to help our customers avoid 2012 price increases and allow shareholders to earn return on the capital projects that Gale discussed earlier.","The increase in depreciation expense over last year is related to the first units of the air quality control system at our older Oak Creek plant, which went into service earlier this year, and to the Glacier Hills Wind Park, which went into service in late 2011. Operating income in the non-utility energy segment, which consists primarily of the Power the Future units, was up by $2 million. We finalized the depreciable lives of the new Oak Creek units, which had a slight positive impact on earnings. Taking the changes for these two segments together, along with corporate charges and other miscellaneous items, you\u2019ll arrive at the $49 million increase in operating income for the second quarter of 2012.","During the second quarter of 2012 earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company increased just slightly over 2011. Our other income was reduced by $6 million because of lower AFUDC, now that the air quality control project for units 5 and 6 at Oak Creek is complete.","Net interest expense increased by $5 million primarily because of lower capitalized interest associated with lower construction work in progress. Consolidated income tax rose by approximately $18 million because of higher pre-tax earnings and higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $119 million of net income from continuing operations with the second quarter of 2012 or earnings of $0.51 per share.","During the first six months of 2012, our adjusted operating cash flows totaled $636 million, which is a $25 million increase from the same period in 2011. Our adjusted operating cash flows include the impact of changes in restricted cash. The largest favorable factor relates to our benefit plans. In 2011, we contributed $122 million to our plans in the first six months of the year. No such contributions were made during the first half of this year. On the negative side, we saw a $74 million reduction in non-cash charges because of the regulatory amortization holiday in 2012.","Our total capital expenditures decreased by approximately $33 million in the first six months of 2012 as compared to 2011. We saw lower expenditures as projects were completed. We also paid $138 million in common dividends in the first six months of 2012, which was $17 million greater than the same period last year. Dividends in the first six months equate to an annual dividend of $1.20 per share, which is a 15% increase over the prior year\u2019s annual dividend of $1.04 per share.","Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 53.1% as of June 30, 2012. Our adjusted calculations treat half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","As shown in the earnings package on our website, our first half 2012 retail sales of electricity increased by 0.8% as compared to the first half of 2011. Our weather normalized sales were down by 0.6%. Excluding the mines normalized sales decreased by 0.3%. As you recall we have two customers that began utilizing their own self generation in 2012.","Adjusting for these customers and the mines on a normalized basis, we saw our retail sales grow by 0.2% during the first half of 2012 as compared to 2011. Overall, these results are in line with our 2012 sales forecast. As we look at our natural gas sales with the significantly warmer than normal winter, we saw our retail sales decline in the first half the year by almost 24% as compared to 2011. However, on a weather normalized basis, our natural gas sales are in line with our forecast. As a result of the warmer weather, we will increase our earnings guidance for the year. We expect our earnings for 2012 to be in the range of $2.28 to $2.32 per share.","Before I turn things back over to Gale, I would like to provide quarterly guidance. Factoring in the hot weather in July, we estimate that third quarter earnings will be in the range $0.56 to $0.59 per share. Recall that last year\u2019s third quarter was hot which improved earnings by ($0.10) per share versus normal weather.","With that, I\u2019ll turn the things back over to Gale.","Gale Klappa \u2013 Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer","","Rick, thank you very much. Overall, we are on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with (indiscernible). Please state your question.","Gale Klappa","Hi, Kit. How are you?","Unidentified Analyst","Good. Good afternoon, Gale. And I just have to say that Rick you\u2019ve got to be kidding me, I mean, you are too young to retire. Well, it is what it is, right. So, as long as you are still here, I just want to be clear as I heard you, the increase in guidance, did you say that\u2019s purely related to weather, and so wouldn\u2019t have any other implications about otherwise running ahead of plan on fundamentals etcetera?","Rick Kuester","No, it\u2019s really a weather driven change, Kit.","Unidentified Analyst","Alright, that is good. And maybe can you review with us a little bit, the details of sales growth say by customer class what you are seeing out there residential, commercial, industrial?","Rick Kuester","Okay. I\u2019ll let Steve Dickson, our Controller walk through that for you.","Steve Dickson","Yes.","Gale Klappa","While Steve is turning to the right page, I can give you a couple of fun facts. May and June which were warm months here, our residential customers used more electricity in May and June than any other May and June in history. The industrial side really very much as Rick said, very much unfolding like our projections indicated they would, pretty flat overall on the industrial demand side but some pockets of strength. Steve?","Steve Dickson","Yeah, I think, Gale you nailed that, on the earnings package on page 10, we show six months electric sales, and again, residential is up 1.7% it was weather. When you normalize the weather, we think it\u2019s right on track. And as we\u2019ve said in the script, we are down a little bit in large commercial, but it\u2019s because of an expected outage there are largest customers and two customers switching. So, things are right on track.","Gale Klappa","All of which were in the original plan?","Unidentified Analyst","Okay, very good. Thanks a lot.","Gale Klappa","Thank you, Kit. Hang in there.","Operator","So, our next question comes from line of Jim Von Riesemann with UBS.","Gale Klappa","Hi, Jim.","Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Hi, everyone.","Gale Klappa","How are you doing today, Jim?","Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","I\u2019m doing well. How the packers going to do this year?","Gale Klappa","Packers are just rated number one. I hope the pre-season ratings hold up.","Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Okay, we\u2019ll talk about in the January.","Gale Klappa","Yeah.","Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Rick, congratulations on your retirement pack, congratulations or good luck in your new role, but Gale this question is for you?","Gale Klappa","This buds for you.","Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Every quarter we talk about your dividend, dividend growth, previously and today the discussion is centered on this double-digit dividend growth and the mathematical 10% to get you to this 60% targeted payout by 2014. So, the question is this, as you look into your crystal ball, what factors would get you to amend that thinking say, excuse me, raise the target to a higher level, perhaps 65% or a 70% payout? And the second part of that question is how has your thinking been formed with respect to the buybacks, especially with the shares trading at better than two times book versus reallocating that money more towards dividend growth?","Gale Klappa","Okay, good questions Jim. I appreciate it. On the first thing related to our dividend pay-out ratio targets, we\u2019ve mentioned we are targeting to move to a 60% payout ratio by 2014. That of course would support based on our projections double-digit earnings or a double-digit dividend growth for 2013 and 2014.","And my direct answer to your question is one step at a time. When we get to 2014 we have a stated policy of having a competitive dividend payout ratio and we'll look around, come 2014 and see where we are against industry norms and see what it takes to maintain a competitive payout ratio. We\u2019ll also look at the fundamental underlying strengths of the company. We'll look at our cash flows. We'll look at all the standard things that you would normally expect us to look at, but it will be in the context of what does it take to maintain a competitive payout ratio against other regulated companies in our sector.","Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Okay","Gale Klappa","And then on the share buyback the concept remains very much intact that we announced. We basically completed a third of the buyback already and as I mentioned at a very, very attractive repurchase price of $30.79 a share I mentioned in the script we did not repurchase any shares in Q1 or Q2. And as we moved forward we can be very patient and our criteria is very simple, we will look at what is the best after-tax return that we can deliver for our shareholders from our free cash flow. The effects of an additional investment for example like the Montfort Wind Energy Center that we mentioned, well that's what we do. At the end of the day our commitment is not to hoard cash, but to return value to shareholders and obviously our preference would be to do so with additional investment projects that meet our return criteria and our risk profile. But if we don't find those additional projects, then again we'll use that cash in a way that most benefits our shareholders from an after tax standpoint.","Jim Von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","Got it. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","Terrific. Thank you, Jim.","Operator","You next question comes from the line Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Gale Klappa","Hi Paul.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Good morning \u2013 good afternoon sorry. I wanted to ask you about the field audit. Do you hear me?","Gale Klappa","Yes we can hear you.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","I\u2019m sorry. The field audit, you mentioned that the staff had recently...?","Gale Klappa","I\u2019m sorry that\u2019s field audit.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Right.","Gale Klappa","In every rate case, because we project expenses two years going forward. If you recall, Wisconsin has a two year forward-looking test year. So, what we do when we file a normal rate case during our normal cycle is we file our projected O&M and capital expenses in this case for 2013 and 2014 and then the staff does what we call a field audit. They come, look at all of our projections. They look at our past spending. They do trends, and they recommend how much O&M should be included in our future rates.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And what did they say?","Gale Klappa","What did they say? Well, I think, I'm not sure they're completely through with their recommendations yet.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. I though you said they have been completed recently.","Gale Klappa","The physical field work has been done and now they are cranking.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. I got you. Okay, I'm sorry. I misunderstood you.","Gale Klappa","No problem.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And then on the weather normalized numbers, I apologize but I missed them. I\u2019ve got the regular numbers here, I didn\u2019t \u2013 I wasn\u2019t able to locate the weather adjusted ones for residential and small commercial, what were they?","Gale Klappa","Steve, you\u2019ve got those?","Steve Dickson","Yeah. We don\u2019t do it by customer class. As far as, are you talking about the impact on the margin or the growth between units?","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","I'm talking about the kilowatt hour sales for the quarter that you had, I mean, outside this large industrial \u2013 large commercial industrial just sort of get a flavor for how weather adjusted sales performed?","Steve Dickson","Compared to our original forecast, we\u2019re right on track.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. I\u2019m sorry, what was the original \u2013 I mean, what is the number, I\u2019m sorry?","Steve Dickson","I\u2019m sorry, what\u2019s the question again?","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","The question is on a kilowatt hour sales growth, Q2 2012 versus Q1 2012, taking out the impact obviously you had a very warm weather, what would the sales growth have been?","Steve Dickson","What we did as we projected a flat sales growth basically because there\u2019s a little growth in customers, but then we see conservation efforts going out there. And so we just basically had flat residential and a slight up-tick about 0.6% in the small commercial industrial.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Year-to-date, is that pretty much what you\u2019re\u2026?","Steve Dickson","Yeah, we\u2019re seeing the actual weather normalized results come in pretty close.","Rick Kuester","Paul our analyst \u2013 latest analyst book that we filed has on page seven basically our forecast for 2012 versus 2011 normalized.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, great. And then finally, you mentioned this after-tax return of cash or after-tax use of cash, the best return for your investors. Are you having \u2013 I mean, you mentioned that you want to have a competitive payout ratio, but I mean is there \u2013 do you guys have any thoughts with respect to what the impact of the fiscal cliff were, an abrupt change in tax \u2013 just any change in tax policy regarding dividends which we may see I guess, is that into any other thinking in terms of how you\u2019re going to be approaching it?","Gale Klappa","Well, I can say to you that the fiscal cliff is not in our thinking related to dividend policy, because we have to look at dividend policy on a long-term basis. So, I mean, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily take a very short-term kind of an event into account when we\u2019re trying to set dividend policy for multi-years. In terms of taxes, we would certainly take that into account. But in talking with our investors around the country and in Europe, many of them have given me the advice about don\u2019t worry about our tax rates, I mean just try to have a competitive dividend policy and a superior risk-adjusted total returns. So, unless there was there was to be a punitive dividend tax rate increase which I would hope that we would avoid as a nation. I don\u2019t think it would have \u2013 certainly we would look at it, but I don\u2019t think it would be a huge factor in our overall dividend policy and setting that policy going forward.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay, so I mean when you say punitive, are we talking about perhaps I mean as you know historically there has been a difference between dividends being taxed as opposed to capital gains, but given your discussions if I understand you correctly, given your discussions in how you guys are sort of looking at it and obviously I guess nothing\u2019s firm, but it would be that \u2013 your inclination would be that outside of some major I guess discrepancy between capital gains and dividend taxes that you wouldn't really plan on that having an impact, is the that right?","Gale Klappa","That is correct. But I will say this, I am very hopeful and as you know our industry and others have a very I think an hope effective program underway to inform Congress and the (staffs) in Congress about how important it is not to favor one type of investment over another in terms of either capital gains or dividends. And I did notice that the Democratic proposal that came through just a couple of weeks ago, while it raised slightly taxes on dividends for upper income individuals it also maintained the link between capital gains, tax rates and dividend tax rates. I think, we-re making and hope we\u2019re making some economic sense to Congress that you really don\u2019t want tax policy to skew investment decisions. And so I\u2019m very hopeful that regardless of what the final rate ends up being next year that there will be a linkage.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Well, you\u2019re economically informing Congress, this is something I wish you had laid down, no, but I \u2013 thank you very much for your comments. I appreciate it.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re more than welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey guys, Rick, congratulations on your retirement announcement. We\u2019ll obviously miss working with you. You\u2019re one of the best in this business. Couple of just financing and capital structure questions, first of all, what are your plans to get financing for the year both in terms of raw totals and where meaning at the holding company at the operating companies, etcetera. And second, cash taxes, can you talk a little bit about expectations for the difference between GAAP and cash taxes for the next few years?","Gale Klappa","In terms of the \u2013 Michael, in terms of the financing plans for the remainder of the year, we\u2019ll let Pat speak to that, but we really only have one bond offering for the second half of the year. Pat?","Pat Keyes","Right, Michael I mean our debt as it looks at the end of last year, it was very comfortable how it looked at the end of Q2. As Gale mentioned, we\u2019ve got one bond offering planned for roughly $250 million at Wisconsin Electric that will happen in latter half of the year. And I think, the last part of your question was, are we looking at other debt retirements like at the holding company. The answer is yes, we continue to look \u2013 evaluate options. However, there is nothing in this year\u2019s plan that says we\u2019re going to take any of that debt out.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And cash taxes versus GAAP taxes?","Gale Klappa","Well, in terms of our cash taxes, we\u2019re benefiting certainly from accelerated depreciation. And so our GAAP taxes, as we mentioned, our effective tax rate will probably be between 35.5% this year, but the cash taxes will be absolutely minimal because of the impact of the Obama accelerated depreciation.","Rick Kuester","And of course that's a timing issue.","Gale Klappa","Very much a timing issue.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it, okay. And last thing just curious when you think about your rates on a cents per KWH basis, given what you\u2019ve requested in the rate case how would your rates look relative to, what you say, about some of your Wisconsin peers?","Gale Klappa","Well, as you know, we proposed and received an order allowing us to freeze our base rates for 2012.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Right.","Gale Klappa","The other Wisconsin utilities actually received rate increases effective January 1, 2012. Virtually, every Wisconsin utility is in for a rate case that will be decided between now and the end of the year. So, my sense is that our relative positioning in Wisconsin will be unchanged. In fact, maybe a hair better, because some of the other Wisconsin utilities are seeking higher base rate increases than we are, but I am glad you asked that question, Michael, because there is an important underlying trend going on here that I think will be very evident over the course of the next three, four, five years, particularly in the greater Midwest and the nation as a whole.","We have invested, as you know, well actually since 2003 $7.8 billion in infrastructure upgrades. Much of that capital not only has gone to efficient new generation, but it\u2019s gone to modern air quality controls. So, our customers are now paying in their current rates for the air quality controls and the improvement in the environment that the EPA is actually trying to mandate now nationwide. So, as the EPA rules continue to be enforced, by 2015 or 2016 as other companies either have to invest significant capital and probably capital per unit of capacity at a higher cost than ours or retire capacity, their costs are going to go up and up at a much faster rate than ours. So, I believe if you think about Wayne Gretzky and his comment was always I want to know where the puck is going, instead of where the puck is today. Where the puck is going is that we will look increasingly competitive over the course of the next five years and we are very pleased about that.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Last question O&M flexibility, when you look out at your O&M budget for the next 12 to 24 months, you guys have been among the best in the industry at managing O&M costs over the last few years. Just curious about your ability to continue implementing O&M cost cutting or cost management going forward?","Gale Klappa","Well, I am very positive on our ability to continue to control our O&M cost. Actually, the two biggest drivers right now of our cost pressure really are putting into rates the $1.6 billion of capital investment for the project that I mentioned during the early part of the conference call. And so our single biggest pressure really is recovering the cost of that capital that we have invested for our customers. We are also seeing higher healthcare costs as every company is seeing, but 7% to 10% inflation on healthcare costs is not atypical for us. Those two items obviously are significant, but overall our managers are very focused on productivity. We are a far more productive company than we were eight or nine years ago and I think we can and will continue to be.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, thank you guys. Much appreciated, and Rick once again congratulations.","Rick Kuester","Thanks a lot Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","Gale Klappa","Rock and roll Jay, how are you?","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","Very well, Gale, and Rick congratulations.","Rick Kuester","Thanks Jay.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Hey, Gale. I was hoping you could put a little context around some of your prepared remarks regarding new service connections, you\u2019ve put them in somewhat stark numbers versus year ago new service connections, but I thought maybe you could help us understand what they mean versus sort of current customer count, so we might sort of drive to what that\u2019s exactly doing on customer account and hence it\u2019s run through sales?","Gale Klappa","Now, I\u2019d be happy to. And let me back up and maybe give you in a little more context. Before the recession hit in late 2008 and 2009, we were historically seeing here maybe 1% somewhere between 0.75% and 1.25% customer growth. During the recession that growth slowed to a crawl. We never went negative on customer growth as some utilities did, but obviously that growth slowed to a crawl.","Now, we\u2019re beginning to see a slight acceleration, and so the numbers I gave you the percentage increases, we\u2019re really seeing about a 0.3% to 0.35% increase in customer growth. Again, compared to normal, that\u2019s fairly anemic. But compared to where we were during the years of the recession, it\u2019s a nice rebound. And the other thing I think that\u2019s important here is that Wisconsin has really come through the recession in better shape than many states.","Our unemployment rate here never got anywhere near double digits. As I mentioned in the earlier part of the call, the current unemployment rate is around 6.8% to 7% depending upon which month in the second quarter you look at. And we\u2019re seeing some commercial growth beginning again, particularly in the Milwaukee region, which I\u2019m encouraged about. We\u2019re seeing new shopping centers, there is a new proposal for a major downtown skyscraper, that is just being vetted here in Milwaukee County. So, underlying we\u2019re starting to see a nascent pickup in terms of customer growth and economic activity, does that help, Jay?","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","That helps a lot. Thanks Gale. And maybe Rick, then on the revised guidance, I just sort of wanted to maybe really understand what\u2019s in the number. So, I guess, by the old guidance you\u2019re raising by $0.03 to $0.04 and citing that is weather. If I look at the first six months of 2012, we\u2019re down about $0.08. But I think that\u2019s versus a year ago, so maybe put that in context versus normal, so we can sort of understand what you\u2019re assuming in the second half of the year for weather?","Rick Kuester","We\u2019re assuming normal weather in the second half of the year except for \u2013 have factored in a warm July. So, from a weather standpoint, normal weather from August on.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Normal weather from August on, okay. Perfect.","Gale Klappa","As Rick said, I mean, it's clearly been a very warm July and we have a fairly good sense that we will have a strong July earnings growth. So, we decided to factor it in.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","No. That\u2019s perfect. And then last one, on the wind farm acquisition, Gale, are there opportunities like that, maybe just sort of walk through how that came together and what the sort of magic sauce is that makes that work from both a customer and investor standpoint. And then are there other opportunities in the state to do something similar?","Gale Klappa","Well, let\u2019s see Rick and I can both answer that, Rick was our lead negotiator with NextEra on the purchase of the Montfort Wind Energy Center. I think essentially for us and looking at that acquisition from our standpoint. We had a long-term power purchase agreement I think it expires in 2026, Rick\u2026","Rick Kuester","That\u2019s correct.","Gale Klappa","With NextEra taking 85% of the output from that wind farm, the other 15% is already covered under PPA with another Wisconsin utility. And our view was at the right price we could approach the Wisconsin Commission seeking approval to in essence purchase the site, purchase the wind farm, put the $27 million in rate base. And the key was could we show definitively a customer benefit. At $27 million in rate base compared to a power purchase agreement, we can definitely show our customer benefit. Rick?","Rick Kuester","We\u2019ve been taking power out of that wind farm for about 10 years Jay and PTCs basically run out and as we looked at it in our cost of capital and the benefits to customers not only between now and 2026 but beyond 2026, because we will continue to have renewable Rec needs just we were able to get to an agreement with NextEra that made sense for both parties, makes sense for customers, make sense for our shareholders too.","Gale Klappa","As far as any other opportunities, we do have one other major power purchase agreement and that\u2019s energy coming from a combined cycle plant a natural gas, combined cycle plant called Whitewater. That one is a little bit more difficult in terms of thinking about a purchase and inserting that into rate base, more difficult simply because of the ownership structure a private equity firm owns a significant interest I think a Japanese utility owns another interest. There are some complexities related to the debt financing on that particular plant, so we don't see a near-term opportunity there, I think Rick and I both feel like long-term we are probably the natural owner of the Whitewater plant, but I would see that as long-term. In the course of the other potential opportunity, which we will know a lot more about in 2013 is whether or not there will be a piece of legislation that would authorize the privatization of power plants owned by the state of Wisconsin. There is obviously an election in November. The outcome of that election in terms of who and which party controls the assembly and the state Senate will obviously have an impact on whether that legislation will proceed, but we think that\u2019s a 2013 issue and a 2013 potential in terms of legislation.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","That\u2019s great. Thanks for the insight, Gale.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re more than welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar.","Andy Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","","Good afternoon.","Gale Klappa","Hi Andy, how are you?","Andy Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","Good. Gale, you just spoke to the political environment that is kind of settling down, you spoke to the state divestitures, could you speak to any change in renewable mandates you see going forward?","Gale Klappa","I\u2019ll be happy to give you my view. And I think the short answer is we really don\u2019t see any changes in the renewable mandates going forward. There is no momentum and no one has proposed really to rollback the standards. There is also, I don\u2019t believe any momentum to increase the standards. So, our sense is that for a number of years to come, the renewable mandate will stay in place as is. Recall one thing though, the mandate sets this baseline and we need to get statewide to a 10% renewable sources by 2015 10% of retail sales, but that 10% threshold stays in place for each year going forward after 2015. So, if sales grow, if customer demand grows, then there is also growth in the component that would have to come from renewables.","Rick Kuester","And also the \u2013 we are meeting that by a combination of investments, which is in wind farms like Glacier Hills, and also short-term purchases of typically five years or so which roll off. So, in addition to sales growth, we\u2019ll have some short-term purchases rollout over the next few years?","Gale Klappa","It\u2019s very good point, Rick.","Andy Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","That helps tremendously, and one quick question regarding month or own, you expect that be in rate base?","Gale Klappa","Well, we are asking the commission for approval during the second half of 2012. We would hope to close the transaction right at the end of 2012, and if that\u2019s the case it would be in rate base for 2013.","Andy Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","Great, thanks so very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levy with Avon Capital Advisors.","Gale Klappa","Andy, how are you today?","Andy Levy \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Good, thank you. Actually, I\u2019m all said. Rick, good luck as only known you two plus decades, but enjoying that?","Gale Klappa","You can be that\u2026","Andy Levy \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Yeah, unfortunately, we are all getting up there. I\u2019ll get up there, but enjoy Rick.","Rick Kuester","Thanks.","Gale Klappa","Andy, I don\u2019t know if you heard Rick, but you said it\u2019s not the age of the miles.","Andy Levy \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Yes, yes.","Gale Klappa","Take care, Andy.","Andy Levy \u2013 Avon Capital Advisors","Yeah, take care.","Operator","At this time, there are no further questions.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of management remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Charlene. Thank you all for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter of the year. Now before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, who is our Controller; and finally Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Now let's look at our second quarter 2016 results, the end of the second quarter marked the first anniversary of our Integrys acquisition, which closed on June 29 last year. Consistent with the first quarter, we are now reporting results of the combined company. We reported second quarter earnings of $0.57 per share that compares with adjusted earnings of $0.58 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Our adjusted earnings, in both 2015 and 2016, include interest on the debt issued to purchase Integrys as well as the shares we issued in the transaction.","Scott will review the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment. The results of our integration efforts have exceeded our expectations. As I mentioned last quarter, our focus on cost controls and other tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. We submitted our standard annual electric fuel filings in Wisconsin on July 1, asking for a modest reduction at We Energies and a slight increase at Wisconsin Public Service. The only active rate case is that our Minnesota gas utility where interim rates are in place.","Our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% off a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Key to delivering this growth is the execution of our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation. Now, let me give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. We believe that approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits will be generated from the bonus depreciation extension, about two thirds of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings this year, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017, as well as in following years.","As you may recall from the first quarter call, we've advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million. In addition, we've made progress in the later years of our five-year forecast. We now expect to extend our electric System Modernization and Reliability Project at Wisconsin Public Service. This should represent another $100 million of capital investment in the 2019 and 2020 period. I would add that this is a popular program with customers at Wisconsin Public Service who are seeing significant benefits in the form of greatly reduced outages during storms. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current five-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our five-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI Finance conference.","Turning now to our operations in Illinois, we're moving forward on the Peoples' gas system modernization program formerly known as AMRP. This is one of the largest natural gas system infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas pipelines. Over the past year, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 19% complete, and we continue to make good progress. We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission late last year that describes our top priorities in the three-year period from 2016 to 2018. The plan calls for removing and replacing more than 250 miles of aging cast-iron pipes in neighborhoods most at risk. This will require investing a projected $250 million to $280 million a year.","After hearing stakeholder recommendations on issues such as the program's emphasis on safety and reliability, scope, schedule, cost forecast and controls and plans for measuring and monitoring progress, the ICC staff conducted a policy session in April summarizing the six workshops and then provided a comprehensive report to the commission on May 31. Last week, the ICC issued an order to begin a proceeding to evaluate the matters covered in the ICC staff report. The first step in the proceeding is expected to be completed within 30 days when we are required to provide the ICC with an updated plan for the gas system modernization program. We believe that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the first quarter of 2017. In the interim, our work on the gas infrastructure replacement program will continue.","Now, I would like to briefly update you on two matters pending at the FERC. First at the end of June, an administrative law judge issued its recommended ROEs for the second pending complaint. The recommendation was for 9.7% base ROE and ATC could add a 50-basis-point adder for a total of 10.2% ROE. We have updated our reserve to reflect this.","The second item pending at FERC is related to the system support resource payments for the Presque Isle Power Plant. In this case, another administrative law judge issued a recommendation requiring an approximate $20 million reduction to the payments we received for the period of February 2014 through January 2015. We are currently evaluating the ALJ's recommendation. However, if the FERC adopts the ALJ decision, I do not expect that this will result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in income. A decision is not likely until next year.","Next, I want to give you a brief reminder on our dividend. On January 21, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.395 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is approximately at the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. And we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.","So, now for more details on our second quarter results, here's Scott.","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 second quarter GAAP earnings were $0.57 per share, compared with $0.35 per share in the second quarter of 2015. Second quarter results in 2016 include the impact of the Integrys companies. Excluding $0.23 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share decreased by $0.01 from $0.58 in the second quarter 2015 to $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. You may recall that we reported adjusted earnings per share of $0.59 in the second quarter last year.","For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 second quarter earnings on a consistent basis, the calculations of adjusted earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 now include all interest related to the acquisition financing and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. As a result, the comparable adjusted earnings per share value for 2015 is now $0.58 per share. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliations. First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense, and income taxes.","Referring to page 11 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $332.1, million as compared to an adjusted $230.8 million in 2015, an increase of $101.3 million. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $214.7 million for 2016, an increase of $74.3 million from the adjusted second quarter of 2015. We realized a $51.5 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service and reported a $22.8 million increase driven in part by higher quarter-over-quarter electricity demand at Wisconsin Electric as temperatures in the early summer of 2016 were warmer than normal.","In the second quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment had $22.6 million of operating income and our other states segment added $2.3 million of operating income. We added these segments as part of our Integrys acquisition. Operating income in the We Power segment was up $900,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our corporate and other segment realized an operating loss of $1.6 million this quarter, as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.8 million in the second quarter of 2015 due primarily to lower labor costs. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at a $101.3 million increase from adjusted operating income.","Moving to other income, during the second quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $30.9 million, an increase of $16.6 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase on our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of Integrys acquisition. As Allen mentioned earlier, this was in part offset by an incremental reserve taken to reflect the most recent administrative law judge recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews.","Our other income net increased by $6.3 million largely related to higher AFUDC to the inclusion of AFUDC from the Integrys companies.","Our net interest expense increased $38.3 million driven by $33.7 million of interest expense from the Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $6 million quarter-over-quarter increase in interest expense on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition. Earnings from the Integrys companies were a primary driver of the $38.3 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. We anticipate that our annual effective tax rate for 2016 will be between 37.5% to 38.5%. Combining all these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $133.8 million or $0.58per share for the second quarter of 2015, compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.","Now, looking to our cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $507.6 million during the first six months of 2016. This increase was driven by $466.6 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys during the first half of 2016. The remaining increase was driven in part by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. You may recall that we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015 and we did not make a contribution in 2016. This increase was partially offset by changes in working capital.","While I am on the subject of pensions, with the current interest rate environment, the potential exists for an approximate 100-basis-point reduction in our discount rate to about 3.5%. On a enterprise-wide basis, we estimate that this would add approximately $35 million to pension expense in 2017. This also could impact the level of pension contributions that would be made next year. We currently are factoring this into our 2017 plan.","Our capital expenditures, totaled $618.7 million during the first six months of 2017 (sic) [2016] (14:53). A $250.7 million increase, compared to the same period in 2015. The largest increase was driven primarily by capital investments, at the Integrys companies. Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 50.1% at the end of June. Our calculation treats half the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations.","We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We also paid $312.4 million in common dividends during the six months ended June 30, 2016, an increase of a $121.9 million over the same period last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2015.","We also see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our Wisconsin utilities were serving nearly 9,000 more electric customers, and nearly 14,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota are now serving nearly 15,000 more customers in the past year.","For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I'll discuss next reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and year-to-date results factor all the effects of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were up 1% compared to the second quarter of 2015. Actual second quarter deliveries increased 3%.","Looking now at the individual customer segments, weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 2.8%, while actual residential deliveries rose 7.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 0.7%, actual deliveries increased 2.2%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2016 increased 0.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries increased 0.3%. We continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy, including plastics, food processing and chemical processing. Year-to-date normalized retail deliveries, excluding the iron ore mines increased 0.4%.","Now, an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 3.9% compared to the same period in 2015 due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, year-to-date retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation were up 2.8%. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations.","Turning now to our earnings forecast. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. We are off to a strong start. We still have six months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share.","Finally, let's look at the third quarter guidance. As I mentioned last quarter, natural gas distribution is now a larger portion of our business thus we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first quarter and fourth quarter due to higher \u2013 to gas heating margins, and relatively lower earnings per share in the second quarter and third quarter when compared to past years. Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and warmer than normal July weather, we expect our third quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.55 to $0.59. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any potential acquisition-related cost that may arise. Again, the third quarter earnings guidance is $0.55 per share to $0.59 per share.","With that, I'll turn things back to Allen.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you, Scott. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of our call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. And now we'd like to take your questions. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. Good afternoon.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I apologize, I hopped on just a minute or two late. You guys, I was told, did increase your capital expenditure budget in the back half of the five-year plan. Can you go back and talk about how much of rate base growth was reduced by the impact of bonus depreciation? How much of that you had offset already prior to this update? And then how much incrementally you've found in customer-friendly projects that further mitigate that impact?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","I'd be happy to, Greg. I think some review is good. And so the bonus depreciation extension, which was really a reach-back to 2015 as well as an extension out to, I guess, 2019, we think results in about $1 billion worth of cash tax benefits. So back on the February and the May calls we gave an update to everybody on where we stood versus offsetting that $1 billion. So as we got to the end of the May call, we had identified $500 million and those were primarily this year and next. So about $500 million between 2016 and 2017.","And so now what we've identified is another $100 million in addition to that $500 million. So the $100 million is in the years 2019 and 2020. It's about $50 million a year, Greg. And what this relates to is really the continuation of a four-year program that they've had at Wisconsin Public Service. The first phase involved distribution automation as well as undergrounding of electric distribution. The second phase will be strictly devoted, we expect to the undergrounding of electric distribution. So about $50 million in 2019, $50 million in 2020, and we also believe out in 2021 and 2022, there is yet another $50 million a year to do in those two years.","And this program, it's been very, very popular with customers and it was interesting, this summer, we've had quite a bit of storm activity in the Wisconsin Public Service territory, and for those that had their service, had these distribution lines undergrounded, they saw a much less in terms of outage times. So it's been a very popular program. I hope that helps, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","No, that helps tremendously. And is this a continuous review process, and as we get into the next quarter and we get to EEI that you're continuing to try to observe where you could put more capital to work that has further benefits for customers or is this the end of that review?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, it's really more of the former, Greg. So we'll keep reviewing the numbers, reviewing the programs, but what we're trying to do is take a very deliberate approach, because I think the terminology that you used earlier is important. Each of these have to be customer-friendly projects. So there has to be a reliability benefit, a cost benefit, a safety benefit, or environmental performance. It's really got to be something that's beneficial to our business and beneficial to our customers. So often that takes a little time to identify those kinds of projects.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. To what extent could changes in the potential mix of your generation fleet, as you look to de-carbonize, have an impact on that plan towards the backend, or would that potentially roll into the next decade, so that as you look at your coal fleet, and you start to think about how you are going to balance your carbon emissions.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. And I think certainly with Clean Power Plan, and this is, I'm speculating. I don't know exactly when the first year of compliance would be with Clean Power Plan, but it's likely not to be until 2024 or after. So I would not expect, Greg. Certainly if you look into the capital forecast going out to 2020, which is what we have on the table today, I don't really see any benefit at all, at least in this forecast period, meaning from this year to 2020, from the impacts of Clean Power Plan. But hypothetically if you had a 2024 compliance date, ultimately with Clean Power Plan, perhaps you could see some impacts out in that 2021, 2022, 2023 time period.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Two more quick questions. $0.55 to $0.59 assumes normal weather you said for the balance of the quarter, so I would presume it factors in what's happened to-date in terms of demand.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. And Scott, you may want to talk a little bit about July and what we've seen in July in terms of weather.","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes. Yes. So it does include the month of July weather. Now, what we saw in July was it started out actually cooler than normal the first couple days and it didn't catch up to about normal degree day until about the July 17. So we really just had some warm weather the last week, week-and-a-half of July here. So we factored that in. Maybe it's $0.015 to $0.02, but that's factored into our guidance.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So we should watch the weather for the balance of the quarter and think about that accordingly if it's above or below normal, because you're assuming normal?","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Final question. In the normal cadence of your discussions with the Wisconsin Commission, at what point do you go into them and discuss whether or not you'd like to defer having a rate review again as you did this year?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. Well, my expectation would be, if we follow past practice on timing, typically if you're going to do a filing, so let's say, for example, if we're going to do a filing in 2017 for rates that we request to be in effect in 2018, typically in the March-April timeframe you really need to make that filing. So if we follow past practice with timing, my expectation would be that soon after the New Year, January, February, you'd need to have some conversations with the staff about where we would propose to head. So that's how I would see the timing.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So a ways off. Thank you, guys.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes.","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, Good afternoon.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Two quick things. I heard your comments on the pension discount rate and I think you said you're working on building that into the plan, if you do see the $35 million increase in 2017. So should we take the comment of building it into the plant to mean you'd expect to absorb that within the stated growth rate?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes. And I would say, maybe, to give you some additional color. The $35 million, part of that, to the extent that you capitalize labor expense and there is a certain amount of labor that gets capitalized when people do work on capital projects, now there'll be some amount of this $35 million that would effectively get capitalized as a part of that. My guess would be, right now, perhaps that $6 million or $7 million out of the $35 million, so not all of it would hit the income statement. But, yes, we'll have to and we expect to offset this as a part of our plan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then just on transmission return and how you've reserved, you mentioned the ALJ being 9.7% plus 50 basis point adder. Is that the number you've actually reserved to? And is that what you're looking on a go-forward basis or are those numbers different from what the ALJ?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yes, let me go through it in three pieces, because of course there are two investigations, if you will. So, there is the first period that goes from, I think, November 2013, help me Scott...","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Sure. February 2015.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. And then we've got...","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","February to May 2016.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","...2016. So in that first period, Jonathan, we're reserving I believe effectively the recommendation from the ALJ including the 50 basis points was 10.82%. So we're reserving at that level for that first period. For the second period, we're reserving at 10.2%, and then it's sort of an educated guess, but my view right now would be the that 10.2% is a pretty good assumption going forward and 10.2% is what we will assume when we build up our plan, when we finish our plan for 2017. I'm sorry, that's kind of a long answer, but there are all these players for these investigations.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, that was very helpful. Thank you for the clarity on that. It's sometimes hard to keep track of. Thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay?","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, that's all. Good, thanks a lot.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hello, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah, hi, good afternoon. Just on the Illinois process, for the gas spending, just could you give a little more color on what is going to be kind of addressed in that process, just basically, let's finalize your new long-term investment plan?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and maybe let me sort of give this, maybe in parts. And let me first maybe just give a little more color about that staff report, Steve, that that was issued at the end of May. So really what that report did, effectively the staff did not make any recommendations about the program effectively. What they did is, that the staff summarized all of kind of the key input from the stakeholders in that workshop process that they had earlier this year. Then what the staff just essentially said is, well, we believe you should have a docket to address the program. And we think you should have reporting mechanisms about the program in the interim before you make a decision and in the long-term once the decision is made.","So really it's just kind of summary of what all the stakeholders said, and then in terms of what the commission would decide, at a high level what they said they want to do was cover the cost, scope and schedule for the near-term and the long-term. So, they still seemed to be of a very strong view that the program needs to continue. They just want to look again at the scope and the schedule, and in the interim, they fully understand that we're going to continue with that three-year program that I alluded to before, hopefully that's helpful, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Yeah. No, that's helpful. Just one other question on the pension, thank you for disclosing that information. I assume we're going to start hearing a lot more from other people. The normal course I assume that's a recoverable expense in rate cases?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, FAS 87 expense would generally be recoverable in your revenue requirements.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And so, but just in 2017, to a degree you don't have a rate case you'd have to manage the cost?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Exactly right, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi there, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hey.","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Hi.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","So perhaps a easy question here, just the dollar-for-dollar comment on the Presque Isle. Can you elaborate a little bit on what the assets there are?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. And I guess what I was really alluding to in the primary one or one of the ones is really escrow accounting, because sort of like when we talk about ROE investigations, these SSR agreements they were actually multiple agreements and they covered multiple periods. I think they go back as far as February of 2014.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Correct.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","And there were actually two agreements over that period and some of these periods, Julien, were covered by escrow accounting, so you were actually required by the regulators in Wisconsin to escrow both revenues as well as costs, so both revenues you received under the contract as well as the costs that might be allocated back to our utility through MISO. So what I was really referring to primarily is that those escrow mechanisms that might cover one or both of the periods.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just to be clear, I know this is Feb 14 through Jan 15, but would this have an ongoing impact just to 2016, 2017?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Because, the second SSR agreement, I believe ended in either February or April of 2015.","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","February of 2015.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","February of 2015, so this is all going back, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Thanks for that. Little bit more strategic here. I know last time on the call we kind of discussed storage little bit. Can you elaborate where you stand on that and also in the interim we've seen some of your large-cap peers move more explicitly into the midstream sector, what are your thoughts owning storage in midstream more broadly?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Right. And I think, well, first off on the storage, we are having conversations with two parties who are owners of storage and we'll see what we can work out with one of those, but we are having active conversations with two parties so let me just sort of put a line under that. And then looking forward, I guess our view would be on midstream, at least our view is that we would only be interested in these other natural gas assets and I'll just call them, I don't know whether to call them midstream or what to call them, Julien, but it's certainly upstream of the local gas distribution companies. Our only interest at this point would be in gas storage and it would be gas storage that we could in effect directly integrate with our local distribution company and place in rate base. So at this point, that's as far upstream as we're thinking, it's something that would be very much of another regulated asset play.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. All right, great. Well, thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Okay.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Hi, good afternoon.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Brian.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Just curious, what was the second quarter 2016 EPS impact versus normal?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","In terms of weather impact.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Scott, do you want to cover that?","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. The weather impact compared to normal, was about I think \u2013 all right, let me just pull our numbers up here. I think it was really only about $0.01.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. So, then I guess, the delta between what you actually reported and what you had guided to last quarter, is attributable to cost controls and the tech acquisition that's exceeding our expectations?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Initially as you recall on the first in April, it actually was a negative when we had the conference call, so we had earnings we thought were actually going to be down a little bit because of our April weather, and then as we covered then in the last part of the quarter here, so that helped us, so we had projected in our guidance a decline because of weather and then it turned round a little bit in the last part of the quarter here. And plus, we do have pretty good cost control and we saw some of our NIM decline a little bit.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got you. Okay. And then, in prior discussions you've mentioned that the people with gas pipeline replacement program has kind of physically maxed out on an annual basis, meaning just manpower or the amount of the street close at one time, et cetera. Can you comment on any of your other subsidiaries that have upside or headroom in some of their programs that can maybe fill in some of that CapEx that you're contemplating?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah, and then maybe just to give a little bit, if you look at, we talked about gas storage and that's certainly if we made that kind of investment, we would see that being rate base for the two or really three Wisconsin local distribution companies. Outside of Wisconsin we would see quite a bit of opportunity in, let's say, at Minnesota, at Merck, Michigan, at MGU, those companies don't have automated meter. So, we could certainly \u2013 that would be a very cost effective investment that we can make at those two companies. Anything you'd add Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, and remember what we added was really in 2015 and 2016 so maybe some of those programs that we already have, some of that can continue into 2017 through 2018 and 2019 timeframe, but we're still evaluating those, what we have in that 2016, 2017 range.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. And are you in a position to quantify maybe the gas reserve opportunity or the automated meters?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","The automated meters, they're probably on the range of $30 million to $40 million I would say, at each of the companies. The gas storage, that's completely dependent, Brian on how many Bcf you could buy at what price. So, I'd hesitate to put a number yet on the gas storage, but as I mentioned we are having discussions.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Understood. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Allen. Couple of easy questions for you. First, how do you \u2013 you've got $35 million roughly, maybe a little less because of the capitalization of pension O&M headwind. You have the headwind tied to 50 basis point, 60 basis point lower ROE at ATC. Is your O&M, and you don't have rate increases coming at the Wisconsin utilities. Are your O&M cost savings enough to offset all of those things?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, I believe so, but I would say at the Wisconsin utilities you're probably looking at having to have absolute declines in the O&M run rate. So, Scott, anything you'd like to add?","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. No, that's exactly the case. We'll have to continue at our cost control and manage every dollar like we have in the past. We'll also look at what we do on our financing cost, and we've put in there, maybe there is some investments we need to do in the pension plan also. So, we're evaluating a lot of different items items.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","But at this point, Michael, I would say that we still would have enough degrees of freedom that \u2013 so we could move to help offset this.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And O&M sequentially, meaning quarter-over-quarter, because the year-over-year is just complex given the merger close. Quarter-over-quarter was down $5 million, $6 million. Is that kind of a decent run rate to think about the amount of O&M reduction you can take out in a certain period?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, there's a lot of variables between the first quarter and second quarter. For example, the riders we have in Illinois, the riders from Illinois, it's about $10 million more expense in the first quarter than in the second quarter. So, there's some timing of those type of non-controllable O&M that I would not say that's a constant run rate that's going to come out quarter-over-quarter.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. That's very helpful. I have a question about 2016 guidance. If I take the midpoint of your guidance, so let's say $2.91. And then I take the midpoint of your third quarter guidance, so $0.57. And then I take what you've actually done year-to-date, so $0.57 in this period and $1.09 in the first period. That implies $0.68 for the fourth quarter, I mean, it's just subtraction. You did $0.66 last year in the fourth quarter, but last year, correct me if I'm wrong, you didn't have that much time or the benefit of the O&M savings, and you also had a little bit of an abnormally warm winter in the fourth quarter of last year, and you've become much more of a gas utility. Can you talk to me about what headwinds you may be facing in the fourth quarter of this year? Just because you're really implying really low growth year-over-year fourth quarter 2015 to fourth quarter 2016.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Yeah. Michael, I'm going to let Scott sort of fill in more of the number detail. But I think basically right now, we're being conservative about weather in the fourth quarter, and Scott talked about we've got much more of our earnings better in the first quarter and the fourth quarter because of the natural gas companies. Obviously, those are weather sensitive. So we're being conservative about weather. And as you pointed out, even on the base that we had before without the Integrys companies, you could have some big swings based on weather. You want to fill in a little bit of detail on that, Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, sure. When you look at the weather, specifically in the fourth quarter, and look at scenario now with the larger gas footprint, there is with a warmer fourth quarter potential of $0.08 to $0.09 hit in the fourth quarter related to weather. So we're just being very \u2013 making sure we can measure and manage into that fourth quarter.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","But I want to make sure I understand that. Are you implying that your base plan and your base cost guidance assumes abnormal weather?","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","No, the guidance assumes normal weather, but I'm committed to meeting that range regardless of what happens with weather in the fourth quarter, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. I'll follow-up offline. Thank you guys. Much appreciate it.","Allen L. Leverett - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director","Well, that concludes our conference call.

Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy\u2019s Conference Call to review 2012 first quarter results. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share, unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale Klappa","","Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review the company\u2019s 2012 first quarter results.","Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of We Generation; Rick Kuester, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Pat Keyes, our Treasurer; and Steve Dickson, Controller. Susan, of course, was recently promoted to the General Counsel position. She succeeds Jim Fleming, who retired just a few weeks ago.","Rick will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.74 a share for the first quarter of 2012. This compares with earnings of $0.72 a share for the first quarter of 2011.","Weather of course both regionally and nationally was the big story in the opening quarter of 2012. For Wisconsin Energy, the warmest winter in 122 years drove down residential demand for natural gas by nearly 24% compared to last year\u2019s first quarter. As you\u2019ll recall, sharply lower demand for natural gas prompted us to revise our first quarter earnings guidance on March 29. At the same time, we also reaffirmed our full year forecast.","Now, although the weather was a dominant factor in our first quarter results, there were several bright spots that I\u2019d like to briefly touch on. First, we had a positive swing of $17 million from the recovery of fuel costs in the quarter compared with the first quarter of 2011. We also recorded significantly lower operation and maintenance costs. That\u2019s largely because of the one-year holiday on regulatory amortizations approved by the Wisconsin Commission in the order that froze our base rates for 2012. We also had lower interest costs and there was an uptick in electric sales to our largest customers.","Turning now to the economy. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate at 6.8% in March, remains well below the national average. And as I mentioned, electric sales to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by 3% in the first quarter of 2012. The sector is showing particular strength in the past quarter include iron ore mining, heavy equipment manufacturing, and for the first time since the recession, the producers of rubber and plastic products.","We\u2019re also seeing a rebound in new customer connections. Compared to the low level of activity during the recession, electric customer connections were up 29% and connections of new natural gas customers rose by 33% over the 12-months ended March.","On the construction front, we have two major projects underway, the 50-megawatt biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin and the air quality control upgrade at the original Oak Creek units. We\u2019re making excellent progress on the biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin. We\u2019ve already topped out the structural steel for the boiler and the steel structure for the turbine and fuel storage buildings are now 90% complete. Construction of the cooling tower is underway as well as excavation work for the auxiliary boiler.","As I\u2019ve noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. We\u2019ll be able to dispatch the unit in the efficient technology that will produce steam for the operating paper mill of the site will clearly enhance the economics of the project. Our investment of the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We\u2019re on schedule and on budget and meet the completion date by the end of 2013.","Of course, the biomass project and Glacier Hills Wind Park that we completed late last year are key components that will help us meet Wisconsin\u2019s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity delivered from renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level.","The standard sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using an historical baseline. Using that baseline approximately 8.27% of our retail sales of electricity must come from renewable sources in the year 2015. When we complete the biomass project, we\u2019ll be well positioned to meet that 2015 standard. I should point out, however, that we expect to deplete our bank of renewable credits and as a result, we expect to need additional credits or additional renewable generation in the year 2017.","Finally, we\u2019re in the last stages of completing the air quality control upgrade for the older coal-fired units at our Oak Creek site. The four older units at Oak Creek are still among the most efficient base load units in the Midwest. So the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million, including allowance for funds used during construction for the installation of wet scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction facilities.","This is the second largest construction project in the company\u2019s history and I\u2019m pleased to report that the wet scrubber and the selective catalytic reduction equipment for Units 5 and 6 at Oak Creek were placed into commercial service on March 3. This state-of-the-art equipment is performing well. It\u2019s performing as we expected and we\u2019re meeting or exceeding all of the applicable emission standards.","For Units 7 and 8 at Oak Creek, we\u2019re now focused on initial tuning and testing of the new air quality controls. We\u2019re targeting an in-service date for the Unit 7 and 8 controls later this summer and we remain on budget for the project.","Now I\u2019d like to spend just a moment on the impact we\u2019re seeing from the current conditions in the coal and natural gas markets. As all of you know, natural gas prices are at extremely low levels. At this point, spot prices are about $2.35 per million Btu and forward prices for the summer are in the $2.35 to $2.55 per million Btu range. This is clearly influencing locational marginal prices in the MISO market.","But over the years, the key to successfully serving customers at competitive prices has been fuel diversity, and fuel diversity was the major focus of our Power of the Future plan. You may remember that the plan called for the retirement of nearly 600 megawatts of older less efficient coal-fired capacity. At the same time, the new capacity that we added was almost equally balanced between natural gas and coal. Of the approximately 2,200 megawatts that we built in the past decade, 1,090 megawatts was natural gas fired combined cycle capacity and 1,056 megawatts was highly efficient pulverized coal capacity.","Another important point. About 80% of the coal that we use is Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal. Although the new Oak Creek expansion units are currently fueled with bituminous coal, we\u2019re seeking the flexibility to burn blends of bituminous and sub-bituminous coal there in the future.","Overall, we\u2019re projecting to burn just under 9 million tons of coal this year versus 10.7 million tons in 2011. We\u2019ll achieve this reduction by carrying out planned burns, maximizing the use of storage and working with our coal suppliers to defer, buy out or renegotiate several existing contracts.","Natural gas will take up the slack. Our natural gas burn is expected to nearly double from 28.5 Bcf last year to 50 Bcf this year. In fact, our natural gas units at Port Washington operated at about a 60% capacity factor in the first quarter of this year. The Port Washington units are essentially now being dispatched in the MISO market as baseload units. So overall, I believe we\u2019re well positioned to adjust as the markets for coal and natural gas continue to evolve and for calendar year 2012, we expect to fully recover our fuel costs.","Now I\u2019ll briefly review where we stand on the regulatory fronts in both Wisconsin and Michigan. As you may recall, our electric customers in Wisconsin are seeing no increase in base rates during 2012. We developed a creative approach to push off for a year an increase in base rates as the economy continues to recover here.","Looking ahead, we have filed a rate request with the Wisconsin Commission, seeking an increase for electric and steam customers for 2013 and 2014 and a decrease in base rates for our natural gas customers in 2013.","The base rate adjustments we\u2019re seeking are driven by approximately $1.6 billion of capital investments that the Commission previously approved, the strength and reliability to meet environmental requirements and to comply with Wisconsin\u2019s renewable energy mandate.","Projects previously approved by the Commission include the air quality control system for the older units at Oak Creek, the Glacier Hills Wind Park, the biomass facility in Northern Wisconsin and the Oak Creek expansion units. Our proposal in this particular rate case includes using a federal grant that we expect to receive for our biomass facility. After applying this cash grant, the result would be a net customer bill impact of a 3.6% increase in 2013 and another 3.6% in 2014.","Our filing also includes an estimate of fuel costs for 2013, but that\u2019s simply a placeholder at this point because our fuel cost projections will be updated and finalized later this year.","On the natural gas distribution front, we proposed a decrease in the base rates for customers of our two gas distribution utilities in the year 2013. We\u2019re seeking a 2.3% decrease for Wisconsin Gas customers and a 0.2% decrease for Wisconsin Electric Gas customers. For 2014, we\u2019re proposing the base rates then remain flat.","For our steam utility, we filed for an increase in 2013 of approximately 6% for our downtown Milwaukee customers and approximately 7% for our Milwaukee County customers. In 2014, our proposal calls for an increase of 6% for both of those customer groups.","We expect the Wisconsin Commission to hold technical hearings on our requests later this year and to issue orders before the end of 2012. We\u2019ve requested that the new rates go into effect at the start of 2013 and 2014 respectively. We\u2019ll keep you updated as developments unfold.","Turning now to our Michigan operations. You\u2019ll recall that in July of 2011, we filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission for an annual rate increase of $17.5 million. We\u2019re seeking to recover from Michigan customers their pro rata share of renewable generation, environmental controls and costs associated with the second expansion unit at Oak Creek.","In late December, the Commission decided or directed, I should say, the company to self-implement a $5.7 million rate increase that took effect on January 5, 2012. The Commission\u2019s directive also authorized the company to implement a $2.7 million credit of the proceeds we received from a settlement with the Department of Energy. Applying the credit, the net effect of the interim rate increase is $3 million or about 1.7%.","We expect the Michigan Commission to rule on our entire request by July 5 of this year. In addition, approximately $2 million of renewable costs were included in our Michigan fuel recovery rate and that was effective January 1 of this year. So the total self-implementation was $7.7 million annually.","Switching gears now, a quick reminder that our board has authorized a share repurchase plan scheduled to run through the end of 2013 that calls for us to buy back up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. No purchases were made under the plan in the first quarter of this year. Through today, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at a cost of $100 million. That equates to an average purchase price of $30.79 a share.","And as we previously announced, our board has adopted a dividend policy that calls for us to reach a 60% payout ratio in the year 2014. This policy should support double-digit growth in the dividend in both 2013 and 2014 as we work to achieve a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. We took another major step forward in January by approving a dividend increase of 15% bringing our new dividend rate for 2012 to $1.20 a share.","And finally, I\u2019d like to briefly discuss the investment opportunities we have in our core business. Our latest capital budget calls for spending $3.5 billion over the five-year period 2012 through 2016. In our 2012 through 2016 budget, the nature of our capital investments is shifting, shifting away from an emphasis on generation involving high profile projects such as our Power of the Future units, renewable generation and large air quality controls.","Instead, our capital plan is primarily comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. The building blocks of our delivery business, pipes, polls, wires, transformers. The primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory, construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the mega projects we\u2019ve just completed. Our focus on upgrading and renewing our distribution facilities is essential for maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest.","So in summary, as we look back at the first quarter, our customers enjoyed basking in Miami-like weather in January, February, and March and we continue to make solid progress on our financial and operational goals.","Now before I turn the call over to Rick, I\u2019m pleased to share with you one more piece of good news. For the fifth year in a row, Wisconsin Energy was named one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in the United States by Corporate Responsibility Magazine.","On that note, here\u2019s our Chief Financial Officer and a darn fine citizen in his own right, Rick Kuester. Rick?","Frederick Kuester","","Thanks, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier, our 2012 first quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.74 a share compared to $0.72 a share in 2011. You will notice that our net income increased by just over $1 million. However, earnings per share increased by $0.02. This increase reflects the impact of our share repurchase program, which began in 2011. We estimate that the share repurchases we completed in 2011 will boost our earnings for the full-year 2012 by $0.03 per share.","Now as we take a closer look at the numbers, I will focus on the earnings drivers at the operating income level by business segment and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows in the quarter.","Our consolidated operating income in the first quarter of 2012 was $296 million, which was the same as first quarter of 2011. Starting with Utility Energy segment, you will see that operating income totaled $209 million, a decrease of $4 million versus 2011. The most significant factor in the quarter was the record warmth that we experienced. The quarter ended with slightly cooler temperatures during the last three days, which help boost us to $0.20 \u2013 excuse me to $0.74 a share.","We estimate that our electric and gas margins were reduced by $49 million as compared to last year and $34 million as compared to normal weather. Partially offsetting the impact of weather were our collections on fuel, which improved by $17 million as compared to 2011 and a reduction in our O&M costs of $25 million at the utility level.","We had favorable first quarter fuel recoveries because our fuel filing request was approved on January 5 of this year. Last year, our fuel filing request was not approved until late April. The reduction in O&M cost is related to the one-year amortization holiday of certain regulatory assets. As you will remember from prior calls, last year we reached an agreement with the Wisconsin Commission that allowed us to freeze base electric rates in 2012.","One of the provisions in the agreement was the ability to stop the amortization of approximately $148 million associated with regulatory assets. This action will reduce O&M by $148 million during 2012, which will flow evenly through the year. This agreement was designed to help our customers afford price increases in this economy and allow shareholders to earn returns on the capital projects that Gale discussed earlier.","Operating income in the Non-Utility Energy segment, which consists primarily of the Power the Future units was up by $4 million. Unit 2 at Oak Creek was placed in service on January 12, 2011 so we realized a full quarter\u2019s earnings on the unit in 2012. Last year, we only realized a partial quarter\u2019s earnings on Unit 2.","In addition, we finalized the depreciable loss of these units, which had a slight positive impact on earnings. The increased earnings in the Non-Utility segment offset the reduced earnings from the Utility. Our corporate and other segment were also unchanged from the prior year, which gets us back to level consolidated operating income.","During the first quarter of 2012, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company increased just slightly over 2011. Our other income increased slightly because of higher AFUDC associated with the air quality control project and the biomass project.","Net interest expense decreased by $4 million. We saw a reduction in our gross interest expense as we retired $450 million in holding company debt in April 2011. Consolidated income tax expense rose by approximately $7 million because of higher pre-tax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $172 million of net income from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2012 or earnings of $0.74 per share.","During the quarter, we generated $361 million of funds from operations, which is a $7 million increase from the same period in 2011. This year\u2019s cash flows were helped because no contributions were needed for our qualified benefit plans. Those plans are fully funded. In the first quarter of last year, we contributed $122 million to our qualified plans. This item was offset by several smaller charges, including a reduction in regulatory amortizations of $37 million associated with the amortization holiday discussed previously.","Our total capital expenditures increased by approximately $7 million in the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011. We saw increased expenditures associated with the biomass plant and within our coal utility operations. The warm weather did allow us to get a head start for the year on our capital projects.","We also paid $69 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2012, which was $8 million greater than the same period last year. As Gale mentioned, the first quarter dividends equate to an annual dividend of $1.20 per share, which is a 15% increase over the prior year\u2019s annual dividend of $1.04 per share.","Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 53.3% as of March 31, 2012. Our adjusted calculations treat half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401-K plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","As shown in the earnings package on our website, our actual first quarter 2012 retail sales of electricity decreased by 1% as compared to the same quarter a year ago. On a weather-normalized basis, first quarter 2012 retail electric sales were up 1.1%. Excluding the mines, normalized first quarter sales increased by 0.3%. As you recall, we had two customers that are utilizing their own self-generation in 2012. Adjusting for these customers and the mines on a normalized basis, we saw retail sales grow by 0.6%. Overall, these results were in line with our 2012 sales forecast.","As we look at our natural gas sales, we saw retail sales decrease almost 24% during the first quarter of 2012 as compared to the first quarter of 2011 due to the warm winter. Excluding the effects of weather, our natural gas sales are in line with our annual forecasts.","Our 2012 earnings guidance remains the same as we what provided to you on our February conference call. We expect our earnings for 2012 to be in the range of $2.24 to $2.29 per share. While our first quarter earnings fell below our original guidance because of record warm weather, we have taken actions to control spending and we have seen lower fuel and purchased power cost driven by the low natural gas prices. In addition, our interest costs are projected to be lower than originally forecasted.","Before I turn things back over to Gale, I would like to provide quarterly guidance. Factoring in lower sales in April due to weather, we estimate second quarter earnings will be in the $0.40 to $0.43 per share range.","With that, I\u2019ll turn things back over to Gale.","Gale Klappa","","Rick, thank you very much. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","","And now, we would like to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with Konolige Research.","Gale Klappa","","Hi, Kit. Good afternoon.","Kit Konolige \u2013 Konolige Research","","Good afternoon to all you at Miami on Lake Michigan.","Gale Klappa","","There you go.","Kit Konolige \u2013 Konolige Research","","All right. Good for golf, right. So I think Rick you mentioned no issuance of shares. Can we extrapolate from the first quarter that there\u2019s no share repurchases likely at the current stock price?","Frederick Kuester","","Well, Kit, I wouldn\u2019t start extrapolating. I guess, I would back up and just say we \u2013 because of the free cash flow that we have, we\u2019ve identified a number of uses for that cash. First and foremost is to reinvest in our business. Second, is to increase our dividend and as you\u2019re aware we\u2019ve accelerated our target to get to 60% by a year. So we\u2019ll be there in 2014. Then we\u2019re looking opportunistically at basically buying shares or reducing debt at the holding company. And we want to make good economic choices. We don\u2019t want to sit on a bunch of cash. We\u2019ve got a program that basically is authorized out through 2013 to buy back shares. And we will continue to look at that every quarter and just see what makes the most sense for shareholders.","Kit Konolige \u2013 Konolige Research","","Okay. Very good. Let me ask one more on sales. Can you give us any further color on \u2013 I mean, are you guys able to see whether it\u2019s commercial versus residential that\u2019s the kind of relative weakness as an offset to the somewhat improving industrial sales?","Gale Klappa","","Actually, Kit, because of the unusual weather in Q1, is way more than two standard deviations off norm. We all are a little bit skeptical of how effective the weather normalization techniques that the industry uses really are when you get that far off norm. So I wouldn\u2019t put a lot of stock in the precision of the weather normalized first quarter numbers, but directionally they are correct and every one of the categories is up on a weather normalized basis.","The one that seems to be at least for the first quarter lagging a little bit would be small commercial but that was not the case last year. So my sense is, when you look at the pickup in industrial demand and when you look at the pickup in the customer connections that I mentioned, we are seeing some stronger economic activity. Rick, anything to add?","Frederick Kuester","","I think you hit it, Gale.","Kit Konolige \u2013 Konolige Research","","Great. Thank you, guys.","Gale Klappa","","Thanks, Kit.","Frederick Kuester","","Thanks, Kit.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Gale Klappa","","How are you today, Paul?","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Hey, how are you doing?","Gale Klappa","","We\u2019re good.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Just to sort of follow-up on that. I mean I realized it\u2019s more of an art than a science here. But just to make sure I understood this. It\u2019s 0.3% was what the weather normalized sales growth was? Is that correct?","Gale Klappa","","Yeah. That\u2019s excluding the mines.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Excluding the mines and with the mines it\u2019s about 0.6%?","Gale Klappa","","I believe that\u2019s correct.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Okay. And does that include leap year?","Gale Klappa","","Yes, it does include leap year.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Okay. So it would actually be negative if we were to take out the effect of leap year, right?","Gale Klappa","","You could probably come to that conclusion. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily think that\u2019s a firm conclusion. Again, thinking about the deficiency of the technique, the weather normalization technique, when you have this kind of disparity in the weather. My own sense is we\u2019re seeing a little bit stronger pickup particularly on the industrial side and my guess is we\u2019re going to see a bit of a rebound if weather ever comes back to normal here on the commercial side because we did last year, commercial was stronger than we expected last year.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Okay. And then the Prairie Ville I think it is and probably messing this up to Zion line that got approved?","Gale Klappa","","Pleasant Prairie to Zion.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Sorry. Pleasant Prairie to Zion. Could you guys give us any flavors to what you think that might do with respect to congestion and with respect to imports or exports into Illinois?","Gale Klappa","","Sure. We\u2019ll ask Allen Leverett to give you his views since he represents us on the Board of American Transmission Company but let me just for everybody\u2019s sake kind of clarify what Paul\u2019s talking about. The Pleasant Prairie to Zion line is an important link to strengthen the transmission network and relieve some congestion between the very far southern chunk of the state of Wisconsin and Illinois. It\u2019s only about a five-mile line, but an important additional interconnect. Allen?","Allen Leverett","","Yes. And, Paul, it\u2019s a 345 kV segment, if you will. I would expect at this point that they would bring it in service in 2014. And effectively, what it will allow us to do, often we get in a situation right now where we have generation that you sort of think of it as being shut in, where you can\u2019t \u2013 if you had no transmission constraint, you\u2019d able to export much more to the south. So it\u2019ll open that up a bit and should result in some savings for our customers. It\u2019s hard to say, Paul, because you don\u2019t know precisely what the situation will be on the transmission system, but I could easily see savings to our customers in say a $15 million to $20 million a year range.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Okay.","Allen Leverett","","From a fuel standpoint. So no earnings, certainly no earnings impact for us, but some nice savings we hope for our customers.","Gale Klappa","","And they would expect to complete both the Illinois and Wisconsin Commissions have now approved the construction of the line and they would expect to complete it before the end of 2013.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","So, good for customers and perhaps a little bit depressing to the power markets in Illinois, all things being equal?","Gale Klappa","","They\u2019re depressed already.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","","Yeah, they are. Thank you very much.","Gale Klappa","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with UBS.","Gale Klappa","","Jim, how are you today?","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","I\u2019m well. Thanks. How are you, guys?","Gale Klappa","","Glad you made it back from London. I was concerned for a while there.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","Question, two questions actually. The first one is, when you think about your story prospectively, are you a growth story or a yield story?","Gale Klappa","","I think we\u2019re both. When you think about our risk-adjusted growth profile going forward of 4% to 6% as we\u2019ve said, we think the risk-adjusted returns off that growth are very solid, and then certainly we have, for the next several years, what I would think would be one of, if not the best, dividend growth story in the industry.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","So let\u2019s just \u2013 doing the math here, if you\u2019re growing dividends at 10% a year and it\u2019s now 2014, which is where you want to be a 60% payout ratio, you\u2019re talking numbers in the 240 to 245 range, how do you get to that 4% to 6% growth going forward?","Gale Klappa","","Well, I think if you look at the $3.5 billion capital program that we\u2019ve laid out for the period 2012 through 2016, you sprinkle in some opportunistic share buybacks under our share buyback authorization and you assume that we earn close to our allowed rates of return, that\u2019s how we get there.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","Okay. Second question. I\u2019ll follow up more offline with you on that. Second question is on the current state of the political affairs in Wisconsin. Can you give us an update on the Governor Walker recall campaign as well as the senate recall campaigns?","Gale Klappa","","Sure, I\u2019d be happy to, Jim. Well, first of all, I think the good news is, the endless election cycle is about to come to an end for a while. The dates for the recall election process have been set and the first date is next week actually, when there will be a primary to determine the Democratic candidate who will run against Governor Walker in the recall election.","Two candidates, well, two principal candidates, there are number of candidates but the two leading candidates on the Democratic side in the polls would be Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett and former Dane County Executive Kathleen Falk. So they probably will be the two largest vote getters on the Democratic side. Don\u2019t know which will win but we\u2019ll find out very soon. So one of those two candidates likely to face Governor Walker in the recall election and the date for that election has been set for June 5. So June 5 would be the recall election date. In that recall election, there will be a recall election for the governor\u2019s office. There will be a recall election for the lieutenant governor\u2019s office and there will be a recall election for four state senators.","I think one interesting side note, really, the state legislature has adjourned for the year. So there\u2019s no planned meetings between now and the next election, which should be in November. So there\u2019s really no activity unless there\u2019s some kind of special session that would fall out of the senate recall elections if I\u2019m making any sense.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","You are. So in the senate recall election, if memory serves me correctly, if it\u2019s a successful one, the balance of the power shifts from the Republicans to the Democrats, right?","Frederick Kuester","","It\u2019s actually 16\/16 now, Jim.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","Okay.","Gale Klappa","","If someone resigned, it\u2019s tied now. So if the Republicans lost any seats in the senate recall elections, the balance of power would shift but from a practical standpoint unless there\u2019s a special session. There is no power to \u2013 behind the shift.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","So \u2013 oops, sorry.","Frederick Kuester","","And the assembly is still solidly Republican.","Gale Klappa","","The assembly is still solidly Republican. And then there will be a normal election for state senate seats in November.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","Okay. How do you think under various circumstances the energy policy in the State of Wisconsin moves around? I mean, what\u2019s the prospects for extending or killing renewables doing a state-owned generation sale, et cetera?","Gale Klappa","Well, I think there are probably two pivot points here. One is certainly on the issue you raised, which is renewables. Both of the Democratic candidates for governor have mentioned in their stump speeches that they would want to reemphasize construction of renewable generation particularly wind in Wisconsin. So in my judgment, we probably would see a movement back toward construction of additional renewables to a greater degree under a Democratic administration than under the current administration. On the other hand, I don\u2019t believe any of the Democratic candidates for governor are supportive of privatizing the state-owned power plants.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks.","Gale Klappa","","Okay. Thank you, Jim. Good questions.","Jim von Riesemann \u2013 UBS","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Gale Klappa","","Rock and roll, Greg. How are you?","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","I\u2019m great. How are you guys?","Gale Klappa","","We\u2019re hanging in there. We\u2019re doing fine.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","So just to circle back a little bit to the beginning of JVR\u2019s question. So \u2013 and it dovetails with sort of the list of potential incremental rate base growth projects on Page 20 of your handout. As we look at your plan, you lay out some very clear building blocks that look like all things equal, they get you to at a minimum \u2013 at a bare minimum the low end of your earnings growth aspiration. Is it fair to presume that if you were able to bring any of these sort of six different options to the finish line in lieu of incremental buybacks that that would \u2013 that\u2019s what kind of pushes you to the high end of the growth rate?","Gale Klappa","","Well, as Rick said, priority one is investing in the core business. So if we find that these have to be real projects with real value to customers and shareholders, and if we find those projects, that\u2019s where we will focus our investment opportunity.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","But they\u2019re not in your base case. These are sort of things that are \u2013 it could be incremental if they\u2019re deemed to be in the best interest of customers, but they\u2019re not currently in the base case?","Gale Klappa","","Well, for example, the first one on Page 20, investing in fuel blending at the new Oak Creek coal units, I believe that\u2019s not a big investment, but it is certainly is in our base case.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","Okay.","Gale Klappa","","Renewable energy beyond 2016 is not additional investment beyond what we have identified in the ageing gas and electric distribution infrastructure. It is not future EPA rules, beyond the ones we\u2019re aware of is not and certainly divestiture of the energy assets by the State of Wisconsin is not. So the majority of them, Greg, are not.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","Okay. I just wanted to be clear what you guys were counting on versus not counting on in the plan. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","","Does that help?","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","","Yes. Very much so.","Gale Klappa","","Great. Thank you, Greg.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Gale Klappa","","How\u2019s it going, Michael?","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","I\u2019m okay, Gale, yourself?","Gale Klappa","","We\u2019re doing well.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Good to hear. A couple of questions and this maybe an Allen question. Thinking about the ATC CapEx forecast for the next few years. Just curious, why the downward trajectory?","Gale Klappa","","Allen is looking at a page right now in front of him.","Allen Leverett","","Well, this doesn\u2019t have the capital. But in terms of the capital projection, I think that they finished a number of pretty large projects, Michael, and as you know, the transmission investments are pretty lumpy. So they finished those big projects and now the sort of next big projects that are on the horizon, you probably heard them talk about the \u2013 or heard us talk about Madison-LaCrosse. That\u2019s a big 345 kV line east west. So that\u2019s really the next big project that\u2019s out there. And then you have to go to 2015, 2016 to sort of see another really big round of projects. So I think, at this point, strictly because of the lumpiness of the investments.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","So is it pretty safe to assume that, I mean, kind of the $38 million to $40 million a year rate base growth. So you get a little bit of earnings growth contribution out of ATC longer term. Is ATC up year-over-year? Like when I think about your 2012 guidance, is ATC\u2019s contribution higher in 2012 than 2011? It was relatively flat in the first quarter, so I just want to kind of check through that.","Gale Klappa","","Up slightly in 2012 over 2011, but I think to Allen\u2019s point, Michael, maybe there\u2019s a couple of time differentiators that we can do to here, because clearly, ATC has announced about a $4 billion capital plan over the next 10 years. That\u2019s materially larger than their last 10. But as Allen pointed out, they\u2019re coming off completing very significant various investments. They have a bit of, from that standpoint, a bit of a lower capital spend in the next four or five years, and then it ramps us materially again because of the lumpiness and the time it takes to site and construct.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. Two last -","Frederick Kuester","","One last thing on the ATC earnings, Michael, they are in line, over the next five years, they are in line with our 4% to 6% growth rate. So they support that growth rate. And then they actually tick up after that because of the backend loading of the capital budget.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Got it. So ATC growth is similar to core utility growth?","Gale Klappa","","Over the next several years and then higher.","Frederick Kuester","","And then goes higher.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. One or two other items. Balance sheet plans for this year, when you think about kind of what\u2019s embedded in guidance for total debt issuances versus retirements 2012 relative to where you\u2019ve ended 2011. Can you just kind of give us some insight there of what\u2019s embedded in your guidance level?","Gale Klappa","","Yeah. We\u2019ll be happy to and then Pat or Rick can certainly add to anything that I\u2019ve got to offer here but we don\u2019t have any real maturities coming due in 2012. That\u2019s for starters. We did, in our capital plan assume a bond offering at Wisconsin Electric for in the neighborhood of $250 million for at some point this year, which we have not yet finally determined that date.","Patrick Keyes","","Yeah, that\u2019s right.","Gale Klappa","","But basically, that\u2019s about it.","Patrick Keyes","","Yeah, that\u2019s right, Gale. And Michael, this is Pat. I can just add that that net net at the end of 2012 we\u2019ll be up slightly in a total debt that we were over 2011 and that\u2019s just to fund all the things that Rick just walked through.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","And that assumes no early retirements of holdco debt?","Patrick Keyes","","That is correct.","Gale Klappa","","That is correct.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. Last item. You\u2019re benefiting from \u2013 and I\u2019d love if you could just kind of repeat a little bit, you\u2019ve talked about this prior \u2013 from significant cash inflows related to deferred taxes. You got a big cash inflow I think earlier in the first quarter. Can you just talk about that in terms of what\u2019s embedded in that kind of cash flow statement item in 2012 in your guidance level for 2012? And then how should we think about what happens longer term?","Gale Klappa","","Let me first, Michael, talk about the longer term and I think probably the best way to capsulize it is that based on our projections, we expect to have approximately $600 million of free cash flow over the period 2012 through 2016. And our definition of free cash flow would be after capital spending and after dividends. So after capital spending and after dividends, about $600 million of free cash between now and 2016. Frankly, the year-to-year breakdown is kind of immaterial here because it depends upon the level of capital spending and the timing of capital spending in any given year. So I think probably our best explanation to you is just that, the 2012 through 2016, approximately $600 million.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Okay. Can you also talk about the deferred tax benefit in 2012 because I know there was a \u2013 I thought there was a big cash inflow expected in the first quarter related to some of the new Oak Creek units. I just want to make sure I\u2019m kind of following the cash flows this year correctly.","Gale Klappa","","Certainly, I know what you\u2019re talking about. We\u2019ll let Steve Dickson mention this to you but the influx of cash I don\u2019t believe is a first quarter event here.","Stephen Dickson No. It\u2019s tied to our timing of periodic payments. And basically, as we\u2019ve disclosed in the 10-K is we do not expect to pay federal income taxes this year because of the benefits that we got in depreciation in prior years. So there\u2019s no slug of cash coming in. It\u2019s more of not having to make estimated payments.","Frederick Kuester","","What you might be thinking about, Michael, in the first quarter we announced that we received the private letter ruling from the IRS in December of last year that basically confirmed that accelerated depreciation could be applied to the expansion units, the coal expansion units at Oak Creek site. And there was $285 million cash \u2013 it\u2019s basically a timing benefit by the end of 2014 associated with that PLR.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","And so that\u2019s different than the bonus depreciation or that\u2019s all tied together?","Gale Klappa","","Well, it is a form of bonus depreciation.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Right.","Gale Klappa","","But the difference is this particular Private Letter Ruling that Rick just mentioned applies to WE Power and not to utility. So it does not, in essence reduce rate base growth.","Frederick Kuester","","We had previously announced bonus depreciation benefits that went to reduce rate base on our large air quality control projects and renewable projects as a result of the law that was passed and signed by the President, I think in December 2010. So kind of two announcement, one dealt with regulated business and then we got the PLR that dealt with the non-regulated business and we announced that in the first quarter.","Gale Klappa","","Michael, I know you know this but just so that we don\u2019t get descended upon by protesters saying we don\u2019t pay federal taxes, this is a timing benefit. And the company will owe hundreds of millions of dollars of taxes in future years.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","","Understood. Understood. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. I may follow-up offline afterwards.","Gale Klappa","","Very good. Thank you, Michael.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Gale Klappa","","Good afternoon, Brian. How are you?","Brian Russo \u2013 Ladenburg Thalmann","","Good, thank you. Actually, all of my questions have been asked and answered, thanks.","Gale Klappa","","All right. Take care, Brian.","Frederick Kuester","","Thanks.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities.","Gale Klappa","","How are you doing today?","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","Very well, thanks. How are you?","Gale Klappa","","We\u2019re well.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","Great. Couple of questions starting if I can with Rick. You mentioned the share repurchase would have an impact of $0.03 in fiscal year 2012 and I just wondered if there\u2019s an underlying assumption in that or is that just simply the impact of what\u2019s been completed to-date?","Frederick Kuester","","It\u2019s what\u2019s been completed to date, which was back in \u2013 last year. That\u2019s the effect of that.","Gale Klappa","","$100 million purchased at an average price of $30.79.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","That\u2019s great. And then, Gale, just revisiting an earlier question they took you through slide 20 of your recent slide deck. And what\u2019s not in CapEx currently that you identified, were you to go forward with that, would reduce the share repurchase, right? So we shouldn\u2019t really double count here. If your CapEx does rise, that will limit your ability to repurchase shares holding all things constant.","Gale Klappa","","You\u2019re exactly right, Jay, that\u2019s a very good point, and you are correct.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","That\u2019s perfect. If we can then to switch to the Wisconsin rate case. I know a lot of your peers there in the state are filing rate cases; in fact, all to my recollection.","Gale Klappa","","We\u2019ve got a lot of company, Jay.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","Exactly, sometimes that\u2019s good, sometimes that\u2019s bad. But in the context of that, I wanted to see, is there an opportunity to settle the current case. Yours is a little more complex than some of your peers, but just wanted to have your early read on the ability to settle it, if you could.","Gale Klappa","","Well, good question, Jay. I think first of all, the history in Wisconsin is not one of settlements. I don\u2019t think actually there\u2019s been a settled rate case in the nine years our team has been here for any of the Wisconsin utilities that I\u2019m aware of. I think there may be one other utility that thinks they can come close to zero this year that might be able to do a settlement. So I wouldn\u2019t say there\u2019s a high probability of a settlement in the rate case. However, there is a lot of work going on by the Commission staff, by all of the utilities and by the intervener groups to try to narrow the issues that will be contested in the case.","And from that standpoint, I think our case is very straightforward. I mentioned earlier, the case is really driven by about $1.6 billion of capital investment that was previously approved by the Commission that has come into service that is now serving customers is used and useful and we brought those projects in essentially on time and on budget. So that actually simplifies the case a tremendous amount. So I would say, in our case, there won\u2019t be but about three or four, maximum five contested issues and the parties will nail down those issues in a prehearing conference starting on May 21.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","Okay. That is great. Thank you. And then last question, I guess, for Rick, but anyone can chime in. So regarding the guidance and you sort of indicated that the weather in the first quarter is weighing against you, things like O&M and fuel recoveries as well as lower interest cost will help you over the balance of the year. I wanted to talk about two of those items. O&M first, just what are our incremental opportunities from here as you continue to squeeze costs out? Is it it\u2019s always there and we can just squeeze more? Or is it in fact a finite opportunity?","Gale Klappa","","Well, I\u2019ll start. Rick, Pat, Allen can certainly chime in. The big driver in the O&M reduction this year, just to refresh everyone\u2019s memory, is embedded in our rate order that froze electric rates for customers through 2012. Basically, we asked for and received permission to stop amortizing $148 million of regulatory assets over the course of 2012 and that order allows us to stop the amortization in equal quarterly increments.","So for example, I think, the number this quarter was $37 million and people are nodding their head yes. So you can expect a comparable number when we report in terms of O&M reduction from that item when we report in Q2, Q3, and Q4. That\u2019s the big driver this year. We\u2019ve also asked all of our major business functions to operate at no O&M increase and in some cases, an O&M decrease for 2012. We\u2019re on target with those initiatives. Rick?","Frederick Kuester","","Yeah. I would also say, Jay, that last year, we had a hot summer and we released some projects at the end of the year. For example, there was a major turbine rebuild that needed to be done. So some of those projects that are episodic in nature won\u2019t be flowing through at the end of this year. So, there\u2019ll be \u2013 you\u2019ll see probably a more positive benefit from O&M in the second half of the year than you would in the first half of the year.","Gale Klappa","","Very good point.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","That\u2019s great. Very helpful. And then the last question just on the lower fuel recoveries. I assume you have baked into that your concept of plan to burn, and I wouldn\u2019t mind it if you sort of expanded upon that on just how you \u2013 there\u2019s a couple of different definitions floating around of economic and planned burn when you\u2019re talking to some of these coal burns. So if you would talk about that and then I assume that\u2019s baked in here, but obviously as fuel costs change that may impact that. So, if you just can give us a little clarity on that.","Gale Klappa","","Sure, Jay. Very good question and let me just frame it and then we\u2019ll let Allen provide you the details. What is baked into our guidance now for the remainder of the year is an assumption that we will fully recover our fuel costs. That there won\u2019t be any reduction of earnings from a lack of recovery of fuel cost. And as we mentioned in the prepared remarks related to our coal deliveries and our coal costs, we had a variety of initiatives underway ranging from planned burns to turn back of coal to some buyouts. Allen, I know we have ongoing discussions with the coal companies.","Allen Leverett","","Right. And, Jay, we talked \u2013 or Gale talked about in the script that we\u2019re going to probably bring the burn from about 10.7 million tons last year to just under 9 million this year. And then Gale talked about the range of things we would do to try to achieve that. We\u2019ll certainly try to pick the mix of those things that are best from an economic standpoint for our customers. My view right now is that we would be more heavily weighted to doing the defer buyout renegotiate route for existing contracts as opposed to the planned burn route or storage route.","But we\u2019ll just have to see kind of where the numbers take us. When we say planned burn though, Jay, what we mean by that is you basically would target a number of tons that you would want to burn and then given where we are right now, or at least where we\u2019re forecasted to be with location and marginal prices, we would actually discount our offer in the market.","So we would discount the offer that we would put in for that unit when we put it in to MISO into the day ahead market so that we\u2019d get enough run time to burn through much coal. So you\u2019d actually be discounting, if you will, your offer price in order to achieve a certain level of burn. I\u2019m making sense.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","No. That makes a lot of sense and I appreciate that. Just on the point you offered Allen, if you were to work on renegotiating the contract assuming economic principles prevail, that would essentially just be pushing out the impact into future years.","Allen Leverett","","Not necessarily.","Gale Klappa","","Not necessarily. No.","Allen Leverett","","In some cases, it could be a push-out of deliveries. In other cases, it might just be well, you just pay liquidated damages and you just turn back the deliveries completely and you\u2019re not committed to taking that delivery in a future period. So it could be a mix of those two.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","","Hey. That\u2019s great. Thanks so much for the clarity. I really appreciate it.","Gale Klappa","","You\u2019re welcome. Good questions.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Bischof with Morningstar.","Gale Klappa","","Good afternoon, Andy.","Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","","Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my call.","Gale Klappa","","You\u2019re welcome. How are you doing today?","Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","","Good. How are you?","Gale Klappa","","We\u2019re well.","Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","","Just one remaining question. You kind of highlighted your distribution investments. If you can maybe provide some clarity on your discussions with state regulators and any insight on your ability to get pre-approval for those projects.","Gale Klappa","","Certainly. Let me first say that there is a what we call a CA process, the construction authority process that has been practiced by the Wisconsin Commission going back decades and decades. So if you have a distribution project that, I believe guys the number is $10 million, now they just raised it on the electric side. So let\u2019s just take electric as an example here. If you have a distribution project, capital project to improve or upgrade or rehab a part of the network that costs $10 million or more, you must seek authority and pre-approval from the Wisconsin Commission staff.","So we will have literally over the course of the next five years hundreds of these applications that will go the Wisconsin Commission staff and hundreds may be stretching it because it may not all individually come to $10 million, but we will have a significant number of these pre-approval requests. The requests are very thoroughly done. They document the rationale for why the upgrade is needed. And in our case, all of these relate to maintaining the reliability of the network and replacing aging infrastructure.","Let me give you just a couple of examples. Between now and 2016, we would plan to rebuild 2,500 miles of electric distribution lines that today are more than 50 years old. We would plan to replace about 28,000 power poles, about 28,000 transformers that are beyond their design life and literally hundreds of substation components and that\u2019s on the electric side of the business.","On the natural gas side of the business, again, between now and 2016, we would plan to replace 1,250 miles of fiberglass, plastic and steel gas mains. We would plan to replace about 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and almost a quarter of a million meter sets on the natural gas distribution side of the business. So that just gives you some flavor of the kinds of projects. Anything under $10 million, we would not necessarily seek pre-approval for, $10 million or above on the electric side, we would. And I might add that in the history of this Commission, if they pre-approve a project and you bring it in on time and on budget, they have never denied cost recovery.","Frederick Kuester","","While a lot of those project may not get pre-approval, they will be in our rate case that we file with our two-year forward-looking (inaudible).","Gale Klappa","","Exactly.","Frederick Kuester","","Window, so.","Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","","Okay. I appreciate that. And I\u2019m assuming they share your need of the distribution investments going forward?","Gale Klappa","","The they share our concerns?","Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","","Yes.","Gale Klappa","","Any time that you demonstrate a need to maintain reliability, it\u2019s generally well received. The Commission certainly understands the importance for a reliable network.","Andrew Bischof \u2013 Morningstar","","I appreciate the questions.","Gale Klappa","","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Gale Klappa","","Good afternoon, Paul.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","Good afternoon. First of all, what was the absolute fuel recovery as opposed to the year-over-year?","Gale Klappa","","Absolute fuel recovery I believe was $17.5 million.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","So last year, was it just about flat, neutral?","Gale Klappa","","I\u2019m sorry?","Gale Klappa","","Yeah.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","Last year was \u2013 you just about broke even on it.","Gale Klappa","","The first quarter was about level, about even.","Allen Leverett","","Right.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","And then second question is I think it\u2019s Presque Isle has transmission constraints that could be an opportunity.","Gale Klappa","","Yes, but the entire \u2013 and I\u2019ll let Allen give you the details but there is a northern plan that American Transmission Company has proposed. The northern third of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan have historically had weak transmission infrastructure. There\u2019s been some investment already. But clearly, when we look at the future, there is no question that there has to be additional transmission, particularly for, again, at the northern chunk of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to maintain reliability. Allen?","Allen Leverett","","Yeah. I think, Paul, Gale may have mentioned earlier that ATC\u2019s 10-year plan would call \u2013 within their footprint, which includes the UP of Michigan as well as Wisconsin, calls for $4 billion worth of capital spending. Roughly a quarter of that $4 billion is to address these issues that you and Gale were alluding to in the UP of Michigan.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","Is that \u2013 what\u2019s the sense of urgency? Is that something that could be taken up earlier?","Allen Leverett","","Well, certainly, stepping back, we have an issue right now, even with the Presque Isle facility there. So there\u2019s certainly a set of improvements that I think are quite urgent and should be pursued now. And ATC is seeking to get out-of-cycle review with MISO on those projects. I would say, Paul, roughly, that\u2019s probably $250 million worth of projects. It\u2019s that kind of zip code. But then the rest of them would be over a period of time.","Now, there are as you would expect, there are competing proposals, if you will. So I\u2019m sure that ITC would like to build some facilities up from the Lower Peninsula to the Upper Peninsula. So I mean there are competing proposals out there but there\u2019s some of this that really needs to be done in the short term even with the Presque Isle plant there.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","What do you define as short term?","Allen Leverett","","Well, if we get out-of-cycle review, I would say at latest they would get review by end of this year on those early stage projects. And then I would say if they got approval, Paul, those projects would probably be in place in the 2017 timeframe.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","Okay. And switching gears, you talk about $148 million amortization holiday, $37 million per quarter but O&M only improved $25 million. Is that $12 million delta what we can expect for the balance of the year kind of on a quarterly basis?","Gale Klappa","","No. Again, as Rick pointed out to you, when you\u2019re comparing quarter-to-quarter this year versus last year, we\u2019re going to see from the initiatives we have in place and from some of the projects that were one-time only projects in the fourth quarter of last year, you\u2019re going to see an improvement in that direction in the second half of the year. Rick?","Frederick Kuester","","Yeah. One thing that caused O&M to tick up a little bit is we \u2013 because of the warm weather, we\u2019ve got ahead on a number of our inspections, required inspections, in our regulated business side. And as I said earlier because of projects that we released at the end of last year, we\u2019re going to see improvement year-over-year I think in the second half of the year from an O&M standpoint.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","And then lastly, any update on the ash ponds spill?","Gale Klappa","","Well that is \u2013 in terms of the \u2013 are you talking about the Oak Creek bluff?","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","Yes.","Gale Klappa","","Okay. Yes. Really the response was very efficient, very quick. And if you had gone to the site, this happened on Halloween, October 31, 2011. If you had gone to the site one month later, you would never have known that anything occurred. So we are \u2013 the response again was great. 95% of the coal ash and dirt that fell down the bluff stayed on our property. There was no harm to the aquatic environment. No harm to the lake and so we\u2019re wrapping that up right now in discussions with the Department of Natural Resources and we would expect a full resolution certainly within the next few months.","Frederick Kuester","","And just one clarification. We don\u2019t have any wet ash ponds, Paul. This was ash that was stored or land filled in a ravine back in the 1950s and 1960s when it was entirely okay to do that. And so it was one pocket of ash that basically let loose. And as Gale said, we were able to clean it up with 95% of it being taken to a landfill.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","","Thanks for the clarification.","Gale Klappa","","Thank you.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin.","Gale Klappa","","Dan, I assume that you\u2019re following your normal pattern voting early and often.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","","Yeah, I am originally from Illinois.","Gale Klappa","","Yeah, well, be careful, you\u2019ll ruin your fingernails doing those license plates I understand. How are you doing, Dan?","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","","Fine. How about you?","Gale Klappa","","Yeah, we\u2019re fine. What can we do for you?","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","","I have a couple of questions. First, you talked a little bit about the increase in customer connections and I was wondering how that compared to say pre-recession levels. And also is there \u2013 do you have any sense of whether any of that was pulled forward because of the good weather in the first quarter as far as household formation and that kind of thing?","Gale Klappa","","Good questions, Dan. First of all how does this uptick that we\u2019re talking about compare to pre-recession levels. Still well below pre-recession levels. Probably less than half of pre-recession levels at this stage of the game, but encouraging.","And in your second question about did the warm spring weather pull forward these connections. Perhaps to some degree on electric side, however, the biggest percentage of increase was actually in natural gas connections. And there I think what we\u2019re benefiting from is the comparison of heating your home or your business today with natural gas compared for example to propane or oil. The cost differential has become very significant for customers.","So I don\u2019t think on the natural gas side with the 33% increase in natural gas connections over the past 12 months compared to the 12-months ended Q1 2011, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s weather. I think that\u2019s customers responding rationally to pricing. On the electric side, maybe some but again we\u2019re just beginning to see a little more stirring of economic activity. Not robust. Not back to where it was pre-recession, but encouraging.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","","How does what you saw compare to what you assumed in your plan for 2012? What was your assumption for customer connections?","Gale Klappa","","We don\u2019t have that number in the room with us. But it\u2019s definitely \u2013 we assumed \u2013 I think exactly the same level as last year.","Frederick Kuester","","Residential sales declined -","Gale Klappa","","And Rick\u2019s right, we assumed flat residential sales. So we didn\u2019t have much of anything in terms of an uptick in new customer connections compared to last year in our forecast.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","","Okay. And then you mentioned on the industrial side that you saw some gains in rubber and plastic area that were kind of the first time you\u2019ve seen that in a while. Perhaps you\u2019d give a little more color on what\u2019s driving that and do you expect it to continue going forward?","Gale Klappa","","Someone asked this morning whether that was automotive related and we don\u2019t have much of any automotive-related rubber and plastic business in our regions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s being driven by automotive. More color than that. Another thing it\u2019s a lot of individual companies all across the sector producing rubber and plastic products that have gone up.","Frederick Kuester","","Things like packaging.","Gale Klappa","","Yeah. We have a couple of large packaging manufacturers in our region and I know one of them had a pretty significant uptick in Q1.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","","Okay. And then the last thing I was wondering about is looking at the cash flow statement. There was a fairly big drop in the working capital, and I was wondering what\u2019s driving that difference between this year and last year and do you expect that to reverse going forward?","Gale Klappa","","We\u2019ll ask Steve Dickson, our Controller, to answer that for you.","Stephen Dickson I assume you\u2019re looking at the at the consolidated statement of cash flow and the line item working capital and other?","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","","Right.","Gale Klappa","Stephen Dickson Yeah, that declined about $139 million quarter-to-quarter. And as Rick mentioned on the call, there\u2019s a lot of really small items in there. One item is, if you remember last year in the first quarter, we received the settlement from the DOE and that increased the regulatory liabilities. So that flowed through as an increase in the cash from operations. Ironically, because we then be restricted it, it was a reduction in investing activities. But that was the largest item. That was about $40 million. Accrued interest was higher last year and that related to the debt that we repaid and there are a bunch of small items, but there is nothing really big other than those two items. Does that make sense?","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","","Okay. Sure. How about the reverse or do you expect that \u2013 so were those kind of one-time things than in 2011 that more than affected it then -?","Gale Klappa","Stephen Dickson Yeah, the big item, as I said, related to the restricted cash that we received in the DOE refund. That actually turns this year and it\u2019s a reduction of operating cash flow this year. So that item already reversed significantly in the first quarter. So I think last year, there were items, which helped us.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","","Okay. That\u2019s all I had. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","","Great. Thanks, Dan.","Operator","","Your next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Capital.","Gale Klappa","","Rock and roll, Vedula. How are you?","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital","","I\u2019m doing well, Gale. Thank you. Good afternoon.","Gale Klappa","","Good afternoon.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital","","Pretty much hit everything but when we were talking about ATC and we\u2019re talking about lumpiness and particularly in the backend when there\u2019ll be a lot more spending called out in 2016, 2017 or whatever. If I recall properly, I\u2019m just wondering whether the conglomeration of cooperatives, municipals and all the parties that make up ATC whether some of them may not be able to meet their capital calls whereby then you might be able to step in on the margin, be able to incrementally participate more in some of those opportunities in the backend. Do you foresee anything like that or does everybody look like really solid such that if these things happen, pretty much the current proportionality of your ownership versus all the other participants basically stay the same?","Gale Klappa","","Vedula, I think, and Allen can give you some more color as well. I think certainly the way the ATC formula works, when there is capital call, the owner certainly has a right to either meet that capital call or to decline to meet the capital call. And then if they decline to meet the capital call, as you\u2019re indicating, if the other parties then step in, they basically \u2013 the pro rata ownership percentages change.","Now, one thing to keep in mind and it\u2019s certainly possible that a coop or a municipality or a very tiny owner of ATC might or might not stand up to a capital call down the road but they have by and large very small percentages. Allen?","Allen Leverett","","Yeah. I guess maybe just looking at it in the limit, Vedula, I mean, if you look at all the sort of the say the not-for-profit entities and look at their total ownership, well, it\u2019s less than 10% of ATC. So it\u2019s certainly not a huge part of ATC. Based on the way they have all behaved in the past, they certainly made their capital calls in all but some very, very isolated incidents.","I think probably a bigger question on their participation going forward is not so much their participation in the inside of the footprint so that $4 billion worth of stuff that we talked about. It\u2019s not so much a question about whether they participate in those, in my mind, it\u2019s more of a question are they going to want to participate in some of these outside of the footprint types of project that ATC is trying to pursue with Duke. I mean, they\u2019re certainly entitled to if they want to help fund those and invest but I think there\u2019s probably a bigger question as to if they\u2019re going to want to do that.","Frederick Kuester","","The other dynamic that may change is ATC basically right now is largely self-funding and as the capital investment steps up, we might see a change there but that\u2019s again, that\u2019s in the second five-year half of our 10-year period.","Vedula Murti \u2013 CDP Capital","","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gale Klappa","","You\u2019re welcome, Vedula.","Gale Klappa","","Well, I believe that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any additional questions, our famous Colleen Henderson will be available in the Investor Relations office at 414-221-2592. Thank you very much. Have a good day everybody."],"21819":["Wisconsin Energy (NYSE:WEC) Q3 2013 Earnings Call October 30, 2013  2:00 PM ET","Executives","Gale E.

Thank you for waiting and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's Conference Call to review 2013 third quarter results. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions]","Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.","During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted a package of detailed financial information on its website at www.wisconsinenergy.com.","A replay of our remarks will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale E. Klappa","Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2013 third quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and President and CEO of We Generation; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer.","Pat, of course, will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings of $0.60 a share for the third quarter of 2013. This compares with earnings of $0.67 a share for the third quarter 2012. Our latest results reflect a return to normal summer weather compared to the record heat that we experienced last summer. On the positive side of the ledger, our earnings were boosted by a slight uptick in net income at We Power and by our share repurchase program. For the first 3 quarters of 2013, our earnings came in at $1.88 a share, compared to $1.92 a share for the first 9 months a year ago.","You'll recall that our year-to-date results this year reflect a $0.09 a share reduction for our customer bill credits. When our new biomass plant is complete and in commercial operation, we expect to add $0.09 a share to our fourth quarter earnings.","Turning now to the economy in our region. Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 6.7% in August and remains well below the national average. However, we anticipated some continued sluggishness in the regional economy when we projected our third quarter sales. And that sluggishness is truly reflected in our numbers.","Energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines in Michigan, were down by 3.5% compared to the third quarter a year ago. When you factor in normal weather, sales to our large commercial and industrial customers, again excluding the iron ore mines, were down by 2.7%.","We did see some positive signs though in September. Overall, electricity used by our large customer segment was higher than September of a year ago. And about half of the 17 industrial sectors that we track showed some positive growth in September.","Also, we're continuing to see customer growth across our system as well. Compared to the same time last year, new electric service installations are up by 2.7% and new natural gas installations have increased by 13.5%.","Now as many of you know, we are finishing up a major construction project, our biomass-fueled power plant in Rothschild, Wisconsin. Construction is now 97% complete and we're on-schedule for commercial operation before the end of the year. Since our last call, we recorded several significant milestones at Rothschild. We achieved first fire using natural gas on September 17. A week later, on September 24, we synchronized the steam turbine generator for the very first time. Also, we had our first fire using biomass on October 3. And we're continuing to test and fine-tune various systems on the unit in preparation for commercial operation.","As I've noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. The new unit will produce electricity for the grid and steam for the Domtar paper mill on the site. And we'll be able to dispatch the unit on-demand, the benefit of simply not available with solar or wind generation. Overall, our investment of the biomass plant is expected to total about $269 million and that's excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","In September, we also started a new construction project at one of our hydroelectric plants. We've officially began the work of building a new powerhouse at our Twin Falls hydroelectric site on the border of Wisconsin and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. Twin Falls is 1 of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. It was built back in 1912, and while the plant is licensed to operate until the year 2040, the existing powerhouse really needs repair. We considered several alternatives, but the most prudent course is to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. We received a Certificate of Authority for the project from the Wisconsin Commission in May.","Since our last update, we received all the necessary permits including a license amendment from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. We expect to complete the Twin Falls project in 2016, and we're estimating that the cost will be in the range of $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","You may recall that we're also planning to convert our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam to heat more than 450 buildings in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our distribution network.","We filed for construction authority with the Wisconsin Commission on April 26 and a Notice of Proceeding was issued by the commission in late June. If approved, we plan to complete the Valley conversion in late 2015 or early 2016 at an estimated cost of $65 million to $70 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","It's important to note that before we begin the conversion, we must also upgrade the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. That upgrade began in March of this year at an estimated cost of approximately $26 million.","Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain the same at 280 megawatts and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.","Switching gears now, you'll recall that in 2011, our board authorized us to repurchase up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock. That authorization runs through the end of this year. During the third quarter, we purchased approximately 1,147,000 shares. Since the program began, in total, we've repurchased 7,121,000 shares at a cost just under $254.8 million. That equates to an average purchase price of $35.78 a share.","Regarding our dividend policy, at our July board meeting, the board voted to accelerate to the second half of 2013 the dividend action that was planned for the first quarter of 2014. As a result, the directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.3825 on the company's common stock. This was an increase of $0.0425 a share in the quarterly dividend and it raised the annual rate from $1.36 a share to now $1.53 a share. The board also reaffirmed the dividend policy that calls for our payout ratio to rise to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a level that we believe will be much more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector.","And now I'd like to touch on our growth plan and on the investment opportunities that we see unfolding over the next several years.","You may recall that our capital budget calls for spending $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2013 through 2017. In this 5-year plan, we're shifting from the large high-profile projects that were part of Power the Future to many smaller scale projects designed to upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure.","Over the 5-year period, we'll place a greater focus on pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations, the building blocks of our delivery business. We've already begun rebuilding 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines, replacing 18,500 power poles, 20,000 transformers and literally hundreds of substation components.","On the natural gas distribution side of our business, we started to replace 1,250 miles of gas mains; 83,000 individual gas distribution lines; and approximately 233,000 meter sets.","The primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory and construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the megaprojects we've completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing the distribution networks is essential to maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest.","Turning now to Oak Creek. We continue to make progress on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you may recall, the units initially were permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous and Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal, blending the 2 types of coal could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the mix.","After receiving environmental approvals, we began testing a blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal of our Oak Creek expansion units in May. Testing has been progressing well and is expected to continue into 2015.","These tests will help us identify the equipment modifications that will be needed on a permanent basis to increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal in our fuel mix at Oak Creek. We expect to submit an application for a Certificate of Authority to the Wisconsin Commission in late 2014 or early 2015. Of course, we will need this approval to make the necessary modifications at the plant.","It's important to note that the investments we're planning on the generation side of our business, converting Valley to natural gas, changing our fuel mix at Oak Creek, are expected to lower costs for customers. The Valley conversion is projected to save up to $20 million a year in operating costs. And as I mentioned, our fuel flexibility efforts at Oak Creek could save customers up to $50 million a year, again, depending on the fuel mix.","On the natural gas distribution side of our business point, you may recall that we filed an application with the Wisconsin Commission in March to build a natural gas lateral in West Central Wisconsin. In August, we filed a supplement to provide additional information, primarily environmental data. The 85-mile line would run between Eau Claire County in the far western part of the state and the City of Tomah in Monroe County. The project will address reliability concerns in Western Wisconsin and meet growing demand, driven in part by customers continuing to convert from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in the region.","I might add that over the past few months, 8 communities along with the proposed route have passed resolutions authorizing us to begin operating natural gas distribution systems within their borders.","If approved by the Wisconsin Commission, we expect an in-service date for the new line during the fourth quarter of 2015. The projected cost is $150 million to $170 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","We're also continuing to follow another possible investment opportunity, the potential sale of the State of Wisconsin's electric and steam generating plants. On June 30, as you may recall, Governor Walker signed into law a new state budget that includes a provision expanding the State's authority to sell or lease certain state-owned properties. This means that the administration now has the authority to sell the State's electric, steam and chilled-water production and distribution facilities. The State is moving forward, and in early October, state officials began the process of selecting an outside financial advisor. No formal timetable has been announced but if the sale does take place, we expect that it would occur in late 2014 or early 2015.","And now before wrapping things up, I have a quick update for you on American Transmission Company. As you know, we're the second largest owner of ATC with an ownership stake of 26.2%. ATC recently published its 10-year capital investment plan for the years 2013 through 2022. The plan calls for a $3 billion to $3.6 billion of capital spending to bolster reliability and reduce congestion in the region. Now the previous 10-year plan have called for a higher level of investment in the range of $3.9 billion to $4.8 billion. However, we do not expect the new plan to have a major impact on our near-term earnings forecast because similar to the prior plan, much of the investment is back-end loaded.","I should also point out that the new 10-year plan from ATC only covers projects inside the franchise footprint in Wisconsin in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. ATC is also pursuing investments outside this footprint through a joint venture with the Duke Energy. The joint venture has proposed approximately $4 billion of new transmission in the broader Midwest and in the western part of the country. Any of these projects, if approved, would provide additional investment upside through ATC's 50% share on the joint venture.","Turning to Wisconsin rate matters, at the end of July, we filed our 2014 fuel case. We're asking the Wisconsin Commission for approval to reduce our fuel recovery rate next year by approximately $30 million. The primary driver of the savings is a reduction in the delivered cost of coal.","And finally, before closing my remarks, I'd like to update you on our Michigan operations. As you recall, under Michigan law, retail customers may choose an alternative supplier to provide power supply service. The law limits customer choice to 10% of Michigan's retail sales, but the law excludes from this cap the iron ore mines in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Of course, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions regardless of the power supplier.","As we reported to you on our last call, the 2 iron ore mines we were serving on an interruptible tariff switched to an alternative supplier on September 1. Several smaller retail customers have switched as well. We do not expect the loss of the mines or the smaller customers to have a material impact on our consolidated financial projections for 2013. We have taken and will continue to take multiple steps to mitigate the losses for 2014 and beyond.","For example, we filed a requested with MISO, of the Mid-continent Independent System Operator, to suspend operations of all 5 of our generating units at our Presque Isle Power Plant. In October, MISO informed us that all the units are necessary to maintain reliability in Northern Michigan. As a result, we are eligible for systems support resource payments from MISO to recover our costs for operating the units. We currently are working with MISO to determine the exact amounts of these payments and we expect to become eligible to receive the payments beginning in February of 2014.","Although the long-term impact of the Michigan choice law is still uncertain, we expect the successful mitigation efforts and a reasonable regulatory response should make our net financial exposure immaterial.","That said, given the loss of load in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, we need to reevaluate our supply portfolio. Before the departure of the mines, we had a long-term need for at least a portion of the Presque Isle Power Plant. At this point, we do not have that need. As a result, we're working with Wolverine Power Cooperative to modify the joint venture structure that we developed last year so that it works for both Wolverine and our customers over the long term.","And now, with more details on our third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2013, here's Pat.","James Patrick Keyes","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2013 third quarter earnings were $0.60 a share, compared to $0.67 a share for the same quarter in 2013. As expected, the results were slightly lower than last year because of a return to normal summer weather and customer bill credits related to our new biomass plant. Our consolidated operating income for the third quarter was $258 million as compared to $280.6 million in 2012, and that's a decrease of $22.6 million.","Starting with the utility energy segment. You'll see that operating income in the third quarter of 2013 totaled $166.6 million, a decrease of $24.4 million from the third quarter of 2012. The primary driver was the milder weather, which we estimate reduced our electric margins by $22.9 million. In addition, depreciation expense increased by $5.2 million, primarily because of the major environmental project that went into service last year.","As I've mentioned in previous earnings calls, we expect to receive a federal treasury grant related to our new biomass facility, which is scheduled to go into service by the end of the year. Our customers currently benefit from this grant through bill credits. However, accounting rules do not allow us to recognize the grant income until the plant is placed in service. We estimate that our third quarter earnings would have been $0.03 a share higher and our earnings for the first 9 months would have been $0.09 a share higher have we recorded the grant income to match the bill credits. Therefore, we expect to see a $0.09 pick up in the fourth quarter when we recognize the grant income after the biomass plant is placed into service.","Now turning to our nonutility segment. Operating income was up $1.7 million this quarter because of the final approval of our Power the Future plan cost in the last Wisconsin rate case. We expect this increase to continue in the fourth quarter.","Taking the changes for these 2 segments together and a slight improvement at corporate and other, you arrive at the $22.6 million decrease in operating income.","Earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $17.1 million in the third quarter and that's level with the same period in 2012.","Our other income, net, declined by $3.9 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased because we completed the final stages of the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units last year. In addition, our net interest expense increased by $1.1 million, primarily because of lower capitalized interest.","When compared to the third quarter 2012, our tax expense is down because of lower pretax income. We expect our effective tax rate for 2013 will be between 36% and 37%. Combining all of these items brings you to $137.5 million of net income for the third quarter 2013 or earnings of $0.60 per share.","During the first 9 months of 2013, our adjusted operating cash flows totaled $1,053,000,000, which is a $25 million increase from the same period in 2012. The increase largely came from cash received this year through customer rates for recovery of regulatory assets. In addition, during the first 9 months of 2013, we made no contributions to our benefits plan compared to $100 million contribution made in the same timeframe in 2012.","This increase was partially offset by a $33 million decrease in restricted cash related to a customer refund in 2012 of a settlement with the Department of Energy.","Our total capital expenditures increased by $20 million in the first 9 months of 2013 compared to 2012, primarily because of investments in our distribution infrastructure.","We paid $242.3 million in common dividends in the first 9 months of 2013, an increase of $34.9 million or almost 17% over the first 9 months of 2012. Our 2013 dividend includes 2 increases: The first in March, and then again in September. Our current quarterly dividend rate is $0.3825 per share.","Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52% at the end of September. Our calculation creates half of our hybrid security as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. The projected year-end debt-to-total capital is expected to be relatively flat with 2012 year end. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. So going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","As shown in the earnings package on our website, retail sales of electricity, excluding the mines, decreased by 2.9% in the first 9 months of 2013 as compared to the first 9 months of 2012. Our normalized sales were down by 0.8%. All normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of leap year and weather.","Looking at the individual customer segments, actual residential sales for the first 9 months of the year we're down 3.9% because of a return to normal summer weather. On a normalized basis, sales we're down 0.2%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, sales for the first 9 months were down 1.1%. On a normalized basis, sales to small commercial and industrial customers were down 0.6%. And on a normalized basis, sales for the first 9 months of 2013 in the large commercial industrial segment, again excluding the iron ore mines, were down 1.8%.","On the natural gas distribution side of the business, total volumes during the first 9 months of the year, excluding the volumes used in power generation, increased by 20.9%, primarily due to colder winter weather. On a normalized basis, gas volumes for the first 9 months of the year rose 2% as compared to 2012. This growth is the result of an increase in customers, fuel switching to natural gas and the positive impact of additional gas used in the sand mining industry. Overall, these gas volumes we're better than our projections.","Finally, as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, we are tightening our annual earnings guidance. Our prior guidance was $2.41 to $2.48 a share. Our new guidance is $2.43 to $2.48 a share. Again, our new guidance for 2013 is $2.43 to $2.48 a share. This reflects our strong performance through the first 9 months of the year, assumes normal weather, takes into consideration the effects of the Michigan choice law and recognizes the grant income associated with the biomass plant.","And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa","Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","So first question here, just with regards to the Wolverine and Presque Isle and all that, what are you guys trying to get out there? I mean, is this ultimately shut down or is this a sale or something in between?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, we'll ask Allen to give you some detail, but let me just kind of frame this for you again, because you're asking an important question. A year ago, we truly believed, looking at our demand projections and looking at the demand in the Upper Peninsula, that we had a need for a portion, at least the portion of the Presque Isle 5 unit facility. However, that plant is going to need environmental upgrades. And Allen and his folks worked very hard with Wolverine Power Cooperative to put together, what I thought was a very elegant solution, which was Wolverine would fund completely the cost of the environmental upgrades in return for a pro rata ownership of the plant, roughly 1\/3. That really, we thought, fit both Wolverine's need and our need going forward. But now with the loss of the mines, we simply don't have retail customers to support basically our continued cost of the plant. So we're looking at each one of the paths. We obviously, in the interim, are being told we have to run the plant and now we're eligible for the system support resource payments from MISO. But in the longer-term, really, we're looking at all the alternatives and Allen can give you some detail.","Allen L. Leverett","Yes, and I would say probably long term, Julien, I think from a practical standpoint, there are probably only 2 likely paths. One path is I'll call it some renegotiated version of the joint venture agreement. So perhaps instead of having 5 units at the plant, maybe only have 3 units. So perhaps you downsize it, perhaps Wolverine maybe and some other entity own those -- the smaller plant. So, I mean that's one potential path. I would say the other potential path is, there's just the dissolution basically of the joint venture agreement we have now. We run the unit. As Gale mentioned, we run the units as long as they are required by MISO, and MISO is making those SSR payments and then, once the units are no longer needed, well, they'd be retired. So I think from a practical standpoint, that those are really the only 2 paths. It's hard for me to imagine a path where the joint venture agreement, as currently structured, that we can continue with that, because as Gale mentioned, we've had such a change in our demand as a company. So hopefully that helps some.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Absolutely. And just curious, if you don't mind following up on, what does this mean for customers rates, just at the end of the day in the UP?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, we can both take a shot at that. In terms of the customer rates and the UP, I mean backing up, if the plant is going to continue to operate for the longer term, someone has to cover the cost of the operation. And our view would be that I mean customer rates in the UP probably would continue to go up some because either way, our customers in Michigan would have to support -- if the plant were to run for the long term, customer rates would have to support the environmental upgrades and the ongoing production costs and fixed production costs of the plant. I think everyone is aware of that. There's a lot of discussion going on. Clear, the governor's office would very much like, in Michigan, the plant to stay open. They really believe there is future economic growth there and particularly in terms of the mining industry. So lots of discussions going on right now, and I would guess that the picture would become much clearer certainly over the course of the next few months.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Got you. And then maybe following up on some comments from some of your peers today. Just trying to get a sense, longer-term, how do you see your earnings growth rate trending here? I mean just given the sort of availability of investment opportunities, I'm curious as you balance ATC and others, are we seeing a consistent trend here or is there some slowing in their future, just to throw it out there.","Gale E. Klappa","Well, we're in the process now, Julien, of completing our next rolling 5-year capital spending plan. But from everything I'm seeing, I mean we have said, as you know, that our medium-term growth looks like 4% to 6% off our 2011 base. And right now, I would say that, that stands in terms of as good a projection as we can divine by looking into the future. And remember, we have, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have a significant amount of investment that needs to be made in our delivery networks, in upgrading our aging infrastructure. So about 2\/3 of the capital spending that we've identified for 2013 through 2017, is really being devoted to upgrading the reliability of our distribution networks and that is work that needs to continue. So I would say, the best range can give you at the moment is 4% to 6% EPS growth.","Operator","Kit Konolige with BGC Financial please state your question.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Let me, Gale, just follow up on your discussion just now regarding earnings growth. So in order to get earnings growth with -- well, let me ask this. What kind of sales growth do you see feeding into that earnings growth over the next whatever it is, 3 to 5 years?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, Kit, as you know, we've been, I think, appropriately conservative in our sales growth projections. I believe, when we are all together last year at the EEI Conference in November, I think we were the only major company projecting literally no growth in kilowatt hour sales for 2013. I mean, as it's turning out, that projection was pretty much on target.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","You were the only ones right.","Gale E. Klappa","Yes. Sometimes we get lucky. But long story short, as we're putting our rolling 5-year plan together and updating it, I think you're going to see sales growth projections on the electric side in the 0.3% to 0.5% growth range. That's currently what we're focusing on and we're now completing, as we do every year, interviews with our 120 largest industrial customers to get their input on the demand that they see over the next year. So we'll refine all of that, but I think right now, you can expect in our new 5-year plan, to see about 0.3% to 0.5% annual weather normal increase in electric sales.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","So that relatively low level of load growth would suggest that you'll need some -- and relatively high level of capital spending would imply that you'd need some significant rate relief over that period.","Gale E. Klappa","Well, certainly some rate release, but I think more in the lines of historic inflation over time and let me explain why. Yes, the sales growth projections are moderate to low. I think appropriate but moderate to low. But we're also making significant amount of investments on the capital you referred to, that will help us take out operation and maintenance costs. And we mentioned a couple of them in the prepared remarks.","For example, our proposal to convert our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas, we expect that will take out roughly $20 million a year in operating costs. The concept of fuel flexibility that we're testing out at our new Oak Creek units, that $25 million to $50 million of fuel cost savings. Pat, our IT group also reports up through Pat and we have a whole list of very significant IT capital projects designed to take out operation and maintenance costs and make our processes more efficient. So we think we can modify and reduce what otherwise would be a larger rate increase request simply by wisely spending capital that makes us more efficient and takes out O&M. And I think that would be another lever that you will see us employ over the course of the next 5 to 7 years.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","All right. Great. And then a separate area on the ATC and the Duke joint ventures. Is the Duke JV in particular, what do you realistically see as the likelihood of some of those $4 billion in proposed projects coming to fruition?","Gale E. Klappa","Let me say first, I'm going to ask Allen because he sits on the board of ATC, to give you a specific answer. But to frame that answer for you, Kit, we have always been, as you know, reasonably conservative in terms of what we put into our financial model. We're not going overpromise and underdeliver. And so we've been quite conservative in terms of taking the ATC plan and shaping it to what we think is a conservative estimate of what may happen. And many of those projects as you know, just because of the nature of large transmission projects, are back-end loaded in the financial model. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett","Yes, and Kit, I mean, maybe just picking up on that. Gale, certainly in the script, addressed the first 5 years. What I mean by that is the impact of the revised ATC outlook on the first 5 years of our financial projections, and as he said, really no impact on that first 5 years. So let me maybe address kind of the period beyond the first 5 years. When we develop longer-term projections and we look at the outlook from ATC for inside the footprint, we really use, what I would, call a midrange case. I mean, we don't take the most conservative nor do we take the highest case. We sort of take kind of a midrange case for inside the footprint. However, outside the footprint, we use a low-range case meaning a much more conservative outlook on what ATC might be able to invest.","So as we look at, if ATC can do better than that low-range case outside the footprint, it's already, reasonably speaking, a low bar, we'd be optimistic that on a net basis, we could be right back to kind of the 10-year outlook that they had before and possibly even have a little upside above that. And certainly, with the outlook, it would still be supportive of the 4% to 6% EPS growth target that Gale mentioned earlier to Julien's question. So hopefully that helps a little bit, Kit.","Operator","Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Just curious, do you have a depreciated book value for the Presque Isle Plant?","Gale E. Klappa","Yes. Right at about $219 million.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And what were the primary drivers of the lower, revised CapEx at ATC? What was driving that?","Gale E. Klappa","Allen?","Allen L. Leverett","Yes. And then, I would sort of put it in 2 or possibly 3 categories. Far and away, the biggest driver, ATC had put forward a plan for addressing transmission issues in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. And in the new plan, the size of those investments is less than in the old plan. So that's kind of the first area, if you will, that was causing a difference.","The second thing that was causing a difference, as I'm sure you're aware, the Kewaunee Nuclear Plant here in Wisconsin is now shut down. So it's shut down. They were going to be some transmission improvements that would've been required if it had continued to operate. Those are no longer going to be required or at least the level that are going to be required are now much less because of the Kewaunee Plant is not going to operate over the long-term.","And then finally, there were 2 345 kV projects. One, that's sort of a -- more of an east-west line that went from Wisconsin over to Minnesota; another line, more north-south, that went from Wisconsin down into Iowa. In the previous outlook, ATC had projected that they would be able to invest the capital for the entire length of both of those lines. And as it turned out, they're only able to invest roughly half of the investment required in each of the lines. So Xcel will get half of that east-west line that I mentioned, and ITC will get half of that north-south line that I mentioned. But at a high level, those are the 3 major drivers, if you will, of the change in their outlook.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. My last question, I'm just curious, you reported $0.60 and that was above the quarterly guidance of $0.52 to $0.56 you conveyed in August. So I was just curious what enabled you to beat your budget.","Gale E. Klappa","What allowed us to beat the budget?","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Yes.","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I think a couple of things. First of all, really good solid operation and maintenance cost control from our folks. And then on weather normal basis, we were projecting weather normal but we did a little bit better, I believe, particularly in September on energy sales than we had projected.","Operator","Andy Bischof with Morningstar, please state your question.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Really quick question for you guys this afternoon. In Michigan, you mentioned you'd be eligible for systems support payments in February. When would you expect to know the details of that support?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I would hope we'll know the details of that support by the end of the year, certainly by early January because the process that MISO goes through -- and first of all, now that they've determined that we are eligible for the payments, the next step is we and they sit down with a detailed analysis of the operating costs, of the potential capital costs over the course of the next few years, and then we and they agree on a level of payment. That whole agreement, then, is subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. And once submitted, Allen, I believe the FERC has 60 days to respond.","Allen L. Leverett","That's right.","Gale E. Klappa","So we would hope to have all those discussions wrapped up with MISO by the end of the year, and a filing to FERC very early in the new year.","Operator","Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets, please state your question.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Your former coworkers went into extra innings so I missed if you gave them the potential capital opportunities at Oak Valley and Valley -- Oak Creek and Valley.","Gale E. Klappa","We talked about fuel flexibility at Oak Creek. At Valley, we did talk about the potential capital opportunity, $65 million to $70 million. We're in the approval process right now with the Wisconsin Commission. That process is moving along as expected. And then in addition, if you remember, we said to convert Valley from coal to natural gas, $65 million to $70 million capital investment. But in addition to that, we need to complete an upgrade of the natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. That work has been approved and is actually underway, began in March and our expected total cost of that would be about $26 million, in addition to the $65 million to $70 million related to the Valley conversion.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So Oak Creek is really just material handling, not so much capital?","Allen L. Leverett","Well, it could be capital, Paul. And we really need to get through the testing phase with the burning the blends of sub-bituminous and bituminous coal. And depending on the results of that, you could get, reasonably speaking, a wide range of potential capital investment opportunities. I mean, if you had to do -- if you're able to do what the engineers call in-furnace blending, that might be something on the order of $20 million to $25 million of capital. If you're not able to do that reliably, you might have to do -- you might have to actually have a blending facility and that could be upwards of $100 million. But we're just not really going to know where we are on that continuum of solutions until we finished the testing.","Gale E. Klappa","And we did say that we would -- assuming the testing continues to give us positive results, that we would file a -- for construction authority with the Wisconsin Commission late '14 or early '15.","Allen L. Leverett","Correct.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then how would SSR payments compare to the return you're currently earning? Or not earning?","Gale E. Klappa","That's a good question. Well, we really need to work through all of this with MISO, but let me just kind of break this into a couple of categories for you. If you think about the cost we incurred to operate the plant, well, there are fuel costs. Well, those fuel costs are, by and large, recovered through the hourly energy market. So the fuel cost we should be getting full recovery for.","There's what we call variable O&M, the additional costs reproducing the incremental kilowatt hour. The variable O&M also should be recovered through the hourly energy market.","Then we have fixed production costs. So the fixed cost of operating the facility, the staffing, the normal O&M, the maintenance, et cetera, et cetera, and our guesstimate there is, not only guesstimate but that's part of what SSR payments are supposed to cover. So to put it all into perspective, if nothing -- if we did nothing, the margin hit pretax would be, Allen, $50 million to $54 million?","Allen L. Leverett","Right.","Gale E. Klappa","However, in our discussions with MISO, we're in the range now of $35 million to $82 million, depending upon how much of the capital that we might spend over the next several years to keep the unit reliable, how much of that capital MISO is willing to cover. But I think by definition, the MISO SSR payments are designed to, at a minimum, compensate you for the fixed production costs.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Does -- did Michigan energy legislation contemplate what would happen if [indiscernible] stranded asset?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I think originally it did. However, if you recall the 2008 amendment to the Michigan choice law, many believe that stranded costs were not recoverable after the amendment to that law. And I believe that basically, the law said that anyone who is getting -- any utility getting stranded costs that the commission had to make sure those stranded costs were recovered and completely recovered through billing by October of this year. Right? The position of the Michigan commission is that under that law, future stranded costs are not recoverable.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And then just lastly, any forward look on the impact of discount rates on your pension?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I'll ask Pat to give you a more specific answer, but right now, I mean, going into this year and through where we stand today, we are virtually fully funded on our pension plan. We have not made any cash contribution to the pension plan this year, simply hasn't been needed. I think we're, I think, one of the few companies in our industry that is in really very good shape related to pension funding and funding up our obligations under the plan. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes","Yes, Gale. I'm not sure I have too much more to add to that. We're certainly running the miles with our actuaries and we are, as Gale mentioned, about 100% funded now. Given where we are in returns, where we anticipate the discount rate will end up, we're going to end up about 100% funded by the end of the year is our -- more or less without having any material contribution.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","So you could be at a position to have pension earnings next year?","Gale E. Klappa","I don't think we're really projecting any pension earnings next year.","Operator","Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs, please state your question.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Easy question for you. Next year is a rate case year?","Gale E. Klappa","Yes.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","How are you thinking about relative to maybe some of you priority rate cases? How material this one is for Wisconsin Energy? How much material this one is for your ratepayers? What are going to be some of the more important issues that, when you file this in the spring, investors should monitor?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, very good question, Michael. Let me talk with you about kind of maybe 3 elements. I mean, first of all, where I believe, and if our projections continue to hold, I think we'll have some good news on fuel. So we should be able to, I mean, as I mentioned in our script, this would not be for 2015 but for 2014, we filed for approval to reduce our fuel recovery rate by $30 million. And if fuel prices stay low, we should get -- we should be neutral to maybe positive, I hope, in terms of fuel cost recoveries. So that should be helpful on the rate case front for 2015 and beyond.","The second piece clearly will be, we need to recover projects, capital projects that have basically already been approved. Remember, we talked about the capital investments we're making in deliver the future. The basic upgrades that we're making to our distribution networks, that capital that we spent, with blessing from the commission in the prior rate case, will need to be recovered in rates starting in 2015. So that will be one of the big drivers.","So I think fuel will be a help. One of the big drivers will be -- will clearly be the deliver the future capital. And then there'd be a couple of other factors that will swing one way or another but we're hoping that this will be a moderate rate case and we don't see any sticker shock coming down the road here.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Meaning you see something that's in the low- to mid-single-digit-increase level and not a dramatically bigger number than that?","Gale E. Klappa","That is certainly our goal and that's what we believe we will be filing for, yes.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Last item, Presque Isle, I want to make sure I follow this correctly. If it's $219 million in book and if it were still included in rate base kind of -- I'm going to do back-of-the-envelope math, 50\/50 GAAP structure, 10% ROE, you're talking $10 million to $15 million, $10 million to $12 million of authorized net income in book. Is there any scenario where the MISO payments actually give you a greater bottom line contribution than what you would get under just traditional rate, regulatory rate making?","Gale E. Klappa","Michael, they're not -- the MISO payments are not designed to give you any kind of a greater return. I would point out that I think it's just important keep in the back of your mind, the book value of the Presque Isle Plant is still included in rate base.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So in other words, any rate, any SSR from the MISO is basically serving as a substitute for what regulated rates otherwise would've already included had you not made the decision -- had your retirement decision kind of -- had you retired the unit?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, not exactly but I would look at it this way. Instead of the mines, the SSR payments from MISO, in essence, instead of the mines being a customer, MISO is being a customer but MISO is not necessarily going to pay you the return. MISO will keep you whole on the operating cost and, perhaps, some capital.","Operator","Jon Arnold with Deutsche Bank, please state your question.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","So quickly on the buyback. Did I hear you right that you've done $255-odd million?","Gale E. Klappa","Yes. $254.8 million, to put a fine point on it.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay. So if you do more or less the same in the fourth quarter that you did in the third, you will basically consume the $300 million through the end of 2013. What's the time frame for potentially re-upping that?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, we have our normal meeting with our Board of Directors in December where we go through our 5-year plan, our 5-year capital spending plan, our 5-year projections on kilowatt hour sales growth, our 5-year projections on our capital structure. And it will be at that time, as we walk them through and get approval for our 5-year plan, it will be at that time when we will ask them for any changes, if any are warranted, in the share buyback authorization.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank AG, Research Division","Okay, so if you were to tell, that would be a sort of fourth quarter earnings timing if there was a change?","Gale E. Klappa","That is correct.","Operator","Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates, please state your question.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Just wanted to touch base on a few quick things. One was, Kit was asking about sales growth and I think you guys mentioned that you guys saw 2013 as being flat. And to date, it's been about negative 0.8% or close to negative 1%. What...","Gale E. Klappa","Yes, negative 0.8%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","0.8%. Do you guys see a big increase this -- is there some timing issue? What's going to end up going to happen in the fourth quarter to bring it up? Or could you just elaborate a little bit on that?","Gale E. Klappa","No. We're actually running a little bit lower than our projections on the electric sales side of the business. Now I will say last fourth quarter, meaning the fourth quarter of 2012, the weather was mild. So on a weather-normal basis, you might see some bit of a small bit of an uptick on the electric side.","On the other side of the ledger though, we are seeing a little stronger natural gas sales, and I mentioned this in the prepared remarks, than we had anticipated. If you just look at actuals, we're up almost 20% in terms of natural gas deliveries over the first 9 months of the year ago, but we had a cold winter in the first quarter, kind of going on into April and May. So on a weather-normal basis, we're up about 2% and we had not projected that kind of growth on the natural gas side. So there have been some compensating offsets here.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But on the electric side, it might be a little bit down, I guess, for 2013 versus last year?","Gale E. Klappa","On a weather-normal basis, I would expect a little bit down now for the calendar year. You are correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And then for the 3% to 5% that you mentioned, that was for several years out, is that correct?","Gale E. Klappa","0.3% to 0.5%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","That's what I meant. Sorry. Boy, that would be a big difference, wouldn't it? What's the period of time we're talking about over -- sorry, if I missed. What's that over that -- how many years is that over?","Gale E. Klappa","That would a rolling 5 years, so '14 to '18.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, and then in terms of the rate case year and the impact on customers, you mentioned that there was a fuel decrease. And is that what was -- is that fuel decrease factored into what you expect to be that sort of mid-single digit that, I think, you guys were discussing?","Gale E. Klappa","No, and I apologized if I confused someone. The fuel decrease, the $30 million fuel decrease, we have just filed for that and would expect the commission to approve a fuel decrease in 2014. And what I was really saying is that if fuel prices stay low and delivered cost of coal stays low and goes down a hair, we might get some help for that -- we might get some help from that in our in our filing for 2015 rates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just back to electric sales growth and what you're seeing there. What kind of GDP forecast are you guys looking at for those 5 years when you're coming up with that sort of 0.3% to 0.5%?","Gale E. Klappa","I'm looking at Scott Lauber, our Treasurer, here. But the way we -- what we do in essence, we kind of back in to a GDP. We really do this bottoms up. We really look at customer segment by customer segment. We look at the growth in that segment or lack thereof. So we don't start with an overarching GDP forecast. But if I had to guess, seeing what we've seen so far, we're kind honing in on a 0.3% to 0.5% annual kilowatt hour sales growth. If I had to guess, that would be, and I'm guessing, about 1.5%, 2% GDP growth.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then just finally, given the power price, the wholesale power price situation in MISO and given the transmission projects that we've seen being discussed and potentially may come about with respect to cross-border PJM versus MISO, congestion relief, the Seams issue, if you follow me?","Gale E. Klappa","Yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Do you guys see more opportunities to sell into higher-priced markets given sort of the dynamics that you guys have there? I mean, I know it doesn't make a big bottom-line impact to you guys but I do know that you're also sort of looking to provide relief to try to help out customers as much as possible in terms of off-systems sales. Just wondering any thoughts sort of directionally about that or...","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I will be happy to give you my thought. Allen, who is very familiar with these issues as well, I'd be happy to have Allen pitching his thoughts. I don't think near-term, certainly in the next 12 months, I wouldn't see any kind of major swing or major impact. However, if you look -- having said that, and again, I should remind everyone, energy sales for our -- sales into the MISO market over and above what our customers need, the revenue above cost from those sales go back to, as you pointed out, go back to reduced fuel costs for our customers. So that margin, the difference between our revenue that we would get in the hourly energy market and our cost to producing that, that goes back to help customers.","Now if you look at one of our line items on our statements, you'll see a big increase so far in the first 9 months of this year in our off-system sales. That's because, already, we're seeing our Oak Creek units, our brand-new Oak Creek units, dispatched more often by MISO because of their fundamental efficiency. And we've had great availability at our Oak Creek units, our new Oak Creek units this year. So even without any change in the Seams Agreements, even without any additional congestion relief between MISO and PJM, we're starting to see the benefits for our customers of the higher off-systems sales into the MISO market point given the fundamental efficiency of those Oak Creek units. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett","Yes. I guess, the only thing I would add, and maybe just picking on the fundamental efficiency point that Gale was making. I mean, when you look at the collection of units that we have from a thermal-efficiency standpoint, in the case of the new Oak Creek units, one of the most efficient units in the country, the last data set I saw, Paul, it was in the top 10 for steam units in the United States. And if you certainly look within MISO at our other units and how competitive those are, we believe those are, if not in the top decile, in the next to the top decile in terms of efficiency. So I would say, particularly if you got a higher-natural-gas-price environment, we would be very well positioned to bring some margin back for our customers, not for the owners, but certainly for our customers and that will be a wonderful thing.","Gale E. Klappa","So Paul, maybe we can get 5% energy sales growth after all.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, I mean, I just was wondering do you see any congestion relief between MISO and PJM? Or is that just something that's too far into the future for you guys at all. I mean, it's like you said, it isn't a bottom line impact. I was just wondering since you guys are significant in the market, and we're also talking about wind increasing in MISO as well, just sort of...","Gale E. Klappa","Yes.","Allen L. Leverett","Right. Well, at this point, I don't see a lot of congestion relief between the 2 ISOs, between PJM and MISO. But what we are seeing some diminution in the congestion sort of going south through our system, which I guess, ultimately, you don't have to go too far south to get to PJM. So hopefully, we'll will see some.","Gale E. Klappa","Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you, again, for participating. If you have any other questions, the famous Colleen Henderson will be available in our Investor Relations Office and her direct line is (414) 221-2592.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you all that statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our 2018 third quarter results.","But first, a quick personnel update. As we announced earlier this month, Allen Leverett, who has been on medical leave since suffering a stroke last October, has resigned from active duty with the company. Allen will continue to serve on our Board of Directors, and I'm delighted that Allen will continue to bring his insight and his experience to our deliberations.","In light of Allen's decision to resign, our board has elected Kevin Fletcher as the new President of WEC Energy Group. Kevin has more than 40 years of experience in the energy industry, most recently as President of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service, our largest subsidiaries. His main focus will be on the operating and financial performance of our seven customer-facing utilities and he will report directly to me. I have had the privilege of knowing and working with Kevin for the past 25 years. With his experience in engineering, operations, customer service, and economic development, and of course, a strong focus on financial discipline, Kevin will provide great continuity for our organization going forward. For those of you who haven't met Kevin, he will be on hand with us at the EEI meetings in San Francisco and we're both looking forward to seeing you there.","And now I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have: Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Bill Guc, our Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Now as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.74 a share. This compared to $0.68 a share for the third quarter last year. Our strong performance was principally driven by three factors: first, higher demand for electricity and natural gas, reflecting a robust economy across the region; warmer-than-normal summer temperatures; and our continued focus on efficiency and cost control throughout our operations. Scott will provide you with more details on the quarter in just a few minutes. But first, let's take a brief look at the economic conditions right here in the heartland.","Wisconsin's unemployment rate has been at 3% or lower for the past eight months; that's the longest stretch of near-full employment in state history. The state has also witnessed significant growth in the manufacturing sector in the past year and I believe there are even greater opportunities ahead. For example, in late September, Komatsu Mining announced plans for a new development here in Milwaukee. Komatsu, as many of you know, a global leader in heavy construction and mining equipment, has agreed to develop 43 acres for a state-of-the-art manufacturing facility and a new corporate office. Komatsu will invest $300 million in the project, which will have a defining impact on Milwaukee's Harbor District. Site is expected to be eventually housing more than 1,000 workers.","And looking just south of Milwaukee, four months have now passed since Foxconn's official groundbreaking for the Wisconn Valley Science and Technology Park. In that time, a tremendous amount of progress has been made on this $10 billion high-tech manufacturing campus. Every day now brings an average of 400 workers to the site, about 3.5 million cubic yards of soil have been excavated and work has begun on the first building. The wall panels for that building were designed and assembled right here in Wisconsin.","And to-date, more than 90% of all the contracts for the Foxconn development have been awarded to Wisconsin-based companies. As some of you may know, Foxconn is also planning to expand its reach in Wisconsin with innovation centers in Milwaukee, Green Bay, Eau Claire and Racine. We're just beginning folks to see the tremendous catalytic effect of Foxconn's investment plans for the region.","And next, I'd like to touch on our WEC Energy growth plan and the investment opportunities we see unfolding over the next several years. You may recall that our capital budget, which includes our share of American Transmission's capital spending, was $13.4 billion for the five-year period 2018 through 2022. Today, we're announcing an updated five-year capital forecast for the years 2019 through 2023. Our new capital investment plan stands at $14.1 billion, an increase of $700 million over the previous five-year plan. We look forward to sharing all the details of our $14.1 billion plan with you at the upcoming EEI conference.","You may have seen though from our earnings packet that we released this morning, we have growing opportunities in our natural gas delivery and energy infrastructure segments. Overall, I would say that our investment plan is exactly what you would expect it to be: solid low-risk projects, highly executable with no big bets. Today, we're also reaffirming our long-term earnings growth rate of 5% to 7%. And we are updating the base for that growth rate. The new base is $3.28 a share. That's the midpoint of our original guidance for 2018. So, folks when you put all the pieces together, our new capital plan should support an earnings per share growth rate in the low 6% range.","Switching gears now to our current capital projects. We're making real progress across-the-board on our electric and gas network upgrades, our generation projects and on our non-utility infrastructure segment. As you'll recall in late June, we announced an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center. That's located in Henry County, Illinois. We received approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on August 29. And two days later, we closed on the acquisition.","Then in early October, we took advantage of an opportunity to increase our equity interest by an additional 10%. Pending FERC approval, we will have a 90% ownership interest in this wind farm. As a reminder, this wind facility was developed by Invenergy and was placed into service this past May. It consists of 53 General Electric turbines with a capacity of 132 megawatts. In total, our investment is expected to be $166 million. The project has a long-term 22-year offtake agreement with one of our current wholesale customers, WPPI Energy, so this investment is really a logical extension of our core wholesale power business.","And now for a brief update on our planned investment in the Upstream Wind Energy Center. On June 15, we filed with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval to purchase an 80% ownership interest in the Upstream project. This wind farm is located in Antelope County, Nebraska. It consists of 81 GE wind turbines with a capacity of approximately 200 megawatts. Our purchase price is expected to be $280 million. And again, that purchase price, the $280 million, is reflected in our infrastructure segment in our new five-year plan. The project has a long-term 10-year offtake agreement with an affiliate of Allianz, which is an A-rated publicly traded company. We expect to close on the purchase in early 2019 after construction is complete.","Under the new tax rules, our original investments in these two wind farms qualify for production tax credits and 100% bonus depreciation. We expect the return on these investments to be higher than our regulated returns. Specifically, we're projecting an unlevered internal rate of return above 8% or in the mid-teens on a levered basis. And we're projecting returns on equity based on a 50:50 capital structure at or above our retail returns.","We're also making progress on our quest to add utility-scale solar generation to our portfolio of regulated assets. To refresh your memory, on May 31, our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary, along with Madison Gas and Electric, filed a joint application with the Wisconsin Commission to purchase 300 megawatts of solar generation at two locations. The Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in southwestern Wisconsin, in Iowa County. It will be developed by Invenergy. The Two Creeks project will be located in the city of Two Rivers in Northeastern Wisconsin near the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant. The Two Creeks project is being developed by NextEra.","Our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary will own 100 megawatts at each site, with an investment of approximately $260 million. Pending regulatory approvals, we expect construction for both projects to begin next spring, with commercial operation by the end of 2020.","Over the past few years, utility-scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices have dropped by nearly 70%, making it a cost-effective option for our customers, an option that also fits well with our summer peak demand curve and with our plan to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. Our investments in zero-carbon generation will support our aggressive long-term goal to reduce CO2 emissions by 80% below 2005 levels by the year 2050.","Turning now to Illinois, as I've said before, the Peoples Gas system modernization program is critical, providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe, and reliable. We're on track to invest approximately $270 million in the effort this year. The overall project is now approximately 26% complete.","And now a word about our Minnesota utility, in October of last year, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Public Utilities Commission. Interim rates are currently in place, and hearings in the case were held in mid-July. We expect the commission decision by year-end.","Next, we'll turn to Michigan. As a reminder, we obtained final regulatory approval last October for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. Engineering and procurement are essentially complete now, and construction stands at 65% complete. Our plan is to bring the new units into commercial service in the second quarter of 2019. And at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle.","We're investing $266 million in 10 reciprocating internal combustion engines, or as we call them, RICE units. They're capable of generating a total of 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by one of our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost-effective long-term power supply for customers in the Upper Peninsula. And you can say it with me, we're on time and on budget.","And finally, a reminder about our dividend. At our January meeting this past winter, the Board of Directors raised the quarterly cash dividend to $0.5525 per share. That's an increase of 6.25% over the previous dividend rate. And as is typical, our board will assess our dividend plans for 2019 coming up in December.","And now with details on our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2018, here's our Chief Financial Officer, the famous Scott Lauber.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Gale.","Our 2018 third quarter earnings of $0.74 per share were $0.06 per share higher than the third quarter of 2017. These favorable results were largely driven by higher sales volumes and continued effective cost control. Warmer than normal summer temperatures coupled with strong growth in the region drove electricity use above our forecasts.","The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter and year-to-date results for 2018 and 2017. My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense, and income taxes.","Referring to page 9 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the third quarter of 2018 was $303 million compared to $392 million during the third quarter of 2017, a decrease of $89 million. Excluding two tax items totaling $93 million, operating income actually increased $4 million. As previously discussed on the last two calls, the first tax item reflects the benefit of tax repairs, which was part of our 2017 Wisconsin rate settlement. And the second item relates to the federal tax legislation. We have a breakout of these items for your reference on page 7 and 8 of the earnings package.","Recall that as part of our Wisconsin settlement, we agreed to apply the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. The plan is proceeding as expected. And then regarding the benefit of tax reform, we currently project that the transmission escrow balance at Wisconsin Electric will be reduced from approximately $220 million to $40 million or less by the end of 2019. As of September 30, 2018, the balance stands at about $125 million, nearly $100 million reduction from the year-end 2017.","My segment update will focus on the $4 million increase in operating income, as shown on page 9 of the packet. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, the increase in operating income net of tax adjustments was $6.5 million. Higher sales volumes drove approximately $34 million increase in margins. This was partially offset by a $20.2 million increase in operation and maintenance expense, and a $7 million increase in depreciation expense.","The increase in operations and maintenance expense was largely driven by two items. The first item was a $7.9 million expense related to staff reductions as we continue to streamline processes and reshape our generation portfolio. Second, we accrued $15 million related to the earnings sharing mechanism we have in place at our Wisconsin utilities. This was a result of our strong performance year-to-date.","In Illinois, operating income increased $800,000 net of tax adjustments. The increase was primarily driven by our continued investment in the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. Recall that this program is necessary to replace approximately 2,000 miles of cast iron pipes in practically one of every two streets in Chicago. Excluding the impact of tax reform, operating loss at our other states segment increased $4 million largely due to the timing of expenses in the quarter.","Turning to our non-utility energy infrastructure segment, excluding the impacts of tax reform, operating income at this segment increased by $800,000, mostly due to additional investments in our Power the Future plants. As a reminder, this segment also contains the operation at Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30, 2017 and one month of operation at Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center.","The operating loss at our corporate and other segment increased to $400,000 in the third quarter of 2018. Combining these changes and excluding the two tax items I discussed, operating income increased $4 million. Earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $33.7 million, a decrease of $5.5 million as compared to the third quarter of last year. Excluding the $8.4 million impact from tax reform, our equity earnings increased $2.9 million driven by continued capital investment.","Other income net increased by $8.3 million quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to decrease in the non-service cost component of our pension and benefit plans. Historically, the non-service cost component of these plans were reflected in operations and maintenance expense. However, a new accounting rule required it to be reclassified to other income in both years.","Our net interest expense increased $8.2 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by continued capital investments and slightly higher interest rates. Our consolidated income taxes decreased by $113 million. As previously discussed, lower tax expense was driven by the impact of tax reform and the flow-through of tax repairs. We expect our effective income tax rate will be between 14% and 15% this year. Excluding the benefits related to tax repairs, we expect the effective tax rate would be between 24% and 25%. These are generally in line with the expectations we provided on the last quarter call. Consistent with last quarter, we expect to be a cash taxpayer by the end of 2019.","Looking at the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $263 million during the first nine months of 2018. Recall that we made $100 million contribution to our pension plan in 2017. Higher earnings, as well as the decline in working capital, contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities.","Our capital expenditures totaled approximately $1.5 billion during the first nine months of 2018, a $181 million increase compared to the same period in 2017 as we continue to execute our capital plan. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52.3% at the end of the third quarter, a decrease from the 52.5% at the end of 2017. We continue to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 subordinated notes as common equity.","We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares and we continue to expect FFO-to-debt to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We paid $523 million in common dividends during the first nine months of 2018, an increase of $30.6 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 6.25% increase in the dividend level compared to the first nine months of 2017.","Moving to sales, we continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 11,000 more electric and 15,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 13, 14 of the earnings package.","Overall, retail deliveries of electricity, excluding the iron ore mine, were up 6% for the quarter and on a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries were up 2.6%. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 3.5% versus the third quarter of 2017. This excludes gas used for power generation. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew by 3.3% on a weather-normalized basis. Weather-normalized electric and natural gas volumes were above our expectations for the first nine months of 2018.","Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are reaffirming our 2018 earnings guidance of $3.32 a share. As always, this projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year. And as a reminder, our Wisconsin utilities are subject to an earnings sharing mechanism. I'm looking forward to seeing many of you at EEI and sharing details of our capital plan, which should continue to support our ability to grow efficiently the business.","With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Scott, thank you very much. We're still standing and we're focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we're ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the conference call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America. Your line is open.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi Julien, how are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey good, good afternoon. Congratulations.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, sir.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. I should add my congrats to Kevin there as well. So perhaps with that, I'd love to hear a little bit more on the CapEx plan articulated here. I know you addressed this, specifically the returns profile already. Just curious is that ROE change over time? Or is that pretty consistent as far as the criteria that you're employing and as best you understand the investments that you've already committed to that it's pretty consistent at that 50-50 at or above utility returns? And then also within that, if you could comment, have you \u2013 what portion of the energy infrastructure CapEx that you've delineated have you already sort of identified? I know that you've got at least one project named already thus far.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, very good questions, Julien. Thank you. First of all, in terms of the return criteria that we're using, let me back up and say that, I view this whole infrastructure segment that we've introduced over the last 24 months really as a sign of how strong the company is. As you know, we're one of the few companies in the industry that does not have to issue equity to finance our growth, that has a tax appetite and we're seeing \u2013 because of just the backdrop in the industry I believe, we're seeing very, very good assets that we're able to take a look at and able to be very discerning in terms of the particular projects that we would actually bring into the segment.","So long story short, certainly cash returns, IRRs and ROEs are all an integral part of how we look at these projects. And I do see the projects when we talk about at or above our retail rate of return for these projects, we're really looking at an average return over the course of the life of the projects. So that's, I hope, answering one of your questions. In many cases, the returns are somewhat higher in the early years, but when we look at this, we're looking at consistent returns on average across the life of the assets.","And then in terms of the projects that we already have basically underway, you remember last year, we closed on the Bluewater Natural Gas storage asset. And then this year, we added the Bishop Hill III, booked first at 80% ownership interest, now at 90% ownership interest, and we're also contractually committed to bring onboard next year after construction is complete the Upstream Wind Energy Center in Antelope County, Nebraska.","So in essence, one way to look at it is with Upstream coming on-stream next year, about 20% of the segment amount for the next five years is already in-house, if you will. And we have a number of projects in the pipeline that we're looking at. Some of which I think will come to fruition, but we have a very good robust pipeline of projects that we are taking a look at. Rest assured, we will be disciplined. And we're not going to do something that materially changes our risk profile and we're not going to do something that does not meet our return criteria. I hope that helps, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Absolutely. Excellent. And just a quick follow-up, a clarification, just with respect to the precise succession timing as you all think about it and don't mean to pin you down here and now but how are you thinking about it? Just the timeline here if you will?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","For CEO succession?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Yeah. Just to make sure we've got that clear.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay. Sure. Well, we have not set a timetable for any additional change at the CEO level. So I think, Julien, you'll have me around to ask questions to for quite a while.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Excellent. Okay, I'll leave it there. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Very good. Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Your next question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore. Your line is open.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good morning.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good morning, Greg. Yeah.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","How are you doing, Greg?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I'm good. Before I ask you any questions, do you have any questions for me about the Jets?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I kind of do, but we'll save those for later.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","By the way, my Bucks are 7-0.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","They do look good. Basketball is not New York's forte right now. That is for sure. So I've got a couple questions. The first is I know that and I asked you about this on the second quarter call, so I'd just love your observations after another quarter has gone by. I know that there's a lot of activity out at the Foxconn site, but there continues to be some question about exactly what they are going to build there. Now, I know they're committed at a high level to a level of investment and a level of job creation, but the level of economic demand pull for energy that comes from both that site and from the follow-on investment for the supply chain will be a big driver for what you ultimately have to invest to serve the region.","And so I'm wondering at this point, given that the increase in the CapEx budget, while it was substantial, wasn't demonstrably in the core electricity business, what you're waiting for in terms of visibility so that we can then get a sense of what you're going to need to invest to support the economic growth that comes from that?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good questions all, Greg, and let me take them one at a time. First of all, let me try to clarify the changes in our five-year capital plan compared to the previous plan for 2018 through 2022. What you see basically is an increase in the natural gas delivery segment because, again, we are seeing growth across the board in terms of all of our customer segments in terms of natural gas demand. And that includes about $140 million of capital that we expect to spend in the area that Foxconn is being developed.","So when you look at our capital spending, our focus remains clearly on the regulated business and the growth opportunities that we need to serve customers reliably in the regulated business. The increase in the natural gas delivery segment was somewhat offset by a slight decrease in transmission. And there, American Transmission is coming off of two very large projects that they're completing inside the footprint. And as you know, some of the transmission is a bit episodic and project by project. So the downturn we're seeing here in the American Transmission Company piece of the budget is really just reflecting the completion of two very large capital projects.","On the energy infrastructure piece that we talk about, it's only 10% of our projected capital spending for the next five years. So I just want to make sure that everyone understands. Our focus is still clearly on the growth in the regulated business and the investments we need to maintain reliability and great customer service. But we do see growth particularly in the natural gas delivery segment.","Now to Foxconn itself, they are in the final stages of completing their design for that entire campus, and our technical people meet with their folks literally every week. The changes that they have made so far have really had no material effect on the projected demand for electricity that we're seeing. We've been seeing for a number of months as they refine their designs a demand of about 180 megawatts, and that's still in place.","So I think to be honest with you, and we've seen some articles that frankly are absolute hit pieces, there's a lot going on right now, just tremendous progress on the campus and across the state. And in fact, just a few weeks ago the Chairman of Foxconn committed to a $100 million contribution to the engineering school at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. So they are full speed ahead from everything we can tell.","And in terms of the catalytic effect that I mentioned, there's already been announced in the area, within a few miles of where the Foxconn campus is going to be, there's already been announced $300 million of additional capital investment by non-related parties, medical complexes, hospitals, hotels, business parks. It's really amazing to see the immediate catalytic effect, and I think we're just at the front end of it.","So that's my summation of where we are. And again, from everything we can tell, even though their design has changed a bit, the fact that they're building what they call a Gen 6 instead of a Gen 10.5 fabrication facility hasn't changed what we're seeing in terms of either their demand for electricity or the catalytic effect that we're seeing that we expected to see.","Let me just put one number to it. We did a study. This was not a government study, this was something that we did with an outside econometric firm. And if Foxconn delivers on all the promises it has made we expect it to, and earns all the state tax credits, we would expect $54 billion over the next 15 years of new economic activity for the state, $54 billion, which would be about a return of 18:1 of the state tax credits. So that's my summation, Greg. I hope that helps.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","It does, thanks. That's all good. I'll hop off there. That's really thorough, thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse. Your line is open.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, Michael. How are you doing?","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Hi guys. Hey, Gale, how are you doing?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We're good.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Glad to hear it. Hey, if the returns are very similar to regulated returns on the energy infrastructure business, why limit it to 10%? Is there any risk that is not apparent that might want you \u2013 that might force you to limit to 10% or make it desirable to limit it in some way?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Michael, if I'm understanding your question, is there any risk that we see that might put the 10% returns in danger? Again, we're only looking at projects...","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","No. I'm thinking the 10%, like limiting it to 10% of earnings, I think that's what you were referring to before, right?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, no. What I meant was 10% of our capital spending plan for the next five years.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Okay. And why limit it to that? Why have any limitations on it if it's having the same kind of returns of the utility?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","To be honest with you, we are seeing enough significant opportunity directly in our retail regulated business that we're also seeing increased capital opportunities there. So we want to keep a reasonable balance here. If we saw some incredible opportunity that put us above the 10% of capital spending in that segment in the next five years, we will certainly do it. But I think that's a reasonable estimate at this point and again in part because we're also seeing really good opportunities in our core.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you. And also the $140 million that you alluded to for extra gas spending limits directly tied to the Foxconn site, is that for primary service to Foxconn itself? Or is that secondary service to surrounding community needs or growing community needs? Or is it some combination of both?","And then a follow-up question to that would be, you also said that this is just the very beginning stages of something that is going to be huge. Is that also the same \u2013 is the $140 million also the beginning of some potentially huge opportunity, just the tip of the iceberg, if you will?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Michael, just to be clear, the $140 million that we've actually filed for approval, the $140 million of gas distribution projects that we filed for approval with the Commission represents the additional investment that we think we're going to need to accommodate the economic growth in the region.","So it's Foxconn plus, if you will, so that's about $140 million investment, two separate gas distribution projects. Because we simply don't have enough infrastructure in terms of natural gas delivery in that area right now to accommodate both Foxconn's growth and the additional growth we're starting to see. Could the natural gas delivery segment grow even faster? If we see additional economic growth beyond what we're projecting in that area, yes. But at the moment, I think that initial $140 million investment will cover us for the next several years.","Michael Weinstein - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC","Got you, thank you very much.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from Praful Mehta with Citigroup. Your line is open.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Thanks so much. Hi guys.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","How are you doing?","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Hi, good. Well, thanks for taking my question. I guess the catalytic effect was actually quite an interesting point and it clearly sounds like a big opportunity around Foxconn going forward. How should we think about it though from a growth and opportunity perspective? If that plays out, is that increasing your growth from the 6% going forward? Or do you think about it more as maintaining the 6% but helping keep the build pressure down through that cycle? How should we kind of frame the opportunity from a utility perspective?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Great question and I think it's the latter. I mean, first of all, there's no question in my mind that all the economic development we're seeing. I mentioned Komatsu which is a major project right in the harbor district in Milwaukee. There's HARIBO, the candy company that's coming to Southeastern Wisconsin. Milwaukee Electric Tool has had two major expansions. Amazon a couple of years ago built a huge distribution center and is expanding or has expanded that distribution center. So all of that really is \u2013 and the investment opportunity for infrastructure, a regulated infrastructure that we need to make to support all that growth.","I think that is in my mind basically giving us an even longer runway to our 5% to 7% or in the middle of the range low 6% growth rate. And definitely with stronger kilowatt hour sales and you'll see as we roll out our plans in more detail at EEI, you'll see we've raised our projected growth rate of sales for both natural gas and electricity a bit. That's also helping to keep rate pressure down. No question about it.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks. That's helpful color. And then secondly, I mean given all this opportunity that you have around investment, both on the regulated and the unregulated side, I guess the constraining factor must be the balance sheet and the credit. And so just to understand that, you're clearly getting to be a cash taxpayer by 2019, so I guess at some point the metrics would come a little bit of pressure in 2021 as you become a cash taxpayer. Should we think about that as a constraining factor in terms of how much you can push from a credit perspective or holdco debt perspective? How should we think about credit in the context of this opportunity?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, I'll start and then I'm going to ask Scott for his view to give you as well. I would say this, I mean, and we did say we would expect absent any other infrastructure projects that we would become a cash taxpayer next year. But again, we have the tax appetite to be able to take on some very good projects that don't change our risk profile. So I don't particularly see \u2013 we are going to maintain a strong balance sheet, we're going to maintain our credit rating, we're going to maintain the FFO metrics where we need them to be. But I don't see that as a huge deterrent at this point.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, no, you're exactly correct, Gale. That 16% to 18% FFO-to-debt is right in line, in fact we're running at the high end of that this year. And as you look at opportunities, and you take 100% bonus depreciation perhaps on another project or two will even help our FFO in the other years. So we're comfortable in that 16% to 18%, we just want to be realistic on the opportunities and how we'd roll out our capital plan.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","Got you. Thanks, Scott. So you don't see it even in 2021 any pressure to that 16% to 18% coming down or staying at the lower end of that 16% to 18%.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No. Not at this time.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, not at this time. No.","Praful Mehta - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.","All right. Great. Much appreciated, guys. Thanks so much.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you for your question.","Operator","Your next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Hey, Gale. Thanks for taking my question.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're welcome Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I actually have one small housekeeping item which is, if I look at your $3.32 in EPS guidance for the year, and then the $2.70-ish or so you've done year-to-date, that implies $0.62 for the fourth quarter. That's below fourth quarter last year by a decent chunk. Just curious was there something in the fourth quarter last year that was unusual or abnormal that was a benefit that you might not get in this fourth quarter? Or is there something else fundamental or just one time in nature that is happening in the fourth quarter?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good question, Michael. And I think \u2013 and I'll ask Scott to give you some details on this. But long story short, our performance at the Wisconsin utilities has been very strong this year. And you remember the earnings sharing mechanism that we have in place with anything above our allowed retail rate of return. So, in essence, any outperformance that we would have in the fourth quarter of this year would basically be subject to the earnings sharing and therefore not flow through to our bottom line earnings per share report. So, you have to take into account where we were last year with earnings sharing and where we were this year. Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. That's exactly it. So going into last year's fourth quarter, we were not into earnings sharing. And between fuel and weather, we gained about $0.09 and just started to get into that sharing mechanism of about $2 million. And like Gale said, we're near the top of that 50-50 band now. So the opportunity for additional $0.09 doesn't exist.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay. One other thing, I'm going to sound like a broken record, you can go back and read transcripts for the last two and half years...","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You know when I can't get to sleep at night, I go back and where were the Michael questions?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Well, it's the same question every time because your demand growth numbers are clearly conservative, they have been for two, two and half, almost three years on the gas side, any thoughts on the fact that they maybe also conservative on the electric side as well? And what would have to happen to make you rebase higher?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, I think when you see all the details of our capital plan and our projections going forward, we have rebased a little bit. We were basically projecting flat almost 0% to 0.5% electric demand growth. I think Scott is adding almost 1% to that in terms of annual expectation of electric demand growth in light of the opportunity we're seeing. And then we're also rebasing up just a hair our natural gas expectation for growth as well.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That's correct. And this last year across-the-board and every class we're seeing that natural gas. So having stable gas prices I don't \u2013 residential customer growth is good but still as appliances get replaced, they're just becoming more efficient. So, I just have a hard time seeing residential continue to grow at that same pace year-over-year other than new customers.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it guys. Thank you. Much appreciated, Gale, Scott.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're welcome, Michael. See you soon.","Operator","Your next question comes from Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, guys.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hey, Jonathan. Jonathan, a question for you, I've been meaning to ask, how's your mom doing in England?","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Oh, yeah. She is fine. Thank you. Gale, they haven't deported me yet, but we'll see how we go with that.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, she's still getting good electricity from my former company I take it.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yes, indeed. So just on the capital plan you gave us the 10% number. I mean, this might be something you'd rather save for EEI, but when you showed that graphic before, the energy infrastructure was 8% for the capital plan excluding transmission. Are we now talking about 10% on the same basis? Or is it 10% of the $14.1 billion?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No. It's 10% of the $14.1 billion.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then on transmission, just looking back, I think what you had said was that you were booking 10.82%. But you expect it to migrate to something like 10.20% ROE at some point. My question is at what point in your sort of projection of this earnings, the 6% level, do you see that migration happening? And then if you have any comments on this related machinations out of FERC on the model?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, Jonathan, you're correct on both counts. We're still booking because that's the allowed rate of return today, the 10.82% on our earnings from American Transmission Company. As you know there have been a number of complaints from around the country pending at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission from customers asking whether or not the current allowed rates of return on transmission all over the U.S. are \"in the zone of reasonableness or not.\"","As you know, FERC has begun to take some action. The first indication of where they might go just came probably 10 days, two weeks ago, when they began looking at the complaint that's on their docket from the Northeastern United States, the Northeastern Utilities, if you will. And FERC has laid out for comment a proposed new methodology, which combines four different metrics as opposed to just a single metric that they have been using in the past.","Again, I think it's going to be a while before we get any clarity from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission because I believe first of all there's a 60-day comment period. That puts us close to the end of December, so I would expect them to take some action in the first half or first quarter of next year. And then I would guess that the Midwestern complaints would be on the docket after that. But we are still assuming that the 10.2% will come down, and our conservative estimate right now is 10.2%. And that 10.2% is embedded in our 5% to 7% growth rate, Scott.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That's correct. So we haven't made a final determination of when we think it will go down yet, but for our five-year plan we're assuming it goes to the 10.2%, which that includes the 50 basis point adder for being part of MISO.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you for that clarity. And then just on the \u2013 you gave some pretty explicit guidance on where you see earnings within the range. Do you see with this plan a reasonably linear trajectory, or is it possible to start out higher and migrate lower, that way you have less visibility at the back end, just any \u2013 or was that intended more as throughout the plan type of level?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It really was intended pretty much to be linear throughout the plan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. That's all I have. Thank you, Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're welcome, Jonathan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Your line is open.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","How are you, Gale?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We're good. How are you, Paul?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good. Just along the lines of a previous question, the 10% of the CapEx budget being for the infrastructure segment, is that constrained at all by your statement that you won't issue equity? If you're willing to issue equity, could you make that bigger?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","If we wanted to issue equity, we could make it bigger, I assume. But again, we are being very, very disciplined in terms of the projects that we want to bring into this segment. So I think the reason we landed on this particular number for the Energy Infrastructure segment and the reason we ended up at 10% of our expected capital spend over the next five years with basically 20% of it already done, is \u2013 that's about the quality of the projects we're looking at.","I think since we're being very disciplined and very risk-averse here, and we're not going to change our risk profile, that amount is about what I think we can spend in terms of the kind of projects we want to bring in-house. So it's really constrained more by our disciplined approach, by our return criteria than it is, I think, Scott, by any type of financial constraint.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No. If opportunities came, we'd have room to even do more than that 5% to 7% without issuing any equity. So it's not the financial, it's more of the opportunities to make sure we're realistic in the expectations to achieve our returns.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you, that's helpful. And then just on the FERC ROEs, are you reserving at all against the 10.82%?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, the 10.82% we are not. There is one complaint period that does exist that is open yet, and that is reserved at that 10.2% level. But that's the open complaint period that we're waiting to hear the final results on.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And then on the FERC rules, basically the 10.2% \u2013 for this period the 10.2% is basically the allowed return.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","The 10.82%.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I'm sorry the 10.82%, yes, is the allowed return. So other than the one complaint period that Scott talked about where we do have a reserve, we don't think there's any real challenge ability to basically take on the 10.82% because that is the allowed return for this period.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Correct.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay, thank you.","Gale E.

Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. Hey, my Bucks are 7-0.","Vedula Murti - Avon Capital","Okay, something to look forward to. My question was mostly what Greg had asked about more with Foxconn. And obviously, there's a lot of noise around it and lots of politics and posturing or whatever. But within all of that, what is it that we should really pay attention to, to find out whether in fact there may be some lag or some give or whatever term you want to use in terms of what maybe some people thought about either its timing or its scale of capital investment relating to what we believe we've heard about originally?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Everything we're seeing is Foxconn is full speed ahead. Now we do have a gubernatorial election here and there have been some discussions by the Democratic candidate for governor on whether or not he would want to relook the incentive package for Foxconn. If that were to happen I mean if he were to be elected and he decided to find some way to overturn legislation that's in place that probably would be a factor that you would want to look at in terms of whether or not there would be some slowdown in the Foxconn plan. But right now given what Foxconn is actually doing on the campus, the construction progress they're making, the additional investments across the state that they've announced, right now it appears that they are full speed ahead.","Vedula Murti - Avon Capital","Okay, I appreciate the clarification.

Your line is open.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon, guys.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Paul. What's shaking?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Not much. What I wanted to ask you about was just sort of back on the infrastructure projects. You mentioned that the returns might be on the high side initially in terms of how you're looking at the trajectory of the return. And I'm just wondering if you could sort of give a little bit more flavor as to when we look at this CapEx, what the earnings profile is over time, do you follow me?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sure. And again, over time with the projects that we have in hand and the projects we have announced, we would expect over time over kind of our useful life of the project the returns to meet the kind of criteria we talked about which is at or slightly above our retail rates of return.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right. But I guess what I'm wondering is, is that, you made it sound like some of it might be frontend loaded. And so what I'm wondering is, I understand that on average over time that's what it would be, but it sounds like some of it might be frontend loaded, and so I wanted to get more of a sense as to how that might be distributed? Do you follow me? How much of a boost we might be seeing in the early years versus later years?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. Let me frame that for you and then I'll let Scott give you some detail. The projects we're talking about really are in many cases either solar or wind or gas storage or some type of renewables. Particularly with the wind, you have a very heavy tax credit influence in the early years. Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, specifically, the two projects we've had so far on the wind side, production tax credits are in the first 10 years, so the returns are north of that 10% by a couple of percentage points in that first 10-year period along with good cash returns because of the bonus depreciation. So it's really that first 10 years when you have the production tax credits that really make it a little higher on average.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So really we're going to be looking \u2013 sorry, I don't mean to interrupt you. Go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No problem. I also was going to say actually believe it or not because of the cash returns, it's helpful to our FFO to debt calculation.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, sure. So, okay \u2013 so we're talking basically like the PTC kind of concept, so we're talking like a good period of time where you'll be having the higher returns versus you won't be having \u2013 there are no big upfront benefits to EPS. This is more just a 10-year timeframe where you're going to be...","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. Right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay. Just wanted to make sure about that. And then the other question that I have is, so there's a decrease in electric generation in the ATC and you mentioned something about the ROE, and I apologize if I just wasn't completely clear on this. But the ATC \u2013 the fall off in the CapEx, did that have to do with what you're seeing in terms of returns and what have you? Or could you just clarify a little bit about what's driving the change in CapEx profile at ATC and if it has anything to do with the ROE cases that you're seeing?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Nothing whatsoever to do with the ROE cases. Everything to do with the fact that ATC is just completing two very large construction projects, transmission project extensions and new transmission in our footprint. And they're rolling off these two very large projects from a year. So we have a high year comparing to a slightly lower year, but it has nothing to do with the potential change in ROE.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, most of my questions were answered.

Now, many of you know Beth from her work over the past decade or so as one of the more perceptive analysts covering our industry. I want to tell you we've forgiven her for that, and we're delighted that she's with us.","Turning now to the second quarter, Pat will review our financial results in detail a bit later on the call, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share for the second quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.59 a share for the second quarter of 2014. I should point out that the numbers we're reporting to you today reflect Wisconsin Energy only. Since the acquisition closed on June 29, Integrys earnings were immaterial.","Taking a very quick look now at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate stood at 4.6% in June, well below the national average. Deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers, however, excluding the iron ore mines, fell by 1.4% in the second quarter. But several sectors showed strength including plastics, printing, and food processing.","Also, our small commercial and industrial segment is growing, with electricity use rising by 2.3% over the second quarter of a year ago. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. New electric service connections are up 8.2% and new natural gas installations are up 4% compared to the same time period last year.","Now I'd like to spend the next few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighed it against our three important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. After considerable due diligence we found that it met or exceeded all three criteria. First, it would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would be largely credit-neutral. And third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate.","We also saw tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach, and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage those strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve, to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we will incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and reduce costs.","So what does our new footprint look like? Well, as I mentioned the new company provides electricity and natural gas to 4.4 million customers across four states through our customer-facing brands: We Energies, Wisconsin Public Service, Peoples Gas, North Shore Gas, Michigan Gas Utilities, and Minnesota Energy Resources. Our company operates in a balanced regulatory environment with greater jurisdictional diversity than before the acquisition. And of course, more than 99% of our earnings will come from regulated operations.","WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States, with significant opportunities for growth. Of course, the majority of the earning assets we acquired are here in Wisconsin, a familiar landscape for us, and major infrastructure upgrades are underway now at Wisconsin Public Service in the northern part of the state. These investment opportunities are similar to those we have pursued over the years, on time and on budget, at We Energies.","We are also in excellent position to take advantage of new customer growth across the region, especially in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Minnesota, where propane and oil users are continuing to convert to natural gas. In addition, as many of you know, Integrys and Wisconsin Energy were the two largest owners of American Transmission Company. Today WEC Energy Group has become a 60% owner of ATC. As you will recall, ATC plans to invest between $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion between 2014 and 2023 to bolster electric reliability in our service area. We believe this is a solid plan, and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business.","Now I would like to briefly discuss some of the conditions we agreed to as we worked our way through the regulatory approvals for the acquisition. In Wisconsin, we committed to an earnings cap for our Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas subsidiaries. Starting in 2016, next year, we will share with our customers any earnings in excess of our allowed rate of return. The first 50 basis points of earnings above our authorized return will be split equally between the company and our customers. Then any earnings above that level will go exclusively to customers. This sharing mechanism will be in effect through 2018.","We also agreed to develop an integrated resource plan detailing the joint capacity needs of Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. We expect to file the resource plan with the Wisconsin Commission later this quarter.","In Michigan, as we've discussed on previous calls, we expect to pursue the formation of a Michigan-only utility. Our customers in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan would be served by this entity. And we expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and\/or purchase power from a new facility. This would allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Power Plant.","In Illinois, we agreed to retain a minimum level of jobs in the State of Illinois for the next two years. We also committed to a two-year base rate freeze and a capital spending floor from 2015 through 2017.","In a recent development this past Friday, the Citizens Utility Board, the City of Chicago and the State Attorney General's Office asked the Illinois Commerce Commission to rehear our merger order. These parties are seeking additional conditions, conditions that they previously requested during the year-long approval process.","The Illinois Commission now has until August 13 to accept or deny the request. We believe the Commission's June 24 decision was correct and is supported by sound principles and by an extensive body of evidence.","Now let's touch on some of the key financial metrics for the new company. For starters, as you may recall we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt is approximately 2.2% annually, an excellent result and clearly lower than we anticipated.","So for 2016 we now project our growth in earnings per share to be in the range of 6% to 8%. The 6% to 8% growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy standalone achieves earnings of $2.72 a share this year, which is the midpoint of our current 2015 guidance.","So, just to clarify, we start with a base of $2.72 a share for our standalone earnings this year, and we expect the combined company to grow earnings per share in the 6% to 8% range next year.","For the longer term, after 2016 we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline, and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance. We look forward to providing you with additional details on our capital investment plans at the EEI Finance Conference coming up in November.","Regarding our dividend policy, in June, the Wisconsin Energy Board of Directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.4575 a share. That's an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. Going forward we will target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. And we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share.","Switching gears now, I'd like to update you on several of our major construction projects. On the generation side of our business, as you may recall, we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units as part of our ongoing Power the Future initiative.","These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal; however, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend.","During extensive testing, we identified operational and equipment-related improvements that will be needed to sustain the higher blends of PRB coal on a long-term basis. In May, the Wisconsin Commission approved our requests for additional capital spending for plant modifications, expansion of all of our coal storage capacity, and additional coal handling equipment.","We've already started work to expand our coal storage capability, and the first in-plant capital improvements are expected to be made on the first unit at Oak Creek, the Oak Creek expansion, during a planned outage this September. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of 2016. Our share of these investments is targeted at approximately $80 million.","Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. That conversion is now more than 80% complete. Total conversion costs are expected to be in the $60 million to $65 million range, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the project on time and on budget before the end of this year.","Our Western Wisconsin natural gas expansion project, which will address natural gas reliability concerns in the western part of the state, is now more than 75% complete and is running on time and better than budget. We expect to complete this new 85-mile natural gas pipeline in the fourth quarter of this year at a cost actually well below the $175 million budget, a budget that again excludes allowance for funds used during construction.","Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in Wisconsin Energy's traditional business as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on Delivering the Future.","Just to remind you, Wisconsin Energy's standalone capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion over the five-year period 2015 through 2019, and our 10-year standalone capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024.","Now before I turn the call over to Pat, I would also like to discuss our plans for the accelerated main replacement program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. Just to refresh your memory, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipeline system over the next 20 years. Some of these pipes, ladies and gentlemen, literally date back to the time of the Civil War.","One of our immediate and most important goals is to improve the management and performance of this project. Our first step was to appoint a new senior management team at Peoples: a new President, a new Vice President for construction, a new operations Vice President, and a new Vice President for customer service. All of them are proven, experienced leaders from the Wisconsin Energy system.","Over the past three weeks, our team has conducted a thorough evaluation of the accelerated main replacement program. They have determined that the best approach is a fresh start.","We have begun transitioning the management of the project to in-house personnel; previously the project was managed by an outside contractor. Going forward, we also plan to engage a nationally recognized firm to help conduct an independent, bottom-up review of the cost, scope, and schedule for the program.","This past Monday we notified the Illinois Commerce Commission of our decisions, and we will incorporate these decisions into a broader transition plan. This broader transition plan will address the recommendations made by Liberty Consulting Group in their audit of the program.","The Liberty audit was completed earlier this year at the request of the Illinois Commerce Commission. I am confident that the steps we are taking will ensure that Chicagoans get the safe, modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve.","In conclusion, these are exciting times, filled with opportunity for our new combined company and we believe we have a very bright future ahead. We will build an enduring enterprise by focusing on the fundamentals: world-class reliability, operating efficiency, financial discipline, and exceptional customer care.","And now for more details on our second quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of 2015, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat.","J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share. That's the same as our adjusted earnings for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Costs related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.24 per share in the second quarter of 2015 and $0.01 per share in the second quarter of 2014. Because of the timing of the acquisition, earnings results this quarter are exclusively from Wisconsin Energy.","Going forward, our consolidated earnings will include the operating results of the Integrys companies. Please note that the balance sheet included in this quarter's earnings package does incorporate the Integrys balance sheet. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for Wisconsin Energy's two business segments, and then discuss other income, interest expense, and income taxes.","Excluding acquisition related costs, second quarter consolidated operating income was $232.5 million, as compared with $245.8 million in 2014. That's a decline of $13.3 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $140.4 million for 2015, a decline of $14.8 million from the second quarter of 2014.","On a quarter-over-quarter basis, our earnings were helped by $9.5 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case and by $3.4 million related to improved fuel recoveries. On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $18.5 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects, and certain benefit costs.","We estimate that weather reduced our margins by $4.8 million and we also saw increased depreciation expense of $4.2 million. Combining these and other factors results in the $14.8 million decline in utility operating income in the second quarter of 2015, compared with the same quarter in the prior year.","Operating income in our non-utility energy segment was $93.5 million, which is $1.8 million higher than the prior year. Our corporate and other segment, which includes corporate costs of smaller affiliates, was essentially flat with last year's second quarter. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at the second-quarter operating income before acquisition-related costs of $232.5 million, a $13.3 million decline as compared to the second quarter of 2014.","In addition, for the second quarter of 2015 we recognized $66.7 million of acquisition-related costs associated with benefit plan agreements, legal and banking fees, and other costs. Overall these costs were in line with our expectations.","During the second quarter of 2015, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $14.3 million, a decline of $3.2 million from the same period in the prior year. As we mentioned in the first quarter, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC related to authorized returns for regional transmission organizations.","Our earnings reflect Wisconsin Energy's share of ATC's results. Our other income net increased by $18 million. During the second quarter of 2015, we recognized an incremental gain of $15.2 million on the sale of the legacy asset. The purchase and sale of assets is a regular part of our business. In fact, we have a real estate development subsidiary, and this quarter's sale was part of our financial plan for the year.","Our net interest expense increased by $3.1 million, primarily because of higher debt levels. Consolidated income tax expense fell by $11.1 million for the quarter. Going forward, WEC Energy Group's annual effective income tax rate, driven by a one-time adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% in 2015.","We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective tax rate for 2015 will be between 37% 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to the adjusted net income of $0.59 per share for the second quarter of 2015.","During the first six months of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $715.9 million, which is a $5.4 million decrease from the first six months of 2014. During 2015, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans; no such contributions were made during 2014.","Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital. For example, lower natural gas prices dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas and storage.","Our capital expenditures totaled $356.5 million in the first six months of 2015, a $51 million increase compared to 2014. The increase was primarily driven by the increased expenditures related to the western gas lateral.","Our adjusted debt to capital ratio as of June 30th, 2015 was 50.7%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition, treating half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","We paid $190.5 million in common dividends in the first six months of 2015. That's an increase of $14.5 million over the same period last year. Weather normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 1.3% in the second quarter of 2015 as compared to the second quarter of 2014. Actual second quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%.","Looking now at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell 5%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries rose by 2.4%. Actual deliveries rose by 2.3%.","In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the second quarter of 2015 fell by 2.5%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 1.4%.","Our year-to-date weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding the gas used for power generation, were flat compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding the gas used for power generation, were down 7.2% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first six months of 2015 are slightly behind our expectations for the year.","Turning now to our earnings forecasts, for the remainder of 2015 we will continue to guide based on standalone Wisconsin Energy earnings. As Gale mentioned, our long-term earnings per share growth rate is based upon these standalone earnings. We will therefore make the following adjustments to the WEC Energy Group GAAP earnings.","Number one, remove the impact of Integrys; number two, remove the impact of acquisition debt. As Gale noted previously, we funded the 1.5 billion cash portion of the acquisition with $1.2 billion of long-term debt and $300 million of commercial paper. This long-term debt included 3, 5, and 10-year tranches. Overall, our debt has an approximate interest cost of 2.2% annually.","Number three, remove the impact of acquisition and other one-time costs such as banking and legal fees. Number four, modify effective tax rates to remove the impact of the one-time adjustment I just referred to earlier. And finally, number five, remove the impact of the additional shares issued as part of the acquisition.","With that, we'll move to our 2015 guidance. We are reaffirming our 2015 standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We are off to a strong start, but still have six months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share.","And finally let's take a look at third quarter guidance. Last year's third quarter adjusted earnings were $0.57 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys. Similar to last year, our summer got off to a very slow start this year, with temperatures significantly below normal during the first 10 days of July.","So taking this July weather into account, we expect our third quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in a range of $0.56 to $0.58 a share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining transition-related costs. Once again, our third quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.56 to $0.58 a share.","And with that I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Pat, thank you very much. Appreciate the detail and the clarity. And overall, folks, we're solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And now we would like to take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Afternoon to you. Congrats on closing the deal finally, not too bad.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","All right, we'll see later this week.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Indeed we will. So perhaps the first question here out of the gate, the 5% to 7% earnings growth rate, when you are thinking about that in the context of this transaction being closed, how are you thinking about the trajectory in 2016 and reflecting some of the improvement, hopefully, in the earned ROEs across the legacy Integrys platform? And perhaps maybe could you remind us or refresh our memory of where the earned ROEs stand today, just for some background if you will.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sure, I'd be happy to. Let me first start with the initial part of your question. How do we think about the trajectory of earnings going forward here now that we have closed the acquisition? As you may have heard me say on the script, given everything we see today and given the terrific result that we got in terms of the annual interest cost on the parent company debt, we are projecting 2016 to have a growth rate over our standalone 2015 guidance, the midpoint of that guidance. So we are projecting 2016 to grow 6% to 8%. And then post 2016 we still see a 5% to 7% growth rate.","There are a couple of important underlying assumptions that we are making and that we really feel very good about delivering related to the growth rate. The first is that we believe we can through best practices, through cost reduction, through financial discipline, and through on-time and on-budget investing in the infrastructure upgrades that are needed, we believe we can move all of the utilities that are the former Integrys utilities at or near the allowed rates of return in Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota, and of course WPS in Wisconsin. So that's a pretty important underlying assumption.","And to your question of, well, where were the allowed rates of return for those utilities? Just a reminder that We Energies and Wisconsin Gas have historically earned at or very close to and in some years slightly above the allowed rates of return. With that, Pat has the specific numbers on where the other Integrys utilities have been from an ROE standpoint. Pat?","J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","So, Julien, let's start with the two biggest ones. Wisconsin Public Service last year earned just above 10%; and as a reminder its authorized was 10.2%, so just underneath allowed. The second biggest or the other big one would be Peoples Gas. That last year was about 5%, and that's out of an allowed 9%. Then the other three utilities last year \u2013 that would be North Shore, Minnesota, and Michigan, two of the three hit; one was beneath, but the year before, the one that missed hit and another one didn't. So they're more or less maybe slightly underneath on average is probably the simplest way to state that. Does that help?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Absolutely, that's great. And perhaps just getting back to my question a little bit more broadly, as you think about 2016 to 2017, are you earning a full year earned ROE? Just I'm trying to think about some of the continued benefits as you flow that forward, right. So thinking about the 5% to 7% in conjunction with what is likely \u2013 I don't want to put words in your mouth too much \u2013 but what is likely still an annualizing factor into that higher level, I would imagine.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I'm not sure I exactly followed you, but perhaps I can answer.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Or are you expecting to earn a full year at or near the ROEs in 2016 already, just to be clear about that, or is there an annualizing factor?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Starting in 2016 we are expecting to earn a full-year annualized rate of return, yes. And let me help with that one piece, because you're probably wondering like, well, how do you go from 5% to 9% at Peoples Gas? That's a very good question, Julien. I'm glad you asked it. Peoples Gas did get a resolution of a rate case in January of this year, and I believe the allowed increase was $71 million. A lot of that, Julien, was for catch-up capital that had already been invested in the infrastructure in Chicago. So the fact that a rate case has been adjudicated and they are seeing the benefit of the $71 million increase is helpful on that front. I hope that's helpful to you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","It is indeed. And sorry to belabor it, just one last one in terms of the integrated resource plan. How are you thinking about that now? Obviously there was some shifts in the gas generation plans earlier. What is the current expectation vis-\u00e0-vis load growth as you stand today, as you close the deal? Would you expect a shift back in generation resources meaningfully from what has been discussed through the course of this merger approval?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Let me try the first piece and then we're going to let Allen give you the detail on the integrated resource plan that we'll be filing later this quarter with the Wisconsin Commission. Long story short, there is no change in terms of our long-term demand growth projection. Wisconsin Public Service and our company have pretty similar demand growth projections going forward, roughly 0.05% a year basically in electricity demand growth. Our belief, though, when you look at the portfolio of generation that the two companies have together, our belief is there can be some real synergies there. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right, and just review for everyone, Julien, who might not know the Fox Energy Center, which is a plant that's owned by Wisconsin Public Service, before agreeing to the merger with Wisconsin Energy they had planned to build a facility called Fox 3, which was going to be a natural gas fired combined-cycle unit. And then as Gale mentioned in the script, essentially what the Commission said is: Well, all right, look at the resources at both of your Wisconsin utilities and tell us overall whether that unit is still needed.","So, Julien, what we've been able to do to date, we've looked just simply at what I guess I would call the capacity demand balance between the two utilities. If we look solely at the capacity demand balance, my expectation would be that you can easily defer Fox unit 3 for a number of years. The analysis that we are doing to go in addition to that capacity and demand is a bit of an energy analysis, if you will. If you look at the energy mix of the two utilities, my expectation is that it will confirm the capacity demand balance and that the unit will be deferred. But that's what we're in the process of doing. And then as Gale mentioned in the third quarter we'll do a formal filing to the Wisconsin Commission along those lines.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And Julien, the Fox 3 was estimated to be about a $600 million capital investment, which again based on our preliminary look we believe can be deferred.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you for all the color.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You are more than welcome. Good questions Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","All right, Greg. I want to give you a shot here. Are the Jets going to be above .500?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Based on the strength of schedule, I'm going to say yes.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","All right.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Not necessarily based on the talent, on the team, but based on the strength of the schedule.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And any kind of playoff expectations, Greg?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Well, there's always hope. Jets are used to having a lot of that.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, I hope it's a good season for you. How are you doing, Greg?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Good. I just want to cut to the chase and just make sure I hear you clearly. Making all the adjustments you guys laid out, you were very articulate. We should expect you to still be inside the guidance range pre-Integrys. And then we should expect on a full run rate, merger-integrated basis for fiscal year 2016 that you will grow 6% to 8% earnings off that number?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That is correct. You've nailed it.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, perfect. So you've taken into account everything that's going on including the one-time impact of this legacy asset sale. You think that everything in the stewpot, that's a number you can hit?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We're certainly expecting to do so. But let me mention this one-time thing you mentioned about the one-time legacy asset sale. We have with the combined company like $29 billion of assets. I think every year, Greg, since I've been here we've had some type of asset sale. And remember we also have a real estate subsidiary that develops and sells property. So it's part of our ongoing, it's just part of what we do. And I would suspect you want us to do this, because it's part of maximizing the value of our assets.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","No, completely understand. I just wanted to be clear on it. My second question is as we think about your cash flow profile, pro forma for the deal, still superior and differentiating factor about your investment thesis relative to almost any other utility, given the robust cash flow nature of the Power the Future assets. How should we think about the cash flow deployment priorities of the company as they are built into that 6% to 8%, going to 5% to 7%, expectation?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","In terms of the cash flow priorities, number 1 through 10 is obviously investing in infrastructure upgrades that are very much needed for customers across the four states. And as I mentioned at the EEI Fall Finance Conference, we'll give you a lot more granular detail particularly about our next three- to five-year capital investment program. But we see tremendous need and tremendous opportunity for the use of that cash flow to upgrade the electric and natural gas infrastructures in the region. So that's priority number 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 10 for the cash flow.","And then obviously we want to maintain the 65% to 70% target for dividend payouts. And if there's any cash left over, well, we've got three doors we can go through. One is debt reduction. One would be if we can find, legitimately, additional investment opportunities and additional infrastructure projects. And then the third would be where we were before, which is a share buyback. But I would hope that and really am very hopeful that there will be additional investment opportunities that are really needed and that we can put that cash to really good use through infrastructure upgrades.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay, great. Just to be clear, are there any specific commitments vis-\u00e0-vis the current rating and the discussions you've had with the rating agencies on how you're going to manage the parent debt balance over the next few years?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Pat? I'll let Pat answer that.","J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","What we talked about, Greg, was the reason we tranched the acquisition debt is that our expectation is that as each tranche matures or comes to its end, we will have sufficient cash flow to be able to not renew that tranche. So in other words we plan to take it out. In addition to that I might add that we're also looking at what I'm just going to call balance sheet cleanup or looking at some of the other debt that is sitting out there at the Holding Company and what opportunities we've got to clean some of that up as well.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Perfect. Thanks, guys.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Great, questions. Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","How are you doing, Jonathan?","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You just reiterated the 65% to 75% dividend payout target, Gale. And you obviously bumped it a little bit more than you were committed to post the merger.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. We thought you would like that, Jonathan.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right. My question is it looks like the payout of the midpoint of the 2016 guidance is going to be 63%. How soon do you want to get in the range? You've typically done December increases. How should we think about that range versus what you've just been discussing around investment priorities?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, it's a question we will continue to look at between now and the end of the year. But certainly in the relatively near term, we very much want to be at least in the bottom end of the 65% to 70% range.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Then what would push you I guess broadly as you look at the earnings for the quarter, into (39:27) to the higher end of that long-term growth rate? Do you have a line of sight on what kind of things we should be looking for you to announce?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Very good question. Let me frame the answer; if Pat or Allen would like to add, I would certainly welcome them to do so. Let me frame the answer for you. There is not one single thing that could pop us to the top end of the range on a permanent basis. But if you think about our business and where we're headed, there are several factors, the biggest of which would be increased investment opportunity or increased investment requirement that we build on time and on budget and get cost recovery for. That would be the single biggest thing.","In between rate cases, if you have an economic pickup and there's stronger sales growth, there are a number of things that can happen in between rate periods. But the single biggest factor that could drive us to the top end would be additional investment opportunities in infrastructure upgrades. Pat, Allen, anything you would like to add?","J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, I got just a couple things I could throw in, Jonathan. I think Gale hit the main one, but other things I would think about would be opportunity sales that would help us on the fuel recovery, to the extent that our fleet is called more by the MISO. And the other would be hitting some, we talked about our ATC 10 year capital plan and the range it could be in. You are also familiar with our joint venture with Duke, the DATC. To the extent that some of those projects hit or we get to the top higher end of that capital plan, that would also help.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That's a good point, Pat. So it all comes down \u2013 well, it doesn't all, but a lot of it comes down to: are there additional investment opportunities as we go forward beyond the plan that we'll be pretty granular about with you at EEI in the fall.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Great. If I may, just on one other point, you talked about having filed with the ICC to tell them you're going to have a rethink around the main replacement program. Does that include some proposal for how to resolve the ongoing investigation? Or is that a separate issue? Any perspective on how we bring that to closure?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It's a very good question. Let me be clear about the ongoing dockets. There's one very helpful ongoing docket. And let me back up and explain that. The commission, before we got involved with the potential acquisition, the commission brought in an outside consulting group by the name of Liberty Consulting to basically do a review of the management, the physical on-the-ground management of the gas main replacement project.","Liberty has come back with 95 specific recommendations, most of which are very practical and all of which we agree with. So what the commission has done is they've kept that docket open and they've asked us by September, early September, to file a transition plan that in part lays out how we plan to incorporate those recommendations into our management of the program.","So, I think a lot of what you're asking about has a schedule and has a definite plan for resolution. But I view the Liberty Consulting report as very helpful and certainly I know the commission has a good bit of faith in the recommendations. The recommendations are very practical. They are recommendations that we would automatically have put into our transition plan anyway. And so I think that's the way, as we take a step back and re-look the entire project from soup to nuts, from scope to schedule, to logistics, we will be incorporating the Liberty audits along the way and Liberty will also have input along the way.","So, again, a schedule and a date has been set for us telling the commission how we plan to incorporate the Liberty recommendations and I think that will go a long way, in addition to the expertise that we're going to bring to this project.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're welcome.","Operator","The next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Michael.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Gale, congrats on the deal. Congrats on getting everything closed and rolling out new guidance.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","One question, though. I know you are starting from the base of a $2.72 midpoint for WEC standalone.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm just trying to put apples \u2013 I'm worried we are comparing apples and oranges here. Because Integrys has a large gas utility presence; that means it generates or delivers a decent amount of its annual earnings in the fourth quarter. And just are you thinking that the second half of this year that Integrys would actually have contributed to our EPS? Or would it have detracted from EPS from the original standalone entity? Because a lot will depend on what your starting point is and the starting point here is a little confusing.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, I'm glad you asked the question. Let us answer it very directly. First of all, yes, we're picking up a lot of gas, gas delivery companies. And yes, they generally have a pretty good fourth quarter. They also have a lousy third quarter simply because of lack of gas demand.","But let's step back here. A couple factors. First of all, the financial logic for the acquisition was that an acquisition that we would want to make, like the Integrys acquisition, would add to our earnings per share growth in the first full calendar year after closing. So, that's 2016. So, I think the logical starting point is okay; well, what would you have done standalone 2015? What would your growth rate standalone have been 2016? And is this better than that?","And the answer is yes, it's better than that. So, I think if it's making any sense to you, Michael, I think we're starting with the correct starting point. But I would like to add one other factor and that is in the second half of this year there will be significant accounting adjustments. A lot of accounting noise around the acquisition, as you even saw in our second quarter adjustments. So really the GAAP numbers for Integrys, the Integrys utilities for the second half of 2015 are really going to be irrelevant to the long-run earnings capability of Integrys utilities going forward. Does that help, Michael?","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","It helps. Let me ask another follow-on question, and I can catch up with your IR team or Pat offline. When you think about how far you are in the process of evaluating things like synergy opportunities or other opportunities to benefit \u2013 I mean, merger has only been closed for not quite 30 days, actually right at 30 days.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","How early in the process do you think you are? And do you think there is upside to whatever it is you are assuming today in potential long run, multiyear benefits from the merger?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Very good question, Michael. Let me just say this. We are less than 30 days in. Right now we are very much on target in terms of our plan for follow-on integration. Everybody understands where they report. Everyone has budget targets for 2016. And we are in the process of working through every single functional area to determine where we go and what the shape of their organizations look like. So it's a little early to give you much more granular detail, but let me back up.","There's nothing that we've seen that would indicate that our earlier thinking and information we've said publicly, there's nothing to indicate that that's off-track. I would expect that over the 10 years there will be a minimum of $1 billion of savings for Wisconsin customers alone in a combination of capital and operating costs. And that to me still stands as a good preliminary early estimate. So we'll keep working on it, but right now I feel very good about where we are.","And let me back-up to your earlier question again. Remember the $2.72 that we're talking about as the base for 2015 is Wisconsin Energy standalone. So we're basically taking out either a positive or negative impact of Integrys utilities for the second half of the year, to give you a clean starting point, if you will that was basically the foundation for the logic of the acquisition.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Understood. I appreciate the help, guys. I may follow up offline.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you, Michael.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Thanks, Gale.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Welcome, Jim. How are you?","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I'm tired. How are you?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Tired? What, you've been listening to the Southern call too long?","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yep, that's and I'm on an airplane back from Tokyo. Hey, I have a couple questions for you. I'm confused and I'm having a little translation issue. Can you translate how much the operating efficiencies mean on a dollar basis?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I'm sorry, one more time?","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I tried to avoid the S word.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you. Have we translated how much the operating efficiencies mean on a dollar basis?","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. You talk about robust operating efficiencies. What does that mean on a dollar basis?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That means basically getting to our allowed rates of return and staying there for 2016 and beyond.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. I get it, I get it. Second question, totally different is, with all the noise that's going on in the State of Illinois, can you talk about the legal precedent for changing conditions once a merger has been actually, you have an order and it has been consummated?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, generally in all past cases, for the Illinois Commerce Commission to change its order, there generally would need to be new facts or some demonstration of an error in the facts that form the basis for the merger order. In this case, none of us see new facts or errors in fact. As a matter of fact, the Attorney General's Office, CUB and the City of Chicago really didn't indicate in any way, shape, or form that there were any new facts or that there were any facts in error. So again we believe the Commission's decision was very sound, well thought through, and supported by a significant body of evidence.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And are you guys going to give out any 2015 consolidated guidance?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No. Nope. I really think it's kind of meaningless, to be honest with you. And the accounting noise around the second half of 2015 with the adjustments, et cetera, I think it would just make your head swim. To me the most important thing is: are we delivering what we said we would from the acquisition, which is growth over and above our 4% to 6% standalone growth. And what was our basis for starting? And that's the 2015 midpoint of $2.72 a share standalone.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Well, then let me ask you this question.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","If you raise the number 6% to 8% 2016 versus standalone, what prevents you from going 6% to 8% in say, 2017 and beyond?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, what would prevent us from doing that? First of all we'd have to have a plan that we would be comfortable with that would produce a 6% to 8%. And at this point in time, 29 days in, this is what we feel comfortable with and what we believe we can deliver.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. So wait for EEI is what you're saying?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I wouldn't expect that you're going to see an earnings guidance change at EEI. What you will see, though, is much more granular detail on our capital spending plans that drive the earnings growth.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Great, okay. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You are welcome Jim.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.

Next time you will be wonderful and award-winning.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Right, right. Just real quickly, what is the upcoming general rate case strategy and timing for the Wisconsin utility subs?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay. Well, for Wisconsin Electric if you recall we just completed our rate case last December, so our rates with future looking test years are set for 2015 and 2016. So under the normal course with the Wisconsin Commission really liking its utilities to file for a case every two years, under the normal course we would file for Wisconsin Electric in the spring of 2016 for rates that would go into effect January 1 of 2017. So that is Wisconsin Electric. Same thing applies for Wisconsin Gas. For Wisconsin Public Service, they are actually in the midst of a rate case right now, and we would expect a rate case decision as usual from the Wisconsin Commission by November or December of this year.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Got it. Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay. Thank you, Brian.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hello, Andy, how are you?","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Research","Wonderful and award-winning.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","All right. Rock 'n roll. You haven't seen the lion down there, have you?","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Research","No, not yet. We are in Chicago so he hasn't come down our way yet.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay. Well be careful.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Research","Just a real quick maintenance question. In terms of rate case earnings benefits in the latter half of the year, should they be similar to the $24 million in the first half? Or first quarter was a little bit higher than the second quarter?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","In terms of the Wisconsin Electric rate case benefits, guys, no? Okay, Steve, we will ask you to cover that.","Stephen P. Dickson - VP & Controller, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So you are referring during the earnings package we've got for the quarter rate case netted to $9.5 million. And what that represents is going into the rate case last year when the rates were set effective January 1, the Wisconsin Commission assumed a certain level of SSR revenues. And what has happened is that the SSR, we reached an agreement with the State of Michigan and those stopped. But in the Wisconsin rate case we are allowed to have the incremental revenues associated with that.","So if you remember last year in the SSRs, the first half of the year the SSRs were based on the suspension. And then later in the year it went to the retirement SSRs. And so the dollar amount was greater in the latter part of the year. So the short answer is you will not see this big a benefit in the last part of the year, but you'll see a little bit of benefit. Does that make sense?","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Research","Yeah, I think so. I might follow-up off-line, but that's all I had. Thank you.","Gale E.

Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're more than welcome.","J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your last question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Last but not least, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","How you doing?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","All right. You mentioned that there were going to be some substantial accounting adjustments in the second half of the year. I was just wondering if you could just give us a little bit of a preview what you are expecting to happen there?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sure. And I will ask Steve Dickson, our controller, and Scott Lauber, our treasurer, if they have anything to add. But essentially as you know, in any acquisition \u2013 we're not immune from this \u2013 one of the things that has to be done is purchase price adjustments. Generally you get a year to do that.","But when you close this early in the year the SEC would like you to button down many of the purchase price adjustments of the time of the filing of the 10-K, which would be early, early next year. So one of the major amount of accounting work that has to be done is all the purchase price adjustment work. Then I'm certain there will be some one-time transition type costs, and there's a whole slew of different types of costs that would be one-time costs that we would incur in the second half of this year.","For example, we want to get an improvement in call center responsiveness for a number of the Integrys utilities; there will be some one-time costs to that. Pat tells me that there are software licensing costs that we will incur that would be one-time nonrecurring in the second half of this year. We could go on with a list of 30 or 40 of these things that are all transition costs that would be non-recurring. But that gives you a flavor. Steve, would you like to add anything?","Stephen P. Dickson - VP & Controller, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. The only thing I'll add, I think you nailed the transition related costs. And I'll go back to the previous question, is we will report GAAP costs at the end of the year; but then as Pat mentioned, we're going to strip out. We're going to make an accounting adjustment to strip off the Integ (58:22) earnings, we're going to strip off the acquisition debt, we're going to strip off the additional shares associated with that to get back to the WEC standalone.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Just to follow-up on this, though, so it sounds like there's going to be a lot of charges. Do we have any sense as to what the quantity of those one-timers is going to be?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Not yet.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We'll certainly have a much better feel for that when we see you at the EEI Conference, but not yet. We are, again, 29 days into this. We know there will probably be a number of charges, and we will be working on it.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Then in terms of purchase accounting, sometimes that has an impact going forward, and some companies strip out those impacts depending on how they are, and sometimes they aren't. Do you guys have any feel as to how the purchase accounting might affect growth going forward? And is there any impact associated with purchase accounting that's in your 2016 and beyond expectations for earnings growth?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, first of all, I don't think we know the answer to that completely yet. But there is one element, because we have regulated operations and more than 99% of our earnings are coming from regulated operations, but in general terms when you value regulated assets they come over onto your balance sheet at carrying value, at rate based value, if I'm making any sense to you. So that actually simplifies a great deal the purchase accounting.","However, there are other things that we have to take a hard look at, like the value of some of the solar assets that Integrys has retained; like the value of a company called Trillium, which is a compressed natural gas fueling station company. So there are other assets. I think there's a waste-to-energy plant in Texas that they had. There are several of these assets that we're going to have to take a hard look at and give an appropriate value to. But in terms of major impact on 2016 earnings growth and beyond, Steve, I don't see any, do you?","Stephen P. Dickson - VP & Controller, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, you nailed it.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","No, I would've thought it until you guys brought it up. And I mean, I think it probably would have been different if Integrys had kept the retail business.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Oh, gosh, very different, very different. Remember, that was part of the announcement, that that did not fit with our model going forward.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right. So just to make sure I understand, basically your earnings growth doesn't have really any major assumptions associated with purchase accounting one way or the other in it?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer, WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You are correct. You are absolutely correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Thanks a lot.","Gale E.

As you recall, our second expansion unit at Oak Creek began commercial service in January of 2011.","We also recorded equity AFUDC related to the Air Quality Control upgrade at our older Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills Wind Park. Overall, we\u2019re very pleased with our financial and operational performance in 2011. We exceeded our customer satisfaction goals. We achieved the best safety record in the history of the company and we were named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the seventh time in the past 10 years.","Turning now to the economy of Wisconsin\u2019s area, Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate at 7.1% remains well below the national average. And after nearly a double-digit rebound in 2010, electric sales to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by three-tenths of a percent in 2011. The demand destruction that we saw from five large plant closings during recession is now being largely offset by modest growth and recovery in other sectors of the region\u2019s economy. For example, we continue to see strength in specialty steel and metal fabrication, paper and printing and industrial machine rate.","Now I\u2019d like to update you on three of our significant construction projects, the 50-megawatt biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin, the Glacier Hills Wind project, northeast of Madison and the air quality control upgrade of the original Oak Creek units. We\u2019re making and I\u2019m pleased to say excellent progress on the biomass plant in Rothschild, Wisconsin. The foundations for the boiler and fuel storage buildings are now complete, and we\u2019re well underway on steel erection for the boiler and the fuel storage facility. As I\u2019ve noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our renewable energy portfolio. We\u2019ll be able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will be used to produce steam for the paper mill will clearly enhance the economics of the project.","Our investment in the biomass plan is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million, excluding AFUDC. We\u2019re on schedule and on budget to meet the completion date by the end of 2013. I\u2019m also pleased to report that on December 20, 2011, the Glacier Hills Wind Park was placed in the commercial service. Glacier Hills is 162-megawatt energy center located on more than 15,000 acres of rolling farm land about 45 miles Northeast of Madison. It is the largest wind farm in Wisconsin.","The completion of Glacier Hills is on time and actually better than budget. It was achieved largely through the talents of Wisconsin labor and Wisconsin companies. When all the costs are finalized, we expect the project to come in below the target of $363.7 million that was set by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission. The $363 million target does not include allowance for funds used during construction or reimbursable transmission costs. Of course, the biomass project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park are key components that will help us meet Wisconsin\u2019s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015.","To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity produced by renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a state-wide level. The standard then sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using a historical baseline. Using that baseline, approximately 8.27% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewables in 2015.","When we complete the biomass project, we will be well-positioned to meet that 2015 standard. I should point out, however, that we expect to deplete our bank of renewal credits, and as a result, we project a need for additional credits or renewable generation by the year 2017.","Finally, we\u2019re nearing completion of the air quality control upgrade for the original coal-fired units at Oak Creek. These four units are among the most efficient base load units anywhere in the Midwest. So the economic solution for our customers was to invest approximately $900 million, including allowance for funds used during construction, for the installation of wet scrubbers and selective catalytic reduction facilities. Overall, the project spans today at about 94% complete.","The tie-in work for Unit 5 has been sufficient and tuning and testing of the equipment is well underway. The tie-in outage for Unit 6 began in early January, and the tie-in work for Unit 7 and Unit 8 are on schedule for the spring. We expect the newer quality controls to be fully operational this year and we remain on budget, again at a cost of approximately $900 million. This is the second largest construction project in our history.","Now, I would like to briefly review where we stand on the regulatory on Wisconsin and Michigan. We\u2019re pleased that there will be no increase in rates for electric customers in Wisconsin in 2012 as a result of the actions taken by the Wisconsin Commission. As we reported to you on our last call, the Commission in October approved our creative approach to keep base rates flat for customers as the economy here continues to recover. To recap the rate plan approved by the Commission authorizes us to suspend the amortization of $148 million of regulatory assets in 2012. Then the plan authorizes us to recover $148 million of carrying costs and depreciations for the air quality controls at Oak Creek, and the Glacier Hills Wind Park.","And on January 5 of this year, the Commission issued an order for our 2012 fuel plan approving an increase of the fuel costs recovery rate for the year. However, that increase will be offset by a credit \u2013 a credit of $26 million representing proceeds that we received from the settlement of spent fuel litigation with the Department of Energy.","As a result of these two decisions there will be no base rate increase or nor fuel increase for our retail electric customers in Wisconsin in 2012. It\u2019s also important to note that we have the authority to file a full rate case in 2012 for new rates to be effective in January of 2013. We\u2019re finalizing the details of the case now and we expect to file with the Commission in late March.","Turning now to our Michigan operations, you\u2019ll recall that in July of last year we filed a request with the Michigan Public Service Commission for an annual rate increase of $17.5 million. We\u2019re seeking to recover from Michigan customers their pro rata share of renewable generation, environmental controls and cost associated with the second expansion unit at Oak Creek.","In late December, the Commission directed the company to self implement a $5.7 million increase that took effect on January 5. The Commission\u2019s directive also authorized the company to implement a $2.7 million credit, again, of the proceeds we received from our settlement with the Department of Energy.","Applying the credit, the net effect of the interim rate increase for customers in Michigan is $3 million or 1.7%. We expect the Michigan Commission to rule on our entire request by July 5 of this year. In addition, approximately $2 million of renewable costs were included on our Michigan fuel recovery rate that took effect on January 1 of this year. So the total self implementation comes to $7.7 million.","And another important matter, the Environmental Protection Agency, as you\u2019re aware, issued on August 8, its final Cross-State Air Pollution Rule commonly known as CSAPR. Subsequently, a number of parties, including Wisconsin Electric, petitioned the federal court and the EPA to delay the rule to ensure that it would be implemented in a fair and reasonable manner.","In late December, the Court of Appeals in Washington DC staved the CSAPR rules that were scheduled to take effect on January 1. The court noted that petitioners had raised significant questions about potential flaws in the new rules that govern emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. The court indicated that the EPA should continue to administer the Clean Air Interstate Rule, better known as CAIR, pending the resolution of these issues that have been raised. Of course, in light of major investments we\u2019ve made over the past decade in efficient new generation and air quality controls on our older base load units, we believe we\u2019ve very well-positioned to comply with CAIR and with any revised CSAPR rules. We\u2019ll keep you posted as developments occur in the case.","On a related note, in early January, we announced that we\u2019re exploring a potential joint venture opportunity in our Presque Isle power plant in Marquette County, Michigan.","Our partner in this potential joint venture is Wolverine Power Cooperative, a large Michigan-based co-op. Now, given our current base load capacity position, we do not believe that it would be economic for our customers to fund the capital that would be necessary to meet likely new environmental regulations, regulations that would impact the coal-fired units at Presque Isle.","However, Wolverine needs base load capacity. And so, we\u2019re jointly exploring the possibility of Wolverine investing in major new air quality controls at Presque Isle in exchange for an undivided interest in the plant. It had to be clear, if this joint venture moves forward, our ownership of the plant would be reduced, but we would not expect a reduction in rate base.","We believe our customers would see lower operating costs from the plant because Wolverine\u2019s customers would pick up their pro rata share of the cost of running the units. Based on our analysis today, the joint venture would be beneficial to our customers and Wolverine\u2019s customers, but significant work including a full engineering analysis must be performed before we can proceed.","I would add that the proposed joint venture would not materially affect our capital spending budget for the years 2012 through 2016 because we were not planning to add significant air quality controls at Presque Isle. I also would like to emphasize the regardless of the decision about the future of Presque Isle, the electric transmission network that supports the Upper Peninsula of Michigan must be improved, both to maintain reliability and allow for economic growth.","Turning now to other material developments. As we reported in our third quarter 10-Q, the company has been working through a legal issue regarding our cash balance pension plan. In November, we entered into a settlement agreement with plaintiffs , and the court promptly issued a preliminary order approving the settlement.","Our fourth quarter results include a charge of less than $0.04 a share to reflect our final cost for the settlement. We do not expect to incur any additional charges other than minor process-related costs as the settlement is implemented. Finally, I\u2019d like to update you on a recent development concerning accelerated depreciation of the investment and our power to future assets.","In late December, the internal revenue service confirmed that accelerated depreciations can be applied to our recently completed expansion units at the Oak Creek site. Now as a result of this ruling, we expect to see a $285 million cash timing benefit by the end of 2014. In the financial forecast that we provided you and may public in November, we have assumed a $250 million benefit. Now this timing item will not impact the deferred tax balance at our utilities, so this latest development will not affect the rate base of our utilities.","The cash though from accelerated depreciation will help fund the higher level of investment we\u2019re projecting in our five-year capital spending plan. As you know, we\u2019ve identified several important projects, projects that are necessary to upgrade the ageing gas and electric distribution infrastructure across the region. Secondly, we plan to continue reducing our debt levels of the holding company in order to maintain strong investment grade credit ratings and keep our borrowing costs low.","And as you may have seen from our news release a couple of weeks ago, our board has now adopted a revised dividend policy. It calls for us to reach a 60% payout ratio in 2014. That\u2019s one year earlier than previously expected. This new policy should support double digit growth in the dividend in both 2013 and 2014 as we work to achieve a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the electric utility industry. Of course, our board of directors took a major step forward last month by approving for 2012 a dividend increase of 15%, bringing our annual dividend rate to $1.20 a share.","I\u2019d also like to address the status of our share repurchase plan. Essentially, there is no change in our share buyback program. As we previously discussed, the board has authorized a share repurchase plan schedule to run through the end of 2013 that calls for us to buy back up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy Common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions.","Through today, we have repurchased approximately 3.2 million shares at an average purchase price of $30.79 a share. So, in summary, we entered 2012 in excellent condition financially and operationally. The company continues to perform at a high level, and our power to future investments are providing tangible benefits for our customers and our stockholders.","And now with more details on our full year financial performance for 2011 and our outlook for the year ahead, here\u2019s our Chief Financial Officer, Rick Kuester. Rick?","Frederick Kuester","Okay. Thanks, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier, in our 2011 full year earnings \u2013 in 2011, our full year earnings from continued operations were $2.18 a share. I will focus on operating income by segment for the year and then touch on other income statement items. I will also discuss full year cash flows and cover our earning guidance for 2012.","Our consolidated operating income for 2011 was $887 million as compared to $810 million for 2010, an increase of $77 million. Operating income in our utility energy segment totaled $545 million, which is down $19 million from 2010.","Looking at our Utility segment, our electric margins were helped by approximately $14 million because of pricing increases at the wholesale level and also in our Michigan jurisdiction, primarily to recover costs associated with our Power the Future plans. In addition, we saw growth in our electric sales, which added approximately $10 million of operating income. When we look at weather, we estimate that our operating income was reduced by $13 million as compared to the prior year. During 2011, we experienced normal winter weather, which helped our gas business as compared to 2010.","On the electric side, we experienced a hotter than normal summer but 2010 was even warmer. So we actually saw a reduction in our earning due to weather compared to 2010. We also saw increased non-fuel operating and maintenance cost totaling $26 million as we released dollars in our generation business for a terminal overhaul in our distribution business for forestry work and higher Power the Future costs related to our wholesale and Michigan customers. These factors combined with $4 million of other net items resulted in the $19 million decline in utility operating income.","Our operating income in the Non-Utility Energy segment, which includes We Power, came in as expected and was significantly higher than the prior year, primarily because of earnings associated with the second expansion unit at Oak Creek. Unit 2 achieved commercial operation in January of 2011, so there were no earnings associated with that unit in the prior year. We also had a full year of earnings from the first unit as compared to 11 months of earnings in 2010. The result was a favorable impact of approximately $97 million on our 2011 operating income. Taking the changes for these two segments, together along with corporate charges and other miscellaneous items. It brings you to this $77 million increase in operating income for the full year.","During 2011, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled nearly $63 million or $3 million increase over 2010. Other income increased by $23 million, primarily because of higher AFUDC on our Utility Construction projects, including the Air Quality Control System for the older Oak Creek units and the Glacier Hills Wind Park. AFUDC, of course, allows us to accrue a return on these approved utility projects during construction.","Our net interest expense increased by $30 million because of two main factors: first, when the second unit Oak Creek achieved commercial operation, We Power issued $420 million of long-term debt to replace short-term debt that was used to finance the construction of Unit 2; second, once Unit 2 achieved commercial operation, we no longer capitalized on interest on the construction work in progress. Our capitalized interest was almost $26 million lower in 2011 as compared to 2010. While we saw higher interest expense at the We Power level, our holding company interest expense declined as we retired $450 million of 6.5% long-term debt on April 1, 2011.","In addition, we were able to take advantage of the low interest rate environment in September of 2011 when our Wisconsin Electric subsidiary issued 10-year bonds with a coupon rate below 3%. Consolidated income tax expense increased by approximately $14 million because of higher pre-tax earnings offset by slightly lower effective tax rate. The lower effective income tax rate was primarily driven by higher levels of equity AFUDC.","For 2012, we expect our effective tax rate to be between 36% and 37% which is consistent with the expectation of lower equity AFUDC. Our effective tax rate in 2011 was 34%. Combining all of these items brings you to $513 million of net income from continuing operations for full year 2011 or earnings of $2.18 per share.","During 2011, we generated $993 million of cash from operations which is up $183 million from the same period in 2010. Our strong cash flows were driven by higher net income and higher deferred income tax expense primarily as a result of accelerated depreciation rules. We estimated that deferred income taxes had a positive cash impact of $430 million and we\u2019ve created a deferred tax asset which we expect will reduce future cash taxes by $328 million. Our 2011 operating cash flows were reduced by $277 million because of contributions to our qualified benefit claims. No such contributions were made in 2010 and we do not plan to make contributions in 2012.","Our total capital expenditures were approximately $831 million in 2011; about $792 million of this was dedicated to our utility businesses which included the Glacier Hills Wind Project and the air quality control project at the old Oak Creek units. We also paid $242 million in common dividends in 2011 which was an approximate 30% increase over 2010.","Consistent with our dividend announcement in January 2012, we expect to pay approximately $279 million of dividends in 2012. Also, as Gale mentioned, in January, our board approved the plan that calls for us to reach a 60% dividend payout ratio beginning in 2014.","On a GAAP basis, our debt-to-cap was 57.1% as of December 31 and we were at 54.4% on an adjusted basis. These ratios are slightly higher than our December 2010 levels of 56.9% and 54.1% respectively but were better than planned. The adjusted amount treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity. We expect the 2012 ratios to be in line with the 2011 ratios.","Consistent with our past practice, we are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. As we discussed in the past, our board of directors authorized the share repurchase program that allows us to repurchase up to $300 million of our common stock through 2013. As Gale noted through today, we have repurchased approximately $100 million of our common shares and an average price of $30.79 a share.","As shown in our earnings package on our website, our actual 2011 retail sales of electricity decreased 0.5% as compared to hot 2010. On a weather-normalized basis, 2011 retail sales excluding the mine increased 0.4%. This is better than the 0.6% weather-normalized decline we had forecast for 2011. Overall for 2012, we are projecting to see a slight decline of 0.6% in weather-normalized electricity sales including the \u2013 excluding the mines versus normalized 2011 sales. This includes the loss of sales due to two customers installing their own sales generation. Adjusting for this, we project that sales, excluding the mines, will grow by 0.4%.","We also project flat residential sales with low housing starts and continued conservation efforts. We expect to see continued moderate growth in the small commercial and industrial class. And we are forecasting the large commercial and industrial class, excluding the mines, to decline by 2.4% due to the installation of self generation. Excluding those customers and the mines, the large commercial and industrial class is expected to grow by 0.5%.","I will now discuss our earnings guidance for 2012. We estimate our 2012 earnings from continuing operations will be in the range of $2.24 to $2.29 per share. As we look at our businesses, we expect to see growth from our utilities, slight growth at We Power, and lower costs at the corporate level due to reduced interest expense and our share buyback program.","As we look at our utility business, you will remember that the Wisconsin Commission approved our proposal to avoid price increases in 2012 by ceasing the amortization of a $148 million of costs associated with regulatory assets. So we expect to see a reduction in our OEM cost with the one year amortization holiday.","Also, we expect increased depreciation expense and a lower AFUDC when the air quality control project that the older Oak Creek units is placed into service. Due to the rate case decision and the timing of fuel recoveries, we expect that first quarter earnings in 2012 will be in the range of $0.75 to $0.78 per share. This includes the effect of warmer than normal weather in January. Finally, I\u2019d like to reiterate that we are targeting a long-term earnings per share growth rate of 4% to 6%.","With that I\u2019ll turn things back over to, Gale.","Gale Klappa","Rick, thank you very much. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","","Operator","And now we\u2019d like to take your questions. (Operator Instructions) Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please state your question.","Gale Klappa","Hi, Greg, how are you today?","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Hi, good morning, Gale, it\u2019s actually Bill, how are you guys doing?","Gale Klappa","Oh, Bill, hi. We\u2019re good, how about you? What you do with Greg?","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","I think he stepped off for a second. Actually \u2013 so we had a question about your comments on the dividend.","Gale Klappa","Sure.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","And, so I guess, you said you\u2019re pulling for your targeted payout ratio for 60% by 2014 now?","Gale Klappa","Yeah, that\u2019s correct.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Right, and so, and you\u2019re saying that that would imply \u2013","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Hey, Gale, I\u2019m back.","Gale Klappa","There you go.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Yes, so the question is you\u2019ve said that you were targeting a 60% payout ratio by 2014 and that that implied double-digit growth \u2013 percentage growth in the dividend between now and then. Is that an accurate regurgitation of your comment?","Gale Klappa","You done regurgitate well.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay, so we can infer from that, that there\u2019s sort of a minimum level of expected earnings growth over the course of the next two years. If we just do the algebra and what that means in terms of your earnings power?","Gale Klappa","We thought, you might like to do your own math, but you are correct.","Greg Gordon \u2013 ISI Group","Okay. Thank you, Gale.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome, and Bill, thank you.","Operator","Jim Von Riesman with UBS. Please state your question.","Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB","Hi, Gale, good afternoon.","Gale Klappa","Good afternoon, Jim, how are you doing today?","Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB","I\u2019m doing well. Thanks. Couple of question if you don\u2019t mind, the first one is can you just talk about what\u2019s happening in the state politically with this governor Walker recall efforts and if there\u2019s any update in status on the generation buy from the state?","Gale Klappa","Sure, I\u2019ll be happy too Jim. By the way were you out there with Ponsitony Phil this morning?","Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB","No.","Gale Klappa","Well the state political situation. It does certainly appear that we are headed for a recall election. Right now the Government Accountability Board of the state is parsing through approximately 1 million signatures to determine how many of those signatures are valid signatures petitioning a recall. That is going to take some time. And in fact the Government Accountability Board has asked for more time and the court has provided them more time.","So the best guess estimate now is that we would have a recall election sometime between April and June of this year. In the meantime as you can about imagine the airwaves are full of political commercials on both sides. We don\u2019t expect any significant legislation and certainly nothing affecting energy policy to be dealt with or debated over the course of the next few months. And if indeed there is going to be a piece of legislation that would authorize the sale of some of the state-owned power plants that would not occur certainly until the fall.","Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB","Okay. Just a quick order or reference here what\u2019s the threshold for either he stays or he goes in terms of the vote count? Simple majority?","Gale Klappa","Oh no. It\u2019s simple, but yeah, 50% plus one vote.","Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB","Okay. Second question is I guess this is more for Rick. If I heard you correctly you said $3.2 million share buyback roughly at $31 a share or just under that. Is that right?","Frederick Kuester","$30.79.","Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB","Okay. So that\u2019s a $100 million. But the cash flow statement that you released today says you had a decreased in repurchased stock of about $140 million. What\u2019s that $40 million delta?","Gale Klappa","I\u2019ll let Steve Dickson, our controller, go through that, Jim.","Stephen Dickson","Yeah. Thanks, Jim. That item is consistent with item that we\u2019ve had in past years. When stock options are exercised, we take the proceeds of the stock options and then go to the open market and buy back stock. So the delta between $100 million and $140 million is cash that we used to buy back our own shares to satisfy stock options and other stock awards.","Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB","Okay, just double checking. And then last question is in pension. Well, are you prepared to talk about your revised discount rate assumptions or your plan asset recurrence at this point in time?","Gale Klappa","Well, we\u2019ve certainly made then public. Let me state first that we made, as Rick mentioned, the $277 million contribution to our benefit plans during 2011. And when you look at our funding position against our liabilities, we are very, very well-positioned. We\u2019re also quite conservative in terms of our \u2013 at least in terms of our industry, in terms of future asset growth.","Steve, do you want to give a shot?","Stephen Dickson","Also, I think we have a conservative asset mix.","Gale Klappa","Yes.","Frederick Kuester","Overall, we\u2019ve got a very conservative program. Steve, go through the details.","Stephen Dickson","Yeah. We worked with our actuaries to get the year-end discount rate and it\u2019s just 5.05, so that\u2019s what we have the liabilities valued at. As Gale said, our expected return on assets remains the same at 7.25% and then the actual returns were about 2.5% in 2011.","Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB","Okay. I\u2019ll follow-up with you on some other questions after the call.","Frederick Kuester","Okay. Jim, thank you for your call. We appreciate it.","Jim Von Riesman \u2013 USB","Thank you.","Operator","Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please state your question.","Gale Klappa","Rock and roll, Michael. How are you?","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","I\u2019m okay, Gale. You?","Gale Klappa","Yeah. We\u2019re fine. We\u2019re doing well.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Couple of questions. First of all, can you walk us through going forward, so let\u2019s say what\u2019s embedded in your 2012 guidance for cash flow \u2013 for basically deferred tax-related cash flows whether it\u2019s from Oak Creek, whether it\u2019s from PTCs, but those that accrued kind of back to the holding company or the shareholder and don\u2019t necessarily go to a reduction in rate base. I\u2019m probably more thinking about the PTF units than I am about kind of the bonus (inaudible) the utility record (inaudible). But if there\u2019s a way to just quantify how much cash gets upstreamed that is related to deferred taxation?","Stephen Dickson","We\u2019re all thinking about how to make that calculation quickly for you.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","We can \u2013 if that\u2019s a pain, we can follow up offline. My other one is CapEx. You\u2019re \u2013 it seems a little unusual that your CapEx going up but it\u2019s not \u2013 meaning from earlier 2011 guidance ranges.","Stephen Dickson","That is correct.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","But your load growth is pretty like a lot of part to the Midwest relatively versus history.","Stephen Dickson","Correct.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","That strikes me as an unusual dichotomy. And could you through some of the drivers of that?","Stephen Dickson","Sure. I think it\u2019s very \u2013 it\u2019s a good question but a very straightforward answer. The additional CapEx spending, and let\u2019s kind of reset that, our 2011 through 2015 plan called for about $3.4 billion of capital spending. Our 2012 through 2016 plan is about $100 million increase at $3.5 billion. The difference between the two rolling five-year plans, Michael, is really replacement of aging infrastructure. I mean we have, as I mentioned in the past, we have aging underground lines, we have aging power poles, we have aging (inaudible) transformers. So we have got \u2013 we really need to maintain the reliability that our customers have come to rely on and deserve. We need to spend more capital on replacement of aging electric and gas distribution infrastructure. That\u2019s the big difference.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. And how are you guys thinking about O&M next year relative to \u2013 meaning in 2012, I guess that\u2019s this year, relative to 2011 levels?","Gale Klappa","Two answers to that because the second answer is very important to make sure you can follow our financials as we go through the year. First answer is that on an operating basis, we\u2019re projecting our O&M to be basically flat. However, you will see a reduction when we report earnings in the first quarter and subsequent quarters. You\u2019ll actually see a reduction in O&M because of the amortization holiday in the rate case.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","And can you quantify that?","Gale Klappa","$148 million.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay. It\u2019s the full amount. Okay. So we should look, think about $148 million year-over-year reduction in O&M? No. No, actually, that\u2019s not true. That\u2019s right. I got it. I\u2019ll follow up. Colleen and I touched on it this morning.","Gale Klappa","All right.","Operator","Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates, please proceed with your question.","Gale Klappa","Good afternoon, Paul. How are you doing?","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Hey, how are you doing?","Gale Klappa","Pretty good.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","A couple of questions has been asked and answered, but just wanted to touch basically on the rate base growth and just a question that Michael asked about the weak anemic growth. I mean, how do you guys see customer rates? I know you guys are focused on keeping them as controlled as possible. Going forward, with this CapEx build-out and with this anemic growth kind of a concern that you have to sort of do this CapEx adjustment and there doesn\u2019t seem to be that much growth.","Gale Klappa","Paul, one more time. I\u2019m not sure I actually follow \u2013","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. You guys have a considerable amount of CapEx that you\u2019re going to have to \u2013 I mean, in terms of replacing the aging infrastructure.","Gale Klappa","That is correct.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And it sounds like sales growth is in all that robust.","Gale Klappa","That is correct.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","And so, I\u2019m wondering \u2013 I know that you guys are very proactive in keeping weights as manageable as possible \u2013","Gale Klappa","Right.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates"," \u2013 but at just how should we think about the rate trajectory fuel excluded going forward?","Gale Klappa","Well it\u2019s a good question and I appreciate the clarification. First of all, for 20 rates that would going to affect in 2013, if you recall we basically have deferred a rate case for a year and I mentioned our customers will see no increase either in fuel costs or in base electric rates during 2012.","But that deferral for a year means that we have put off a rate increase request that is largely driven by capital we\u2019ve already spent on important projects that either our coming into the service now or already in service.","We have three major projects that will be the drivers of our 2012 rate request for 2013 and that\u2019s the quality control, the $900 million that we\u2019re spending on the air quality control upgrade of the older Oak Creek units, the Glacier Hills Wind Park and then the ongoing construction costs at the Rothschild Biomass Plant that would come into service in late 2013.","So, those three factors, those major construction projects all approved by the Commission will be big drivers for our 2012 rate filing for 2013 rates. And that will be obviously a sizeable rate increase with the filing that we\u2019ll make this spring. Beyond that, I would think we would be looking at 3% to 4%, 3% to 5% something in that range. But we would hope 3% or 4% base rate increase is absent fuel going forward once we get this rate increase behind us.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. And just the magnitude of the rate increase that we\u2019re looking at for 2013 potentially or is it too early to say considering that you haven\u2019t \u2013 too early to process to \u2013","Gale Klappa","No. We\u2019re finalizing the details of that case now and it would probably be in the neighborhood of 6%to 7%.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay.","Stephen Dickson","And we said it\u2019s going to be in the same neighborhood as the -what we\u2019ve thought for last year was in that \u2013","Gale Klappa","Right.","Stephen Dickson","\u2013 6% to 7%.","Gale Klappa","I think last year, our filing was 6.6%.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Right.","Gale Klappa","But okay, if we had a traditional case, it would be that amount. But we will put this off for a year.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","I got you. And then also you mentioned self-generation and if you could just maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the customers and if that\u2019s a unique situation or what sort of driving that?","Gale Klappa","I don\u2019t see it being a widespread situation at all. One is a \u2013 one of the organizations that is moving a bit towards self-generation is a sewage \u2013 Metropolitan Sewerage District and the other is a paper mill.","Stephen Dickson","One using landfill gas which is \u2013","Gale Klappa","Right.","Stephen Dickson","\u2013 there\u2019s limited availability on that and the other paper mill is just a biomass project. So I think they\u2019re fairly unique as Gale says.","Paul Patterson \u2013 Glenrock Associates","Okay. Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Gale Klappa","Good questions, Paul. Thank you.","Operator","Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc, you may proceed with your question.","Gale Klappa","Hi, Paul. How are you?","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Good afternoon.","Gale Klappa","How are you doing?","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","I\u2019m well, thank you.","Gale Klappa","Good.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","A question, a follow-up on Jim Von Riesman\u2019s question about the discrepancy on the buyback versus $140 million on the cash flow statement. So you get this $40 million in and then you spend it on buybacks. Where does it show up coming in on the cash flow statement?","Gale Klappa","I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re describing that quite accurately. We are \u2013 remember that we are using cash. Forget about the buybacks for a minute, we have historically hear ever since our management team has been in place. We have used cash to satisfy company obligations related to stock option exercises, 401(k) plans, other stock grants that might be made during the course of the year. So you really have to look at two pieces, the dollar spent on share buyback and then what the amounts were related to those plans. Steve?","Stephen Dickson","Yeah. Just to add on to that, we haven\u2019t released the 2011 (k) but if you go back to the 2010 (k) on our cash flow statement, we break out these two items. On our cash post statement for 2010, we received cash proceeds of $91 million from people exercising stock options. So we\u2019ve got the $91 million and that was cash flows coming in. And then we repurchased the stock on the open market and that was $156 million. So last year, we were net out $66 million. Do you understand?","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Understood. Thank you very much.","Stephen Dickson","You\u2019re welcome.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","And then on your 2012 guidance, what\u2019s your assumption with regards to over or under recovery of fuel?","Gale Klappa","I believe in our 2012 guidance, we\u2019re still assuming some modest under recovery of fuel.","Stephen Dickson","Correct.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","And then lastly, relative to guidance at the end of the third quarter, I think weather was probably more mild than you expected then you had this for $0.04 pension settlement \u2013","Stephen Dickson","Right.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Yet lose at the top end of gains.","Stephen Dickson","Is there a question there?","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","A question and a statement.","Gale Klappa","Well, I\u2019ll take your congratulations and I appreciate that. Well, one of the things \u2013 I mean obviously we had continued effective cost control across the company. Weather did hurt us in the fourth quarter by about $0.04 of share, but the big drivers for the fourth quarter were really the equity AFUDC that we continue to accrue related to the major projects. The fact that we had full quarter of Oak Creek II where we did not, I mean, Oak Creek II was not in service during fourth quarter of 2010. And then weather was a negative factor.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","But you would have known about it, AFUDC in Oak Creek, correct?","Gale Klappa","Yeah, that\u2019s correct. Yes, we knew about the AFUDC in Oak Creek and Glacier Hills. And as we say it, we had very effective cost controls across the company.","Paul Ridzon \u2013 KeyBanc","Okay. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities. Great, please state your question.","Gale Klappa","How are you doing, Jay?","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Hey, very well, Gale. I was hoping we went through a lot of this but hoping we could drill down a little bit into some of the residential trends you\u2019re seeing and appreciate this weather makes it a little difficult to look through this particularly in the quarter. But if we look at the full year, is there more energy efficiency? Is this just austerity? I guess what I\u2019m trying get at from your internal projections, the economy \u2013 if the economy accelerates, would you anticipate recovery in your Residential segment?","Gale Klappa","It\u2019s very hard to tell. We don\u2019t have enough good data in my mind to be able to say concretely what really is driving the residential class. I have a theory that could be wrong, and that is the limitations of weather normalization techniques. And we had a very, very unusually warm summer in 2010. We had another warm but not as warm summer in 2011, both summers above normal. So the numbers we\u2019re reporting to you in essence are weather-normalized data. I still have some concern about the limitations, just of the weather-normalization techniques and the impact that that\u2019s having on our reported data.","If we have normal summer this year, I know it\u2019s hard as all it gets out. But if we have a normal summer this year, I think we\u2019ll be able to tell much better what\u2019s going on. There is no question and I\u2019ve mentioned this to you before, there\u2019s no question that in shoulder months when it is easy to conserve, we are definitely seeing more conservation. We are not seeing more conservation when it\u2019s 95 degrees on the lake front or when it\u2019s 20 degrees below.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Got you. But so I understand your suggestion is the weather normalization calculation is understating what is otherwise or weather normalized growth?","Gale Klappa","That is my theory and we\u2019ll have to wait for more data to prove whether I\u2019m right or wrong. Now for what it\u2019s worth, another reason why I have some confidence in that theory is that we are seeing better than expected growth in small commercial.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Got you. Okay. And then Rick on HoldCo interest, how should we think about the balancing act of retiring common stock and the growing dividend and your desire to reduce HoldCo debt over time?","Frederick Kuester","Yeah. It\u2019s obviously it\u2019s one of the key priorities we got in terms of uses of cash, Jay. What we will look at is the economics of retiring HoldCo debt. We\u2019ve got some 20 33s out there that right would not be economic. We will continue to look at that I would say were probably a couple of used app made big movement right now.","Gale Klappa","And Jay just \u2013 Rick is absolutely right. Just to add on the that. You know our whole theory and practice here is invest in solid utility projects that are needed for the region, maintain our credit metrics which means we continue de-lever a bit. And then if there\u2019s extra cash, use that cash in the way that best benefits shareholders from an after-tax return standpoint. So that\u2019s kind of our \u2013 I mean that\u2019s our whole approach to the next several years.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Nope. That\u2019s perfect. I appreciate it. And then last question, Gale, I know it\u2019s a little off in the future but you indicated the need for some incremental renewable capacity by the 2017 timeframe and assuming that was a decision in 2015 and you had to make it today. Is that biomass? Is that wind? Is that some other relative? What would it be?","Gale Klappa","Well, given today\u2019s market, if the market today were the same when we faced the decision in 2015 or 2016, we would probably buy renewable credits \u2013","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Perfect.","Gale Klappa","\u2013 for the short term.","Jay Dobson \u2013 Wunderlich Securities","Absolutely, great. Thanks so much. I appreciate the help.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome, Jay.

How are you?","Gale Klappa","I\u2019m well.","Unidentified Analyst","Most of my questions have been answered but kind of just one follow-up clarification on your earnings guidance. You incorporate warmer than normal weather in your first quarter 75 to 78 range. Is that incorporated into your full year while you\u2019re using normal annualized growth from February to December then?","Gale Klappa","The answer is yes.","Frederick Kuester","Yes, yes.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. That\u2019s all I have. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome, Andy.","Operator","Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin, please proceed with your question.","Gale Klappa","Okay, Dan. I got to ask you, they were trying to redact some signatures before the petitions went public on the recall. Were they trying to redact your name off there?","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","No comment.","Gale Klappa","Good afternoon, Dan.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","Good afternoon. First of all, I was just wondering if you could clarify again what the 2012 CapEx plan\u2019s going to be.","Gale Klappa","Sure. Rick has the breakdown for you actually.","Frederick Kuester","Yeah, Dan. This is on our website but on page 12 of the analyst presentation, we break out our CapEx for 2012. About $705 million is what\u2019s in the budget. Of that, about $70 million is tied to environmental and that\u2019s finishing up the air quality controls \u2013 primarily finishing up the air quality controls at the older Oak Creek units. Renewables, $161 million which is tied to the biomass project and maybe a few dollars associated with Glacier Hills. And the rest, which is about $475 million is just base capital spend, pipe, poles, wires.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","Okay. Given the CapEx and the dividend increase and share buybacks and no pension payments and all of those moving parts, what\u2019s the financing plan for 2012?","Frederick Kuester","I think we\u2019ve got one offering sometime this year at the utility of $250 million-ish, roughly, Dan.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","And do you have a quarter when that\u2019s likely to be set, quarter?","Gale Klappa","We haven\u2019t set a date yet. Yeah.","Frederick Kuester","We haven\u2019t set a date yet.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","Okay.","Gale Klappa","And no equity issuances, obviously.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","Right. And then I was just curious about that looking at the electric utility revenues, the wholesale, resale, and other revenues were up fairly big on a percentage basis. Just some color on what\u2019s going on there and what to expect going forward?","Frederick Kuester","Sure. We\u2019ll let Allen Leverett, who heads our generation business cover that with you, Dan.","Allen Leverett","And, Dan, there are really two categories there. There\u2019s wholesale and then there\u2019s sales for resale. On the wholesale side, we had a 50-megawatt contract with a large co-op here in Wisconsin that we began providing service under that contract. I think it began June 1 of last year. And then we also made some additional sales to a co-op up in the UP of Michigan, so those two together, Dan, increased our wholesale sales about $17.5 million. So that\u2019s two contracts together.","In addition on the sales for resale and it\u2019s probably the easiest way to think about those, Dan, those are spot sales. So those are sales that you would make on the spot market, it\u2019s micro as opposed to the term market. In 2010, we purchased about 0.03 million megawatt hours from the micro market, whereas in 2011 we sold 1.3 million megawatt hours. So we had a swing of 1.6 million megawatt hours. And the reason that we were able to make those sales is largely because we had the Oak Creek expansion, the second unit of Oak Creek expansion that was available in 2011 and of course it was not available in 2010 because it hasn\u2019t been completed yet.","So hopefully that gives you a little bit of color about these line items.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","So what\u2019s the term of those wholesale contracts with the co-ops?","Allen Leverett","The contract to the Wisconsin co-op is a 10-year contract. The contract with the Michigan co-op was a contract we already had in place, but their take under that contract was a bit more. I think the original term on that contract, Dan, I think we\u2019re into the third year of the contract. The original term of that contract I believe was 25 years. So it was a very longer term contract.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","Okay. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","Take care, Dan.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin","You too.","Operator","Andrew Levi with Caris, please state your question.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","Hi.","Gale Klappa","Did you get the hat, Andy?","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","Yes, thank you, Gale. My son loved it. So, thank you very much.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","You said it was one of the good ones.","Gale Klappa","I\u2019m glad to hear that because it was painful buying it.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","Well, it is what it is, but we\u2019ll see what happens this weekend.","Gale Klappa","Yeah.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","But thank you again.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","Do you guys say there was slide package on your website?","Gale Klappa","We do. We have a slide package on the website at www.wisconsinenergy.com.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","I can\u2019t find it. Okay, I\u2019ll work on that. And then the only other question I had, weather-wise for the year 2011, how much of that affect your earnings?","Gale Klappa","Rick, it certainly hurt earnings overall.","Frederick Kuester","Yeah, we were \u2013 in health gas, gas was up slightly but it was offset by electrical sales about $0.03 a share, electrical expense $0.06 per share. Gas was up $0.03 a share.","Gale Klappa","So negative $0.03.","Frederick Kuester","As compared to 2010.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","On this, I wanted verse normal anything \u2013 any of that?","Frederick Kuester","Steve\u2019s got that on normalize, yeah.","Stephen Dickson","Yeah, basically, it was close to normal year. The heating degree days for gas were right here, the 20 degree \u2013 20 year average. So gas was basically a push. And it was a hot summer, but it got warm in the fourth quarter. So, on an operating income \u2013 or excuse me, margin basis, there was only $6 million. So weather was basically a push this year.","Gale Klappa","Against normal.","Stephen Dickson","Against normal.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","And then just looking at the OEM number which was obviously down quite a bit. Is that sustainable going into 2012?","Frederick Kuester","Well, we\u2019ll look at it, Steve, because there\u2019s some accounting changes that affect the way you look at those numbers for 2011 and then I\u2019ll be happy to talk about 2012, Steve?","Stephen Dickson","Andy, the reduction in OEM on a year-to-year basis and we talked about this in the first and second quarter. It has to do with the elimination of the intercompany revenues and expenses related to the Power the Future leases. And so the impact because unit two, went into service we eliminated more revenue and that was about $98 million year-to-year difference. So, our consolidated OEM is down $98 million because of the elimination entry, I\u2019d like Gale address the other issue.","Gale Klappa","And that this is the last quarter we\u2019re going to see \u2013","Frederick Kuester","Right.","Gale Klappa","This whole had to do with the Power the Future assets coming into service. Now for 2012 and I may have mentioned this but it\u2019s worth repeating because it can be confusing if you don\u2019t follow this every day. For 2012, on a pure operating basis our OEM is projected roughly flat, however, when you see our financial reports each quarter you\u2019ll actually see a decline in overall OEM because of the rate plan which caused for us to cease amortization over the course of 2012 of 148.1 million of regulatory assets. So everyone should keep that in mind but in terms of just the trend of real OEM from real operations 2012 we expect to be flat.","Andrew Levi \u2013 Caris","Thank you.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome, Andy.","Operator","Ted Hayden with Point State Capital, you may proceed with your question.","Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital","Good afternoon.","Gale Klappa","Hi Ted.

So appreciate the time, I had just one quick question on 2011. What was your earned ROE at Webco?","Gale Klappa","If you remember our allowed ROE at the electric side of the business is 10.4. Our allowed ROE on the natural gas distribution side of the business is 10.5 and if you look overall, we were very, very close to our allowed ROE.","Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital","And is that on the 6 billion of rate base that you guys have in your December slide deck?","Gale Klappa","We are looking here. Yes.","Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital","Okay. And the equity ratio is like 53? It\u2019s a sliding scale I guess, right?","Gale Klappa","Pat, we had 52.2%, 53% up in utilities?","Patrick Keyes","53.5 is the high end. We were underneath that.","Frederick Kuester","Midpoint is 51.","Gale Klappa","Yeah, our allowed range is 51% to 53.5%. As Pat said we were just under the 53.5%.","Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital","Got you. Okay and then I\u2019m assuming the guidance for 2012 assumes the 10.4, 10.5 blended as well?","Gale Klappa","Well it assumes we can come close.","Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital","Come close? Okay so maybe a little bit of lag?","Gale Klappa","Yes.","Ted Hayden \u2013 Point State Capital","Okay. Great. That was it. Thanks a lot.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re more than welcome Ted.","Operator","Your final question will come from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Gale Klappa","Welcome back Michael.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Hey Gale. I want \u2013 if you don\u2019t mind come back to the CapEx question and you talked the 2011 to 2015 and then the 2012 to 2016, 3.4 billion and the 3.5 billion. I\u2019m just a little confused only because you spent a lot of money on South Oak Creek in 2011 if I remember correctly. But South Oak Creek CapEx kind of stopped soon. I mean, you\u2019re mostly done with that and have done well with getting that project wrapped up on time on budget. So it seems like if I look at the CapEx, you\u2019re replacing a large chunk of CapEx in 2011 tied to South Oak Creek with a lot of reliability and infrastructure. I mean, that\u2019s not a small number. And I just want to see and check to make sure I\u2019m understanding that correctly not making a mistake in kind of thinking about the timeline for when you spent dollars on South Oak Creek.","Gale Klappa","Very good question. And let me break it down for you. Rick and I have got a slide here which really, I think, details it quite well. You are correct. We are virtually complete with our spending on the South Oak Creek air quality control upgrade, and that is a very large project. When you look at our estimated 2011 spending on our rate-based infrastructure, it was about $420 million.","For 2012, it\u2019s about a $50 million increase. We\u2019re projecting to spend $473 million on basic infrastructure work at our utilities, replacing aging gas distribution lines, replacing substation transformers, that kind of stuff. So we\u2019re seeing, compared to 2011, about a $50 million increase in infrastructure spend. Then we\u2019re projecting, as we show on the slides here that you can get on our website too, we\u2019re projecting about $160 million of spending on renewable which is largely, Rick, the Rothschild Biomass Plant.","Frederick Kuester","That\u2019s correct.","Gale Klappa","And then, we have about another $70 million on top of that of environmental spend, environmental CapEx. So that takes you the number Rick mentioned about $705 million of projected capital spend in 2012 in kind of the categories\u2019 breakdown.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. All right, I\u2019m with you guys. One last question, I just wanted to make sure I understood. On the debt side, besides what you do with the utility, is what\u2019s in plan a reduction of HoldCo level interest and the HoldCo level debt or flat?","Frederick Kuester","In 2012, it will be basically flat.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay. Okay, and beyond like how you were thinking about 2013 and beyond?","Frederick Kuester","Yeah, let me rephrase. We did, as I mentioned in the script, we retired $450 million at the HoldCo in April. So there will be effect to that but we won\u2019t be retiring any new debt in 2012. So we\u2019ll have the effective retire net debt back in the last April, Michael.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Frederick Kuester","And Michael, let me go back if I can to maybe help clarify one additional point on the capital spend question you had. With our projection of about $705 million of capital spending in 2012, that\u2019s materially below the actual spend for 2011.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay, I\u2019m just \u2013 it strikes me your \u2013 the way I\u2019m reading it is, come 2013 and 2014, it\u2019s a big jump off in retirement, $400 million a year and reliability spend, kind of core spend because you\u2019re rolling off some of the enviro and some of the renewable spend.","Frederick Kuester","You\u2019re absolutely correct and let me give you the projections. I mentioned $473 million in 2012 on the basic reliability, I mean, the basic core business capital spend. That jumps in our projections to $611 million in 2013 and about $585 million in 2014. So yes, you\u2019re in the right direction with your intuition.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Have seen and then checked this with the PSC.","Frederick Kuester","Oh, we \u2013 let me put it this way, every project of any kind of magnitude. Any project that\u2019s of \u2013 what is our threshold on the electric side guys that we take the commission, $7 million, that was $7 million.","Patrick Keyes","I would say $8 million.","Gale Klappa","$7 million or $8 million.","Patrick Keyes","$8 million, yeah.","Gale Klappa","We have a capital project that is above $7 million or $8 million of capital spend. We historically, in the way regulation has worked here, we take that project for approval \u2013 individual project approval to the commission. And once that project is approved in the 110-year history of regulation in this state, cost recovery for an approved project that you bring in on time and on budget has never been denied.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Okay.","Patrick Keyes","So Michael, if you look at actually what we\u2019re doing \u2013 if you look at the installation history of the company and when a lot of this stuff we\u2019re replacing was installed, look at the age of what we\u2019re replacing, it\u2019s time to be doing this. I mean we\u2019re talking 50-year-old transformers. We\u2019re talking poles that are in excess of 60 years old. We\u2019re talking upgrading of the gas pipelines, putting better material in. So this is infrastructure improvement that needs to be made based on material conditions out there.","Gale Klappa","We have equipment here older than Mr. Goldman or Mr. Sachs.","Michael Lapides \u2013 Goldman Sachs","Understood.

A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Now, as you saw this morning, we recorded first quarter earnings per share of $1.12, which is ahead of our guidance. Effective cost controls, better than forecasted electric fuel recoveries and the decoupling mechanisms at our Illinois and Minnesota gas utilities help to more than offset the very warm weather in the first quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment. We are affirming our guidance for 2017 in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, and this is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.","Now I would like to update you on several developments on the regulatory front. On April 4, we filed the proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Due to the terms of the settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018, as well as 2019. This will make for a total of four years that base rates will be flat.","This would essentially give our customers price certainty through 2019, and require us to continue to manage our cost aggressively. Under the proposed agreement, the current earning sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place in 2018 at Wisconsin Public Service for two years.","Similar to Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas, this mechanism would provide for equal sharing between shareholders and customers of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services allowed return on the equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% will go back to benefit customers.","We have the support of a broad cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. Currently, 24 customers including three of our largest customers have signed the settlement agreement. We've also briefed legislative leaders and they have been supportive. As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses and create more than 2,000 jobs.","These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under the current terms. The Commission formerly began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 28. Now, settlements are uncommon in Wisconsin, but at this point, I expect the process to move expeditiously.","I also want to note that our proposed $230 million investment in natural gas storage for our Wisconsin utilities is progressing through the regulatory process. In March, the Wisconsin Commission agreed to consider the merits of our petition for declaratory ruling on the reasonableness and prudence of this investment. Under the schedule set by the administrative law judge, the matter will be ready for the Commission to consider and decide on June 1.","Our acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding will provide approximately one-third of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin natural gas distribution companies. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our three natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin.","The earnings from this investment as well as this risk profile are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring a very meaningful benefits to our customers.","In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is also progressing well. We are on track to conclude that process within the 270-day statutory deadline, which ends on October 27.","No substantive issues or concerns have been raised, and we anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval for the project later this year. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project, if approved by the Michigan Commission. As you may recall, our last several major proceedings in Michigan have resulted in settlements which the commission approved. We would welcome a similar outcome in this case.","Turning now to Illinois, we continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. I expect we will invest approximately $300 million this year in this program, all of which I expect will make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Although the program continues as planned, the Illinois Commission is still completing its review of the preferred approach to the program. The commission has requested that the record in the proceeding be developed further before making a final decision. And I expect an order in the fourth quarter.","Finally on the federal regulatory front, you will recall that on September 28, 2016, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder to being a member of MISO, thus increasing its return on equity to 10.82%. We are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level. However, in the second MISO return on equity complaint case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which would bring its return on equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipate transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We have factored this lower return into our long-term financial plan. We are monitoring the appeals of the New England cases for developments that could impact ATC's allowed returns.","Now, just a reminder on our dividend, on January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents the compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.","Now, with some additional details on our first quarter results and financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, who is our Chief Financial Officer.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 first quarter earnings grew to $1.12 per share from $1.09 per share in the first quarter of 2016. Our earnings were driven by effective cost control that more than offset the warmer than normal weather. The weather impact in the quarter is estimated to be approximately $0.04 a share less compared to normal weather. As you recall, our guidance in the first quarter was $1.02 to $1.06 per share. Our guidance already reflected about a $0.02 per share decrease related to the warm January weather.","The continued warm weather in February and normal weather in March was offset by better-than-expected electric fuel recoveries in the quarter due to lower natural gas prices. With the warmer weather, we saw less maintenance in our field operations that allowed us to allocate resources to capital work. In addition, we aggressively managed costs with the continuation of warmer weather. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of first quarter 2017 and first quarter 2016 results.","I'll first focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 6 of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the first quarter of 2017 was $617.3 million as compared to $589.3 million in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $28 million.","Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the first quarter increased $4.8 million from the first quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operations and maintenance expense was $28.4 million lower. This was mostly offset by the mild winter temperatures.","In the first quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized an operating increase of $18.4 million compared to the first quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense, and to a lesser expense continued investment in the gas system modernization program.","The mild weather did not have a significant of an impact on our Illinois margins due to the decoupling in the jurisdiction. Operating income in our other states segment improved $1.6 million due in part to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures and decoupling at our Minnesota operations.","Operating income at the We Power segment was up $4.1 million when compared to first quarter of 2016. This increase reflects the additional investment at our Power the Future plans since the first quarter of 2016.","The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment increased $900,000. Taken the changes of these segments together, we arrived at $28 million increase in the operating income. During the first quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.9 million, an increase of $3.4 million compared to the first quarter of last year.","Other income net decreased by $17 million quarter-over-quarter. Recall that in the first quarter of 2016, we repurchased approximately $155 million of Integrys 6.11% Junior Subordinated Notes at a discount, which contributed approximately $0.04 per share. Interest expense increased $3.8 million quarter-over-quarter, this was primarily due to lower capitalized interest and higher short-term rates.","Our consolidated income tax is relatively flat compared to last year. As a reminder, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38% for 2017. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $18.7 million for the quarter ended March 31st, 2017. A reduction in working capital was partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.","Looking at the cash flow statement on page 5 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $329.7 million in the first quarter, a $17.7 million increased compared to the first quarter of 2016, as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.","Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of March, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of the last year. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","We also paid $104.1 million in common dividends during the first quarter of 2017, an increase of $7.9 million over the first quarter of last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase to the dividend rate compared to the first quarter of 2016.","Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric and 23,000 more natural gas customers than it did the same time a year ago.","Sales volume quarter-over-quarter are showing on the earnings package on page 8, weather normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2017 were slightly above our expectations.","Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share. This projection assumes normal weather for remainder of the year. We are off to a strong start, however, it is early in the year and we have a lot of weather ahead of us.","Finally, we'd like to address the second quarter earnings per share guidance. We expect our second quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.56 to $0.60, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.56 to $0.60 per share.","With that, I'll turn things back to Allen.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. So we'll now begin the question-and-answer period. Operator?","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thank you. Good afternoon.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","A couple of questions. So, the quantum of O&M reduction you saw on the quarter, was that a function of rationing down O&M in the quarter relative to understanding where your margin was coming in? When we look at Q2 versus Q2 O&M or balance of year O&M versus balance of year O&M, how should we think about those numbers going forward? I mean, clearly it would be a huge assumption to use the current base of O&M as a run rate.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Greg, I think as we look at our plan for 2017, our plan was to bring O&M down 3% in 2017 relative to the actual run rate in 2016, and that's still our plan. But given how extraordinarily warm it was in January and February, we use, what I've talked about before, our flex down process to basically flex down spending to preserve our margins in the phase of the very, very warm weather. So, I think 3% down year-over-year on O&M is still a good assumption sort of on a whether normalized basis, so to speak, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","So if your Q2 through Q4 numbers were to come in and theoretically on the plan, the O&M numbers quarter-over-quarter over for the balance of the year would be in that direction and magnitude?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, yes, the 3%. That's right.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. Got you. Moving down to the WE Power line, you saw $4.1 million improvement in operating income from higher capital investment. How should we think about how those numbers are going to trend over the balance of the year? Is that going to be at a sort of a $16 million improved operating income run rate because of higher capital, or was that for some reason lumpy in the quarter?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It was a little lumpy as we put those projects in, in the storage, the coal storage, and fuel blending. So, overall though, that should continue through the year.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So not in the $4 million run rate, but there will be incremental earnings in each subsequent quarter that approach that increased amount?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, it will be an increased in each of the future quarters compared to the prior year.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That, we just put it in service in January this year at the end of last year.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Can you remind me what the total capital investment was, as you were in sort of a pretty consistent return on investment -","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, it was just under $60 million.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","$60 million. Okay. I have some other questions, I'll go to back in the queue. Thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners. Please go ahead.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, Allen and Scott, how are you?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","How are you?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good. Good.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Is there an update on the Arizona co-op situation, and as well as Alaska? Is there any updates on wires opportunities there right now?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, Shar, those are just maybe a context for the others on the call, those were areas that American Transmission Company was targeting for development kind of outside their traditional footprint. In Arizona, they are working. They are looking at the feasibility of the number of transmission projects. My expectation is later this year. Can't really give you a specific date at this point, but they're actively looking at I think four different projects, and they would be prepared to propose some of those later this year in Arizona. And in Alaska, I don't have any update for you at this point in Alaska.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, got it. And then just on the Arizona, is that incremental to what you have as a placeholder, or would that be supportive of that?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It would be the latter, Shar. So we had $300 million of capital for what we called outside the footprint in the five-year plan. So whatever they propose there would be supportive of that $300 million.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Helpful. And then just lastly, I know obviously with your carbon reduction goals, you've talked about additional coal retirements. Can you sort of just, is there an update on how you're thinking about additional retirements and what the read-through could be for additional O&M savings as well as incremental gas needs?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, there's nothing at least in terms of additional requirements, other than the retirement of Presque Isle we talked about, which is about a 360-megawatt coal unit. We've also talked about the retirement of Pulliam, which is a coal unit in Green Bay in the WPS Service Territory.","So, other than those two retirements, I don't have anything additional to announce. I would tell you though, Shar, if you look at kind of our carbon reduction goal and maybe describe it in terms of annual tons of reduction, so what we ultimately would like to see is about a $14 million annual run rate reduction in CO2, and based on the things that we've already announced, so the Pulliam and Presque Isle, and the things that we've done at our gas plants, you could get roughly $7 million out of that $14 million. So based on what we've already announced, you could get $7 million out of that $14 million, and those actions \u2013 not only would they reduce carbon, but they also would be a net savings to customers.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay, excellent. I'll jump back in the queue. Congrats on the results.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Shar.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Bone with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hey. Good afternoon.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I was just wondering if you could talk about something you discussed last quarter. On the call in response to a question you talked about your capital plan supporting growth in the lower half or towards the lower end of the 5% to 7% range, and I was just wondering if you could remind us if there's a timeframe associated with this growth target, or if it's more indefinite?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So what we've said, and this is something that I've mentioned at least on a couple calls before this one, didn't go into as much detail on it on this call, but we look at a base of earnings in 2015 of $2.72 per share. And, Caroline, basically that $2.72, it effectively, it's like a pro forma number for the company as if we had never done the Integrys acquisition. Okay.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Right.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","So we set that base of earnings at $2.72 in 2015, and what we've said as a long-term matter is sort of think of an envelope where the bottom end of the envelope is a 5% compound annual growth off $2.72, and then 7% is the upper end of the envelope. What we said, as a long-term matter, we expect our actual earnings, the trajectory, to be in that envelope. So that's really how we've laid out our goal.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So it's more of an indefinite kind of through 2020 and beyond type of timeframe than just through 2019?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, I would characterize it as long-term; I'm not sure anything is indefinite, but...","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Fair enough.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","...but it's certainly long term.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. And then just kind of on another note, I was just wondering if you could comment on to what extent earnings sharing mechanisms impacted the Q1 result?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Scott, do you want to address that?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It did not affect the Q1 results at all.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","You said did not?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We weren't into a \u2013 it did not.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Okay. All right. Thanks very much.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hello, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Allen. Thank you, guys, for taking my question. So, when we think about the rest of the year for O&M, because you were down far more than 3% in the first quarter, should we assume a lower decline rate for the rest of the year, or simply that the remaining quarters you kind of stay near that 3% range, so you may actually kind of beat your expectations on O&M management just due to a really good start to the year?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, yeah, my expectation at this point, Michael, and of course, I can't sit here today and say whether it's going to be for the rest of the year, but if you had sort of a normal weather for the rest of the year, I still think for the year, we'd be down 3% on a O&M. We would stick pretty close to that plan, if we had normal weather. If, for some reason, it's warmer or cooler than normal, well, I expect we'd adjust.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Can I ask just a very basic question, when weather impacts O&M, what are the things that change, like when you're sitting around and it's February and we're not having winter, what is that that actually changes versus what you're thinking you are going to do on December 31st, heading into the year versus what you actually do?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, when you think about the weather, there's a couple of things, when you have consecutive warm weather like January was one of the warmest and February was the warmest, we're actually able to just reduce some O&M expenses because the actual number of leaks and coal outs where the frost the line is really \u2013 naturally reduces some O&M. And then, when we see that warm weather, everyone in the company like Allen talked about, we have our flex lists and we react to that and make sure that we can control our cost to offset the weather decline.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thank you. CapEx in the quarter, so if I think about your full year guidance for CapEx of just over $2.1 billion and yet CapEx in the quarter was south of $350 million and you normally wouldn't do a ton on the electric side in the middle of the summer, should we assume this is very back-end loaded this year, or is there something where CapEx could be lower this year and bigger in future years?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, it's the first quarter, so we still have the winter season, so it's not the largest construction for us, unless we're finishing up our prior year project. So, the first quarter isn't the biggest construction, and remember, some of the construction we have and if the \u2013 we talk about including the storage field that we're looking at purchasing, that's in the back half of the year, so it's a little bit back-end loaded.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Okay. And then finally, I know you've got the settlement outstanding, and I just want to make sure I understand what is the Commission's process for reviewing and potentially approving the settlement, and what are the roles that the interveners who did not sign the settlement, what do they play in this process?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay. Well. Let me just maybe as background for everybody, settlements, Michael, are quite uncommon in commission history \u2013 in Wisconsin Commission history. So as a result, there is no prescribed settlement process in Wisconsin. And in some other states, you have some statutorily prescribed process for a settlement, you don't really have that here. So each settlement can be approached maybe in a somewhat different fashion. Sitting here today, I talked about the fact that the PSCW gave official notice of the proposed settlement on April 20. They indicated that they would soon set a date for a prehearing conference, and then if things work the way they usually work, Michael, they'd solicit comments after they do that prehearing conference. And then, they'll have to decide what process they want to use after that.","But I would just reiterate, I mean there is very broad customer support for the settlement. So the 24 industrial customers that I talked about including the three largest customers that we have. Now, in terms of the role that other interveners would have, at this point, it's hard for me to say, and I mean I would assume they'd be like any other party in a contested proceeding. So, they wouldn't be any different than how they typically would be in a contested proceeding. That will be my expectation at least.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. I was just thinking through it because two of the large groups that are normally part of the process weren't signatory to your stipulation. So, just trying to think through how they factor in all of those.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. Well, one of those, and I think you're referring to the two permanent intervener groups. One of those permanent intervener groups is what I think of was a trade association, many of whose members actually individually supported the settlement. And then you've got another permanent intervener group called CUB, which is not really a trade association, but I think their remit is to represent residential customers largely.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it, got it. Thank you, Allen. Much appreciate the insight, guys.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon. Thank you. Congratulations on the quarter.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Any update on the legislation around Power the Future and where does that stand?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. Well, I think where it stands, it was referred to an assembly committee, which of course is the lower house of the legislature, then it was also referred to a senate committee. At this point, there've been no hearings that have been scheduled at a committee level. So, that's where it stands, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you. When does the legislative session end?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Paul, I believe they're in session until at least the end of May, and of course this is a budget year, so I'm not sure they can go home until they have a budget. But I think it's that the end of May, Paul, but we can get you a more precise answer offline.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Is the budget discussion contentious?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I'm not sure, I would just call it any more or less contentious than Wisconsin budgets have been. Unlike other states, they consistently have a budget.","Paul T.

Please go ahead.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi, good afternoon.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Dan.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Yes. My first question kind of relates to the energy sales shown on pages 8 and the bottom of page 7. It looks like the 2017 normalized versus 2016 normalized, you have a nice pickup in the small commercial industrial area...","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. That's correct.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","...particularly in Wisconsin on and then on the gas side. So, I was wondering is that something that we should anticipate it's going to continue, or you could give us a little more color on what's going on there?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sure. Yeah, the small class in our electric sales on a weather normalized basis, we calculate it to be up 1.4%. Now, like we talked about the quarter, it was extremely warm this quarter. So, normalization in this sector and all sectors is pretty tricky, especially when you're talking, with commercial, there is a variety of different commercial operations there. So, the class has always been a little stronger for us. And in our long-term forecast, we have about a 0.5% year here at for next year \u2013 for this coming year. So, it was a good quarter, but once again, it was only one quarter, I'd still look at overall being about 0.5%. And that's what I see in high class.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Then you also mentioned you had a $100 million pension contribution in the first quarter. I was wondering if you could just update us on sort of where you're kind of on pension funding, and should that like satisfy your needs for the next few years or how should we think about that payment?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. So yeah, we evaluate the pension, as you know, every year in March, intensely during the year, it gets us to be about fully funded about a 100% on a GAAP basis. So, we don't see any contributions in the near-term, but of course we'll continue to evaluate.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then, I just wonder if you could update us on the debt financing plans in terms of timing?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sure. So we have a couple debt financing plans this year. One, first, we're looking at putting debt versus intercompany debt down at our Minnesota and Michigan subs. So we're looking at that financing. So that is one item that we'll be doing. Another financing, and that'll probably each be around $100 million each. So those financings we'll be working on this year.","We'll also be looking at \u2013 continue some debt at our gas utility, Peoples Gas, with the continued construction program. So that'll be happening this year also. Of course when we look, at with the purchase of Bluewater, there's potential financing with that also. And then we continue to monitor all the large electric utilities, Wisconsin Electric, Wisconsin Public Service, potentially, one, we'll have to monitor that as we go through the year.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. That's all I have. Thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hi, Allen. So, just on the rate settlement filing, so you mentioned the commission is going to be setting a prehearing; they still have not set the date of that yet?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Steve, to my knowledge at this point, they have not set a date for the prehearing conference.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And how long can this process go before you need to kind of make your normal rate filing?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, my view right now, Steve, would be that I'm going to wait for the commission to take some definitive action, either a definitive action that they approve the settlement or a definitive action that they reject the settlement. I think financially, we're just fine waiting for that definitive answer.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Yeah.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","So we'll wait. As I was saying in the prepared comments, I do think they'll act expeditiously, but there's just no prescribed process, so -","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just in terms of like \u2013 someone asked about other parties \u2013 just I assume you probably talk to other parties. Just do you expect some of them to oppose the settlement or you just got to wait and see what happens?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I think we really have to wait and see what happens. At this point, the interventions, they've raised their hand and intervened, but without even having had the prehearing conference, it's hard to know what their positions are at this point.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. That makes sense. And then I guess just any update you may have given us and I missed it just on the Illinois Gas Infrastructure Investment Program?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. And I did touch on it just briefly, but maybe just as kind of a review and summary. My expectation sitting here today is that we'll deploy about $300 million worth of capital over the course of the entire year on the S&P program. The Illinois Commission has asked for \u2013 going back to the workshop proceedings, remember that they had last year \u2013 they've asked for some additional information, I believe our deadline for filing is the middle part of May for that additional information, and additional briefs. And they've indicated that they would decide this year, so that's where we are with that process. But in the interim, we're continuing with the program, as we laid out in our three-year plan to them.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Leslie Rich with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, Leslie.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Hi, Allen. You said for the quarter that one of the things that had you come in above your guidance with better-than-expected fuel recoveries. Could you just walk through how that -","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. Right, on the electric side. Scott, do you want to talk about and go through that?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sure. So, going into the quarter, we were anticipating that gas prices were a little bit higher. They actually were a little bit higher. And then with the continued \u2013 so we thought the recoveries would be a little bit less about $0.02 worth, and then as the warm weather continued, our natural gas prices went down and, in fact, our fuel recovery at both of the utilities came in slightly better than we anticipated, just because of the price of the electricity on the market and running our plants with the natural gas.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","So does that get trued up over the course of the year?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, you have a fuel band at both of the utilities, so that's the plus or minus 2%, so our outlook at this point, Leslie, would be that given normal weather, we would expect to be about fully recovered at each of the utilities, again for electric fuel.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","But not ahead of plan?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No. At this point, I wouldn't project to be ahead of plan.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Okay.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Or ahead of fully recovered.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Correct. Right.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Right. Right. Right. And then just on the C&I side, frac sand, fracking is starting to pick up again if you've seen, you've done some gas infrastructure in Western Wisconsin in 2014, 2015. I'm just wondering if you're sort of seeing any uptick in activity in that regard?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. We're starting in the first quarter, when you look at first quarter 2017 versus 2016, we are seeing a slight uptick in that frac sanding sector. So, it's nice growth. Remember, frac sanding is, I think when you look at our sales of the gas side in Wisconsin excluding residential, it's between 1.5% and 2% of sales, so it's a nice grouping and we did see a nice little uptick there.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","So just more broadly then on C&I, on the electric side, your mines \u2013 the mining activity was down pretty heavily, was that the iron ore mines?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. That is correct. So, those are the iron ore mines that \u2013 that's what we look at with and without those.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Right, okay. And then just broadly speaking the rest of the C&I business on the electric side across your jurisdictions is roughly flat on a weather normal basis?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. The large C&I, that has been relatively flat just \u2013 once again the economy is \u2013 it's moving a little bit, but those sales have been very flat in the last several months, quarters.","Leslie Best Rich - JPMorgan Investment Management, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Leslie.","Operator","Your next question is a follow-up from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","The iron ore mines, are these the mines that are going to eventually close and they're just kind of ramping down here, which mines are these?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, there are the two large mines in the UP of Michigan. So, these are the Cliffs Resources mines. So, Paul, and I always mix up the names, but one of the mines is roughly a third of the usage up there, and that's the one if you remembering is going down into shutdown. The other mine which is about two-thirds, which is the Tilden mine, that's the larger of the two and that's the one at least the Cliffs has indicated that they're going to run for the long term.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Is it the impact we are seeing now is the one that's permanently closing?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Correct. Correct. I think that actually was closing last fall, previously, it was shut down \u2013 I think it's actually closed now.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And the Tilden never scaled back operations and they're going to ramp and back up another sales recovery and what's the dynamic there?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, I think and I didn't listen to their call, their earnings call, but my understanding at least is, if they see an uptick in demand, could they sell to steel mills obviously, if they see an uptick there, they would be poised to increase production, but otherwise, I think they're going to be pretty flat, would be my expectation.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","All right. Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Thank you. We have no additional questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Allen Leverett for closing remarks.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, operator. Well, thank you all for joining us today.

Henderson","Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. Thank you for waiting and welcome to Wisconsin Energy\u2019s Conference Call to review 2012 Third Quarter Results. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on Management\u2019s expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the Company\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale E. Klappa","Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us as we review the Company\u2019s 2012 third quarter results. And for all of you dialing in from the East coast, we hope that you and your family are safe and coping well with the aftermath of hurricane Sandy.","Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of WE Generation; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Assistant Treasurer.","Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $0.67 a share for the third quarter of 2012. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $0.55 a share for the third quarter of 2011. The weather of course has been a major story throughout this year. We began 2012 with a warmest winter in the 122 years. That was followed by an old fashion heat way of the summer. The hottest day in Milwaukee this year was on July 5, when the temperature reached 103 degrees.","I\u2019m pleased to report to you that our generating fleet performed very well. We were able to meet the strong customer demand for energy, thanks to the $3 billion we\u2019ve invested over the past decade in new efficient generating units through our Power the Future plan.","Turning now to the economy, Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate at 7.3% as of September remains well below the national average. However, energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers excluding the iron ore mines drop by 1.8% in the third quarter of this year. This was slightly better though, than our expectations. Our plan for the year as you may remember projected a reduction in sales to our large commercial and industrial group in part because two customers began using their own soft generation. Excluding these two customers and the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial sales actually rose by six-tenths of 1%. Sectors showing particular strength in the quarter included food products, chemical manufacturing and metal fabrication.","We\u2019re also seeing an uptick now in new customer connections. New electric service installations are up 9.8% compared to the first nine months of last year. And connections of new natural gas customers, given today\u2019s price of natural gas, are up by more than 14% compared with the same period a year-ago.","On the construction front, we have one major project underway. The 50 megawatt biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin and one significant project that was recently completed, the air quality control upgrade at our original Oak Creek units. In fact on September 4, we closed out this $900 million air quality project, the second largest construction project in our history on time and better than budget.","The wet scrubbers and the selective catalytic reduction equipment are operational now and delivering the emission reductions that we had expected. We\u2019re completing punch list items and final tuning and testing, as well as demolition of the old chimneys at the site. Demolition of the chimneys and a few remaining project items are expected to be completed in the third quarter of next year.","We are also making excellent progress on our biomass fuel generating plant at the site of the Domtar Paper Mill in Rothschild. Construction is approximately 50% complete now. We are on schedule and on budget to meet a completion date by the end of 2013. The main boiler erection will continue into the first quarter of next year at the site, a steam turbine and generator have been delivered and placed on their foundations, piping and electrical work have begun in several areas of the complex including the main boiler, turbine, water treatment, cooling water, pump house and auxiliary boilers. The transformers, switches, and bus-bar have also been set in the switch yard and construction of the piping for the mills steam supply is now underway.","As I\u2019ve noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable energy. We will be able to dispatch the unit and the efficient technology that will produce electricity for the grid and steam for the operating paper mill will clearly enhance the economics of the project. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Of course the biomass project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park that we completed last year are key components that will help us meet Wisconsin\u2019s renewable portfolio standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, that standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity delivered from renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 10% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using an historical baseline. Applying that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015.","When we complete the biomass project we will be well positioned to meet that 2015 standard. Also we recently signed agreements for renewable energy credits, which should allow us to be in compliance through the year 2019 and because of favorable market conditions we plan to purchase more renewable credits further extending the timeframe that we expect to be in compliance.","Turning now to other items of interest. In past quarters, we discussed with you the impact we were seeing from conditions in the coal and natural gas markets. Natural gas prices have continued to be at relatively low levels influencing the dispatch order and locational marginal pricing in the Midwest power market. Over the years, of course, the key to serving customers at a competitive price has been fuel diversity and fuel diversity was a core principle of our Power the Future plan.","You may remember that our plan called for the addition of 2200 megawatts of new capacity. Capacity that is almost equally balanced between natural gas and coal. And now with our efficient new capacity in place and natural gas prices at low levels, our natural gas burn is expected to nearly double from 28.5 billion cubic feet last year to 50 billion cubic feet this year. In fact our natural gas units at Port Washington operated at a 56% capacity factor in the first three quarters of this year. This compares with a 23% capacity factor during the same period of 2011. Our Port Washington units are essentially now being dispatched as base load units.","And of course as our natural gas burns have gone up, our coal burns have naturally come down. We are projecting to burn approximately 8.1 million tons of coal this year versus 10.7 million tons in 2011. We will achieve this reduction by maximizing the use of coal storage facilities and by working with our coal suppliers to amend existing contracts.","Another important development; we are waiting approval of our filing for a revised air permit that would allow us to blend Western and Eastern coals at our new Oak Creek expansion units. The new units are currently permitted to burn Eastern bituminous coal. However, moving to a blend with Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal could substantially lower fuel cost for our customers.","We expect to receive approval of our request for a revised air permit by year-end. Our plan then calls for us to begin testing the blended coal at our Oak Creek expansion units during the year 2013. Overall, our diverse fleet and our long-term power purchase agreement for nuclear energy position us well as the power markets continue to evolve.","Now I will briefly review where we stand on the regulatory front in Wisconsin, where we\u2019re in the final stages of our only active rate case. As you may recall, base rates for our electric customers in Wisconsin are frozen for 2012. We proposed and the Wisconsin Commission accepted a creative approach to delay a base rate increase as the economy here continues to recover. Looking forward to 2013 and 2014, we filed a rate request with the Wisconsin Commission seeking an increase for our electric and steam customers and a decrease for our natural gas customers for 2013.","On the electric side of our business, the base rate adjustments were seeking in the next two years are driven by approximately $1.6 billion of capital investment. These are investments in strengthening reliability, in meeting environmental requirements and complying with Wisconsin\u2019s renewable energy mandate and their investments that the Commission previously approved. The projects previously approved by the Commission include the air quality control system for the older Oak Creek units, the Glacier Hills Wind Park, the biomass facility and the expansion units at Oak Creek.","Our proposal includes using a federal energy grant that we expect to receive for our biomass facility. After applying this cash grant the result would be a net customer bill increase of 3.6% in 2013 and 2014. Fuel cost estimates for 2013 will continue to be refined based on updated information of course. A final fuel cost recovery rate will also be part of the Commission\u2019s order that we expect to receive in December.","On the natural gas front, we proposed as I mentioned a decrease in base rates for 2013. We're seeking a 2.3% decrease for Wisconsin Gas customers and a two-tenths of 1% decrease for Wisconsin Electric gas customers. Then for 2014 we\u2019re proposing the base rates for all of our natural gas customers remain flat.","For our steam utility, we filed for an increase in 2013 of approximately 6% for our downtown Milwaukee steam customers and 7% for our Milwaukee County steam customers. In 2014, our proposal calls for a 6% increase for downtown customers and for Milwaukee County customers as well. You may remember that the Wisconsin commission does not intend to pursue capital structure or return on equity as issues in this proceeding. We expect to receive the orders by the end of 2012. We\u2019ve asked that new electric and steam rates go into effect at the start of 2013 and 2014 and that new gas rates be effective at the start of 2013 as well.","Switching gears now, you will recall that our Board has approved a share repurchase plan scheduled to run through the end of 2013 that authorizes us to buy back $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. During the third quarter of this year we repurchased approximately 400,000 shares at a cost of $14 million. As of September 30, this brings the total number of shares repurchased under the plan to approximately 3.6 million at a cost of $114 million. That equates to an average purchase price of just $31.45 a share.","And as we previously announced, our Board has adopted a dividend policy that targets a 60% payout ratio in 2014. This policy should support double-digit growth in the dividend in both 2013 and 2014 as we move toward a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector.","Finally, I'd like to briefly touch on the investment opportunities that we see in our core business. As we\u2019ve mentioned our capital budget calls for spending up to $3.5 billion over the five-year period 2012 through 2016. And with this five-year budget the nature of our capital investments is shifting away from high-profile projects such as our Power the Future units, renewable generation and large air quality controls. Instead our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. The building blocks, if you will of our delivery business, pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations.","The primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory, construction are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the major mega projects we\u2019ve just completed. Our focus on renewing our distribution facilities is essential to maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest.","Also, as you may recall, the future of the Presque Isle Power Plant in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan is under review because of expected changes in National Ambient Air Quality Standards. So, we\u2019ve been working to identify a life extension option for the Presque Isle plant that is economically beneficial for our customers.","We are close now to signing a joint venture agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative for environmental upgrades at the Presque Isle units and potential joint ownership of the plant. Under this proposed agreement, Wolverine would pay for the environmental upgrades and receive an ownership interest in the facility. Preliminary work has continued on this project, we\u2019ve completed the second phase of engineering and a detailed scope of work has been developed. If the joint venture moves forward, we would not expect our rate base to be reduced. The transaction would of course be subject to customary regulatory approvals.","In August, we also announced our plans to convert the fuel source for the Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The Valley plant is a cogeneration facility, located along the Menomonee River in Milwaukee that generates electricity for the grid and produces steam to heat hundreds of downtown Milwaukee buildings. Our analysis shows that converting the fuel source for the plant will actually reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the Valley units.","We plan to file an application with the Wisconsin Commission in the second quarter of 2013 for approval to modify the plant to use only natural gas in the future. The electric capacity of the plant is expected to remain at 280 megawatts. If approved, we will target completion of the conversion for late 2015 or early 2016. The current cost estimate is between $60 million and $65 million. And as you may remember, in addition we will upgrade the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. The Wisconsin Commission approved this $26 million investment back in June. We already believe that the plan we put in place will secure Valley\u2019s role in meeting the energy needs of a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many, many years to come.","Finally there is one more development that I\u2019d like to cover with you today. Our latest analysis shows that additional capacity is needed for our natural gas distribution network in the Western part of Wisconsin. We are beginning to evaluate routes to serve the communities between Eau Claire County in the far Western part of the state and the City of Tomah in Monroe County in West Central Wisconsin.","This region will need additional capacity for three reasons; to address reliability, to meet growth and demand from customers who are converting from propane, and also from the extensive growth we are seeing in sand mining in that part of the state. The fine sand that\u2019s used in hydraulic fracking is found in abundance in Western Wisconsin and mining and processing operations are thriving now in this region.","We plan to seek approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin in 2013 to proceed with the necessary system enhancements. Our expected investment in this initial phase of this gas distribution project is approximately $150 million.","And now with more details on our third quarter and our outlook for the remainder of 2012 is our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?","J. Patrick Keyes","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned earlier our 2012 third quarter earnings from continuing operations were $0.67 a share, as compared to $0.55 a share in 2011. The results were better than last year because of lower operation and maintenance costs, favorable fuel recoveries and the positive impact of the Company share repurchase program.","Taking a closer look at the numbers, I will focus on the earnings drivers at the operating income level by business segment and then touch on the other income statement items. I will also discuss cash flows for the first nine months of the year.","Our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2012 was $281 million as compared to $224 million in last year\u2019s third quarter, an increase of $57 million. Starting with the utility energy segment you will see that the operating income totaled $191 million, an increase of $55 million versus 2011.","As Gale mentioned earlier, we experienced record heat in the third quarter of 2012. Well, we also experienced a hot third quarter in 2011. So the weather was positive compared to normal, but was not the major factor in our relatively strong third quarter performance. I will elaborate further on the impact of weather in my sales remarks.","When looking at our utility operating income in the third quarter of 2012 as compared to the third quarter of 2011, we see positive variances because of lower O&M, and more favorable fuel recoveries. Our non-fuel O&M was $53 million lower this quarter primarily because of the one-year rate amortization holiday that began in January. Our fuel recoveries improved by $19 million because of lower natural gas prices.","Partially offsetting these items was increased utility depreciation expense of $11 million driven by the new Glacier Hills Wind Park which went into service in December of last year and the new air quality control project at our older Oak Creek units, the last train of which went into service in early September. Combined these two projects represent almost $1.3 billion of new investment.","The rate agreement in place for 2012 contemplated these investments. As you will recall, we agreed to freeze base electric rates and in return the Wisconsin Commission approved a one-year holiday on the amortization of certain regulatory assets. The reduction in O&M expenses as a result of the amortization holiday allows us to offset higher depreciation cost in new assets and earn a return on the $1.3 billion of new investment.","Operating income in the Non-Utility Energy Segment, which consists primarily of our Power the Future units, was up by $2 million. As we mentioned during previous calls, we finalized the depreciable lives of the new Oak Creek units in 2012, which had a slight positive impact on earnings. Taking the changes for these two segments together, you arrive at the $57 million increase in operating income for the third quarter of 2012.","Corporate charges and other miscellaneous items were flat year-over-year. During the third quarter of 2012, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company increased just slightly over 2011. Our other income was reduced by $7 million because of lower AFUDC. In the third quarter last year, we were earning AFUDC on the Glacier Hills Wind Park and the Air Quality Control project at our Oak Creek site. We have stopped accruing AFUDC, now that these assets have been placed in service.","Net interest expense increased by $4 million, primarily because of lower capitalized interest associated with less construction work. Consolidated income tax expense rose by approximately $21 million because of higher pre-tax earnings and higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be between 35.5% and 36.5%. Combining all of these items, brings you to $156 million of net income from continuing operations for the third quarter of 2012 or earnings of $0.67 per share.","During the first nine months of 2012, our adjusted operating cash flow totaled $1 billion, which is a $238 million increase over the same period in 2011. Our adjusted operating cash flow includes the impact of changes in restricted cash. The largest favorable factor relates to our benefits plants. In September of this year, we contributed $100 million to our plants compared to $257 million last year.","Our total capital expenditures decreased by $135 million in the first nine months of 2012 as compared to the corresponding period in 2011. We saw lower capital expenditures as large capital projects were completed. We also paid $207 million in common dividends in the first nine months of 2012, which was $25 million greater than the same period last year. Dividends in the first nine months equate to an annual rate of $1.20 per share, which is a 15% increase over the prior-year\u2019s annual dividend of $1.04 per share.","As of September 30, 2012, our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 52.1%. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","As shown in the earnings packet on our website, retail sales of electricity decreased by seven-tenths of 1% during the first nine months of 2012 as compared to the same period in 2011. Our weather normalized sales were down by 1.7%. In our plan for the year we took into account an extended outage at our largest customer, and we knew that two other customers were move to self generation. Adjusting for these three customers normalized retail sales were flat during the first nine months of 2012 as compared to 2011.","Looking now at individual customer segments. We see actual residential sales slightly down in the quarter compared to 2011. Although the quarter overall was warmer than 2011, the weather pattern was different in 2012. This year\u2019s third quarter started out with a week of intense heat followed by a cooler period. And then the end of the quarter was slightly warmer than 2011. Conversely, high humidity and warmer than normal temperatures persisted throughout the third quarter in 2011.","On a year-to-date basis, residential sales are up six-tenths of 1% and on a normalized basis residential sales are down seven-tenths of 1%. Across our small commercial and industrial group we saw actual quarterly sales up seven-tenths of 1% and year-to-date sales up 1.1%.On a weather normalized basis, year-to-date sales to small commercial and industrial customers are up six-tenths of 1%. We continue to see modest growth in our small C&I class.","In the large commercial industrial segment, quarterly sales were down by 8.3%. However if you exclude the iron ore mines and the two self generation customers, sales were up six-tenths of 1%. Year-to-date sales are down 3.3% and excluding those same customers sales are up by 1.7%. On a normalized basis, year-to-date sales excluding these customers are flat.","Turning now to our earnings guidance. We are increasing our guidance for the year. We now expect our earnings for 2012 to be in the range of $2.31 a share to $2.33 a share. Assuming normal weather our guidance for the fourth quarter is in a range of $0.39 to $0.41 a share.","We will be carrying out a number of maintenance projects in the fourth quarter. In addition, the AFUDC will be lower and depreciation expense will be higher both compared to last year\u2019s fourth quarter because of the $1.3 billion of assets we placed in service. However, we still expect to earn our full allowed return on equity at Wisconsin Electric.","And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa","Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we\u2019re on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","(Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Gale E. Klappa","Hi, Greg. ","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Thanks, guys.","Gale E. Klappa","Greg, your bunker would (indiscernible) these days?","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","I\u2019d rather sleep in a puddle, but there is no power south of 48th street, but I was able to find a bunk at some place with power until they can get that transformer back on 13th street. They \u2013 apparently they had a 14 foot storm surge when the highest storm surge they had seen was 12.5 feet in 1888, so bad luck for ConEd, but hopefully they will get power back on soon. Anyways \u2026","Gale E. Klappa","(Indiscernible) hanging in there, Greg.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","My first question is on the coal blending, I visited the site of the construction site several times while you were building the new units, and I know that you\u2019ve a sort of a state-of-the-art coal blending facility there. What was the initial expected use of the coal blending facility, if not to blend coals they way you\u2019re now asking to blend them or was it initially meant mainly to blend sort of (indiscernible) and other Eastern coals, and now you are asking to blend Eastern and Western. Can you explain that?","Gale E. Klappa","We will let Allen Leverett to answer that for you, Greg.","Allen L. Leverett","Yeah and I\u2019m not sure, Greg, what time period you were at the site. We don\u2019t actually have a blending facility. What you might be remembering is inside that very large cold storage building there is \u2013 what\u2019s called a stacker reclaimer, but we don\u2019t actually have the capability right now to be able to blend at the site \u2026","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Okay. That was what I was thinking of. So, [thank you].","Allen L. Leverett","\u2026 either on the belt or inside the boiler itself. So what we are looking to do is really explore next year, two approaches to doing fuel blending. So one, the so-called on the belt where you actually have a blending facility like you are probably thinking of at other sites and then another approach where you would actually blend what they call in the furnace. So we are going to look at those two approaches and then figure out what\u2019s really the best long-term approach to really getting some fuel flexibility at the site.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","How much Powder River Basin coal would you be buying if you were given approval to do what you\u2019re asking for?","Allen L. Leverett","Well, I guess, I would think of it in terms of potential blend percentages. And our long-term goal Greg is to be able to burn either 100% bituminous or 100% PRB. So we want to be able to burn all blends in between, but I think realistically probably the highest we\u2019re going to get on PRB for a while would be 80% PRB. But we will have to do a lot of testing in order to figure out what\u2019s the best approach and what are the hurdles that we will have to overcome to get to that 80% level. So I think for the next few years, I think that's probably from a practical standpoint the cap on what we could burn in terms of PRB, but longer-term we would like the flexibility to go to 100%.","Gale E. Klappa","And Greg this is Gale. Just one other point that might be helpful, we did invest early on and you maybe remembering this as well, early on in the design of these new units we did invest about $24 million to make sure that with an additional investment that Allen\u2019s talking about, we could actually have the unit do operate on a blend of coals. So the initial design and the initial work there built in the capability we need, so that if we made an additional investment in blending it could actually pay off.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Great. Next question is on capital spending, when we look at the capital spending program in your last analyst update, should we be adding the programs you talked about in terms of the \u2013 I think it was to the gas pipeline expansions and the powering of the generation unit? Are those additional capital spending on top of what you\u2019ve already budgeted or those fall inside \u2013 that you\u2019ve already sort of budgeted for?","Gale E. Klappa","Good question, Greg and those in terms of that 2012 through 2016 $3.5 billion program these fall inside.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","They fall inside, great. Final question, you had talked about the possibility that the Government of Wisconsin might consider selling some of its power generation units that it just simply doesn\u2019t have the money to maintain or retrofit with environmental upgrades. Is there been any progress on that front and do you think that that will be an event that you will be able to consider making an investment in 2013?","Gale E. Klappa","Again, good question, Greg. If this occurs, meaning if legislation \u2013 this takes a piece of legislation to enable the current administration to sell those units. There are 37, some of them very small, but 37 generating units some of them provide steam only across the State of Wisconsin. I certainly \u2013 from everything we can tell the governor would still like to put the operation of those plants and the environmental upgrades that will cost several hundred million dollars into the private sector. And if that occurs, it would occur I think in 2013 with a piece of legislation. So that will be a 2013 event if it does occur. But certainly the logic of why that would be a good thing for the state is firmly in place.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","Thanks, guys.","Gale E. Klappa","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim Von Riesemann with UBS.","Gale E. Klappa","Hi, Jim.","Jim Von Riesemann - UBS Securities","Hi, Gale. How are you?","Gale E. Klappa","We are good. Are you hanging out, okay?","Jim Von Riesemann - UBS Securities","We are doing fine. Thanks for asking though. Hang out, I\u2019m in car driving where I\u2019ve actual power to talk to you. So I\u2019m safe. The question is really a broad picture. With Dominion\u2019s announced shutdown of the Kewaunee facility, can you talk broadly about energy policy in the state of Wisconsin, what it means from both generation needs and maybe transmission needs, especially in light of the fracking sands too?","Gale E. Klappa","Sure. We would be happy too. I think that there is one important conclusion that comes out of the \u2013 it comes out naturally out of the decision by Dominion to close the Kewaunee reactor and that is \u2013 there is no doubt in my mind, it makes more valuable to our customers, the Port Washington natural gas units and the Oak Creek coal units that we've completed as part of Power the Future. And if you think about it, it\u2019s taking over 500 megawatts of base load capacity out of the picture in the State of Wisconsin. So, regardless of growth or regardless of anything else that happens because we have these brand new very efficient units in place, it is bound to make those units more valuable for our customers. I think that's piece one.","Piece two, you asked about transmission. And I do know that American Transmission Company is taking another hard look at one particular transmission line that it had proposed. It actually had proposed the transmission line to help move energy out of the Point Beach plant that's been operated. If you remember NextEra I think added about 17% to the capacity of the Point Beach units.","And American Transmission Company had proposed to help alleviate some transmission constraints in that area by building a new transmission line. They\u2019ve now withdrawn that proposal. They still think something will be needed. But remember Kewaunee and the Point Beach units are very near to each other. So taking Kewaunee out of service probably alleviates some of the transmission constraints. So there maybe some less, modestly less investment in one particular transmission line by ATC as a result of this. However, we really don\u2019t see any major impact on our ATC earnings growth in the near-term as a result of this. I mean we think the prospects for ATC earnings growth certainly over the next three to five years remain as we have them in our plan. Does that help, Jim?","Jim Von Riesemann - UBS Securities","That does. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa","You\u2019re more than welcome. Hang in there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC Financial.","Gale E. Klappa","Hi, Kit.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","Good afternoon, guys.","Gale E. Klappa","Are you in Jersey or where are you Kit?","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","I\u2019m in Midtown. So the lights are on, but the steam is not. So no hot water. Oh well, there are worse problems.","Gale E. Klappa","If you come to Downtown Milwaukee, we'll get you a shower.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","Yeah, that sounded very attractive, we have this big crane hanging over here. You may have \u2026","Gale E. Klappa","Oh my goodness, yeah.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","\u2026 seen the pictures, right?","Gale E. Klappa","Yes.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","That\u2019s an engineering project, you should send some guys to work on.","Gale E. Klappa","But we got a bunch of crews out there helping up, but not on the crane.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","There you go. Follow-up on your discussion on the buyback, so this is the first in a while I believe can you discuss with us what let\u2019s say trip wire there was that led to the decision to go ahead and buyback and what we should look for then on the remaining amount of authorization over the next five quarters, now?","Gale E. Klappa","Sure, be happy to and really the trip wire was very simple and it consisted of two factors that Pat and I took into account. And the first was that we continue to do very well on cash generation this year. And as you know we don\u2019t think building up and just holding cash on our balance sheet makes a whole lot of sense. So we were continuing to do well against our plan on cash generation for a number of reasons. And then secondly, as you know the market choked a little bit over the last few months particularly after utilities hit a high in early August and we thought as the stock price retreated some we thought it was a good opportunity to spend a very modest amount of money it was only $14 million.","And so those were the factors that led to our decision to go ahead and repurchase $14 million. As I mentioned we are now at about $114 million total of our share repurchases since the start of 2011. And we\u2019ve been able to do that at $31.45 a share for the average repurchase price, which we think is very, very good price. I don\u2019t think you can read anything into what that might mean for the next few quarters. We can be very patient here, but again I think fundamentally a build-up of cash on the balance sheet it\u2019s better even where the stock is trading to buyback stock than to build up a lot of cash on the balance sheet. But we also are balancing all of that against investment opportunities as we see them. So our preference obviously would be to invest the capital and our cash flow in additional utility like projects that do not change our risk profile. One of which of course, would be the one we just talked about if it came to pass, which would be the state-owned power plants.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","Very good. And speaking of the investment opportunities then, can you give us a few more details on the gas pipeline expansion opportunity, even looking a little longer term out in Western Wisconsin?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, we mentioned in the prepared remarks that the first phase of this project we thought, if approved would be approximately $150 million. There is as we look at potential demand and as we look at reliability issues in the western part of the state, there could be beyond this first phase a second phase that might be $50 million, $60 million of additional capital as well, but that would be a little further out into the five year period.","Let me just say this about the western gas expansion project that we\u2019re going to prepare an application for to the commission. The western part of Wisconsin is quite rural, and our distribution network out there in the western part of the state has not been incredibly robust. But we\u2019re seeing other things going on in addition to the explosion of frac sand mining there. It means the frac sand is not the only reason why we think this is an investment we need to make for reliability. We have two hubs out in the western part of the state where our reserve margins even with very modest growth will go below acceptable levels over the next couple of years.","So, just looking at system reliability on our gas distribution network we believe we need to make this investment and then we\u2019re also seeing and you can see it in the numbers I mentioned earlier. We\u2019re also seeing a pretty significant uptick in customers moving to natural gas particularly from propane in rural areas. I think I mentioned to you, our new customer connections over our entire system for the first nine months of this year on the natural gas side are up 14% compared to a year ago. So we\u2019re seeing customer growth, we\u2019re seeing just general demand requiring us to make some enhancements and then we\u2019re seeing a very, very strong expansion of frac sand mining in the western part of the state. I believe for example just talking with our folks yesterday that we\u2019re in conversations with 12 or more frac sand mining operations in the western part of the state who asked us to take a hard look at providing them service.","Kit Konolige - BGC Financial","All right, good. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa","Terrific. Thanks, Kit. I appreciate it. Hang in there.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Gale E. Klappa","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hey guys. Congrats on a good quarter. Kind of an O&M related question. Just want to make sure I\u2019m following the numbers correctly here. Year-to-date, how much was the drop off tied to the regulatory amortization and then what explains the rest of the year-over-year decline in O&M?","Gale E. Klappa","Okay, well essentially on the rate order that we have in place freezing base rates, it has as part of that order $37 million per quarter in essence of cessation of amortization of regulatory assets. So if you look at this quarter for example, of the O&M reduction $37 million was tied to the rate order and the cessation of amortization of regulatory assets, the remainder is what I would say \u2013 and I am really proud of our managers across the business, the remainder is dozens of very solid O&M cost control initiatives that have really been bearing fruit.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","And how do we think about what the year-to-date define in O&M is outside of the amortization and how do we compare that to the O&M requested in your general rate cases?","Gale E. Klappa","Okay, well we have got some numbers here, we\u2019re turning to the right page. First of all if you take the amount associated with the holiday, the amortization holiday and the rate freeze, Steve its $37 million times three, right?","Stephen P. Dickson","That\u2019s right. So $101 million for the year and at the utility the O&M reduction is about $107 million. So you\u2019ve got $4 million of increase cost and that\u2019s across the Boards benefit cost, medical costs or higher. So basically at the utility the story is the freeze on the amortization.","Gale E. Klappa","All right. Now to your question Michael about, how does that compare with our O&M request in the rate case?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Yeah.","Gale E. Klappa","Really kind of apples-to-oranges, because a big part \u2013 well the biggest part of our rate case is, the recovery off and on at $1.3 billion of capital investment on projects the commission has already approved. So we do our adding to our rate request because we need people to operate for example, the quality controls at the overall creek units that are now in service. So in essence what I think you could \u2013 the conclusion you could properly draw is that for basic ongoing O&M we tried to stay pretty flat from 13 to 12, but there is a component of O&M that we need to add because we\u2019re adding people to operate the new assets coming into service.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Understood. One final question; there\u2019s been some news flow about an ATC proposed line and I believe one of your neighbors, there had been some conflicts that had gone in to the FERC regarding which utility, whether it was ATC or whether it was I think one of the Xcel subsidiaries would actually be the builder of the line and I saw in the last 24 or 48 hours some news about potentially what's drawing application. Can you just provide some color on this please?","Gale E. Klappa","I will ask Allen Leverett to answer that, but to frame it for you, I don\u2019t think the dispute is about who\u2019s going to build the line, it\u2019s who will eventually own what chunk of the line.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Got it.","Gale E. Klappa","Who will be sharing of the capacity in ownership but mostly it\u2019s an issue about ownership. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett","Yeah, well I think maybe Michael, you were alluding to two separate facilities. The first one is the one where ATC is having dispute with Xcel and that\u2019s the Badger Coulee line and that\u2019s about $350 million facility. It could very well be that ATC and Xcel end up sharing 50-50 the ownership of that facility. But all that\u2019s on appeal at the FERC at this point.","I would say longer term Michael, as you have order 1000 kick in, the FERC order around planning I think in the future we shouldn\u2019t have uncertainty about ownership in these types of situations, but the Badger Coulee facility is certainly an open issue. The other facility that you may have been thinking about is the one that\u2019s connected with the Kewaunee closure.","Originally ATC had proposed to build a facility called Barnhart-Branch River, and they\u2019re putting that on hold given that Kewaunee is going to be closing. So that\u2019s the second facility I think that you\u2019re referring to. But from a high level, I\u2019d just reiterate what Gale was saying earlier.","We wouldn\u2019t see, regardless of what happens with the ownership of Badger Coulee, regardless of what happens with Barnhart-Branch River, we don\u2019t see an impact in ATC earnings over the next three years meaning \u201813 to \u201915. Does that help, Michael?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Very helpful, Allen. Very helpful, Gale. Thanks guys. I much appreciate it.","Gale E. Klappa","You\u2019re more than welcome. Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Gale E. Klappa","Good afternoon, Paul. How you doing?","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","Well. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa","Good. Now you\u2019re not anywhere near New York?","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","There\u2019s one benefit to living in Cleveland, I guess?","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah.","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","Besides nothing (indiscernible).","Gale E. Klappa","What is that \u2013 is that you\u2019re not part of that show on TV called Broken Cleveland; are you?","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","I\u2019m [damn] near.","Allen L. Leverett","Almost broken.","Gale E. Klappa","What can we do for you, Paul?","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","What was the absolute fuel recovery through the quarter?","Gale E. Klappa","I think it was $19 million.","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","For last year it was break even?","Gale E. Klappa","That\u2019s correct.","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","And what's the risk of additional \u2026","Allen L. Leverett","Paul, we \u2013 sorry Paul we misunderstood that. The benefit to the quarter on a year-to-year basis was $19 million. In the third quarter we had higher costs because the plants are running and so last year we under recovered by $34 million and this year it\u2019s about $15 million. So the change was about $19 million.","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","Got it.","Gale E. Klappa","We were under recovered for the quarter, but the positive swing was $19 million.","Allen L. Leverett","Right.","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","Not as under recovered, okay. And what's the potential for more self-generation?","Gale E. Klappa","The two particular customers that we mentioned that have moved to self-generation where in my opinion fairly unique circumstances. One is a paper mill and they are moving more to use of biomass to fuel their paper operations, and the other is a sewage district where they\u2019ve got the ability to use some methane gas on and off. Those circumstances again I think are pretty unique to those two particular customers. I would not view this as a trend.","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","Where did you outperform relative to third quarter guidance?","Gale E. Klappa","Well relative to third quarter guidance I think there are couple of places where we did better than we thought when we gave our third quarter guidance. And the first is, when we were on the call at the end of the second quarter we knew we'd have some warm weather, but overall we came in better than we thought just on revenues, because of the intense heat in early July and then it got warmer again towards the end of the quarter. So particularly the warmth we saw at the end of the quarter. We had a sense because when we were on the call we knew about the early July, but the warmth at the end of the quarter was quite helpful in terms of additional sales and then I believe we actually did a little bit on fuel recovery than we thought we were going to do.","Paul Ridzon - Keybanc Capital Markets Inc.","Okay. And Gale, is it true for Halloween you\u2019re going to be a CEO of a large Charlotte based utility?","Gale E. Klappa","I don\u2019t know. They didn\u2019t deliver the Jim Rogers masks.

Leslie, how are you today?","Operator","Leslie, your line is open.","Gale E. Klappa","Leslie went trick-or-treating I think.","Operator","And we\u2019ve moved on to the next question from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Hey Pat, I just want to make sure I understood some of your comments about the fourth quarter. Can you talk a little bit about some of the puts and takes from fourth quarter '11 to fourth quarter '12, just trying to think about the bridge year-over-year?","J. Patrick Keyes","Sure, Michael. I'll just kind of re-summarize some of my remarks. I think the biggest difference is we talked about $0.39 to $0.41 as our guidance in the fourth quarter this year. One thing is -- as Gale mentioned, we had a very hot summer. We've got a lot of stress on the network, so we've got a number of maintenance projects that we've added to our fourth quarter plans, which is additional spend than we had originally.","And we also talked about the rate settlement, and that $37 million flat a quarter was kind of a simplified way to do it. If you think about how the depreciation expense for an example falls, it picks-up in the fourth quarter because everything is on line. So, we've got additional depreciation vis-\u00e0-vis that amortization order. That's probably the two biggest.","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah, I think Pat\u2019s kind of nailed it. But as we said during the prepared remarks, we fully expect to earn our allowed authorized return on equity at Wisconsin Electric.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Okay. I just want to make sure on the depreciation side. If the regulatory amort is rolling off and that the primary impact of that is actually felt in O&M. What's driving \u2013 were you brining South Oak Creek [enviro] controls into service and therefore you experienced that depreciation for the first time beginning in fourth quarter 2012, or is there some other driver?","J. Patrick Keyes","That's direct on a 78 train, yes.","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah. We completed the last segment of the air quality control upgrade at the older Oak Creek units on September 4. So when that happens obviously we stop accruing allowance for funds used during construction. We start depreciating the new asset. So, all of those two things the cessation of AFUDC, and the depreciation of the asset are basically \u2013 almost $900 million project, that's a pretty big swing for Q4.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc.","Got it, okay. Thanks guys. I much appreciate it.","Gale E. Klappa","You\u2019re welcome Michael.","Operator","And we do have a question from the line of Leslie Rich with J.P. Morgan.","Gale E. Klappa","Hi, Leslie.","Operator","Leslie, your line is open.","Gale E. Klappa","I\u2019ll tell you what we can do. We will be happy to call Leslie later after the call, since she obviously is having some difficultly with either her phone or with the power in New York.","Operator","Yes sir. And your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Gale E. Klappa","Greetings Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Good evening. Can you hear me?","Gale E. Klappa","We sure can.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Just two quick ones here; the 9.8% increase I think you said for electrical connects for the last nine months. Did I hear that correct and how does that related to customer growth?","Gale E. Klappa","You are correct, I think we said 9.8% uptick in for the nine month period this year compared with the first nine months of last year in Electric, new customer connections, but on the natural gas side it's actually above 14% growth. We are coming off though a very low period of growth in terms of new customers. So these are nice upticks, but we're still only seeing about a three to four tenths of 1% growth in the total customer base of both the electric -- actually probably four tenth of 1% growth on the natural gas side so far this year, little less than that on the electric slide, but encouraging -- encouraging.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","So when you say -- there are a lot of people who are -- lot of customers are disconnecting, is that what it is, so the net number isn't that much? Is that how we should think about it?","Gale E. Klappa","No, I think what you're seeing is just very flattish growth. We haven't seen a lot of disconnects.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay, so the 9.8%, why isn't that \u2013 I'm sorry to be so slow, why is that only leading to four tenths of 1% customer growth if you\u2019re getting 9.8% new customers and you\u2019re not losing that many?","Gale E. Klappa","Because if you look at and let's assume for a minute, all right, let's a take a one million for ease of discussion. We have about one million natural gas customers. So if you have four tenth of 1% growth in one year or three tenth of 1% growth in one year, and then four or five tenths of 1% growth in the next comparable period, you\u2019re not going to drive the raw numbers that much higher. It's the percentage growth compared to \u2026","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay I figured out. So in other words, it's the question of how much new customer -- I think I'm just -- I misunderstood for what base that was, okay. The iron ore mine, what was the actual impact of the iron ore mine? It sounds like you guys had really hot weather, but you had no new peak. If you had the iron ore mine operating, would you have had a new peak? Can you just tell us what the iron ore mine itself would have done?","Gale E. Klappa","And Will, I\u2019m looking at Scott and Steve on specifically on the iron ore mine, because they were at half load during those really hot days, and they\u2019re about -- probably it would have added another 100 megawatts.","Stephen P. Dickson","Yeah, 50 to 100.","Gale E. Klappa","50 to 100 additional megawatts. But there\u2019s one other point that's important here, and that is, this was July 5 and July 6. And as you know, during the first week of July a lot of manufacturing customers are shutdown for summer all of that week because it's a holiday week. So, not only did we have the mines because of their planned outage at half load if you will, but we had a lot of manufacturing customers that weren\u2019t operating. So, there is no doubt in my mind that had it been a normal week, assume for a minute those hot temperatures that occurred on July 5 and July 6, had occurred on July 15. No doubt in my mind we would have set a new peak.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Now, you guys did benefit from weather though, I mean you guys mentioned how it was dispersed differently, but if I am looking at your financials, you guys do actually seem to suggest if I'm reading them correctly that, the quarter did improve over last quarter by $2 million. Is that -- am I understanding that correctly or is that taking all the stuff into account or do you follow what I'm saying?","Gale E. Klappa","Steve, I think the $2 million is pretty accurate.","Stephen P. Dickson","Yeah, basically last year weather was favorable by about $21 million, this year it's favorable by about $23 million compared to normal, so that\u2019s how you got the $2 impact as compared to last year. But compared to normal it's about $23 million better compared to normal this year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. And then when we look at slide 11, and you mentioned a couple of things; I just want to make sure I understand this. Excluding the iron mine I guess or just excluding old mining, your retail sales growth is down the last nine months six tenths of 1% and that includes leap year, is that right, the benefit that you got from leap year?","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah. It does include that, but it also includes the two customers that we talked about that moved to self-generation.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Right, but they\u2019re not going to probably move back from self-generation, right?","Gale E. Klappa","No. That is correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","And I guess what I'm also wondering is, we are hearing a lot of interest out there in terms of the promotion of combined heat and power. And I know you mentioned that you don't see this as a trend the self-generation effort, and I just wanted to sort of highlight that, you don't see any trends or people being interested in combined heat and power, is that based because wholesale electric prices are low or how should we think of that?","Gale E. Klappa","Really I don't see us having a lot of -- we haven't had a lot of inquiries where there are not many, many discussions going on with customers about combined heat and power investments. Our industrial rates I believe are low enough, and then of course we have for new and expanding customers a real time pricing rate that is very attractive. I think when we you look at our combination of the tools we have to be able to offer and to expanding customers and new customers and be very competitive. I think we stack up very, very well. And if I can give you and then I hope this won't confuse you.","Let me give you two other energy sales statistics that were helpful to me, because when we start talking about weather adjusted and all these ins and outs, sometimes I think we can get lost in that and actually when you have weather as extreme as we've experienced both in the summer of 2011 and the summer 2012, you kind of get at the -- you kind of get two standard deviations away from norm and our weather normalization techniques that are available to the industry aren't that good frankly at the tail-end of these standard deviations.","So what I asked our folks to do is go back and tell me for the spring-summer period. So the six-month period ended September 30; April, May, June, July, August, and September; just give me actual results for residential sales for this period, this year and that second and third quarter period last year. And this helped me sort through the trend. Our residential sales that was warm both years -- in both quarters of both years. Our residential for the six months ended September 30 are up 2.9% actual. Our small commercial and industrial is up 2.7%, and that makes a lot more sense to me, it is warm both periods, different patterns in terms of the intensity of the weather, but I think that may shed some light on the fact that I don't see us in a huge declining trend here.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay, I guess the reason why I'm asking about Gale, quite frankly is you\u2019re not the only guys who are seeing very weak growth or negative growth. And we are seeing it all around the country. So, I just was wondering, is there anything else that you\u2019re seeing perhaps because I mean we'll say it\u2019s remarkable. Over the last 18 months, it seems to be pretty wide spread, but also I mean, just looking at some -- some utilities have had negative weather adjusted electric sales growth for almost three years. Is there anything, customer usage or anything that you\u2019re seeing -- I'm saying outside of -- do you follow what I'm asking?","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah. I follow and I appreciate that. I do think; well first of all many of the utilities that you\u2019re properly saying or seeing negative trends here in sales growth, many of those were in the faster growth regions of the country, where the boom and bust has been much more dramatic than it has been in the Midwest. We simply are just more stable and have been through this recession than many, many other regions. There's not a flash of growth here, but it is steady and it is stable and we\u2019re beginning to see some commercial activity that we've not seen in five or six years. Announcement of new shopping centers, announcement of a potential brand new skyscraper in downtown Milwaukee. The one trend I am seeing I think is, that we are beginning to see some commercial growth on the horizon that we've not seen over the last five or six years.","On the residential side, the other thing we are seeing is a continuation of what I've mentioned in past calls. Where we have -- what we call in the industry a shoulder month. Take a May or an October where it's easy for a customer not to turn-on the heat or to turn-off the air conditioning. We're seeing more conservation in the shoulder months where it is easier to concern. I don't think there\u2019s any question about that. So, those would be the two trends that I would point out to you; shoulder month conservation to a stronger degree than we have seen in the past and I think here for this region, some commercial growth that's on the horizon that may give our commercial and industrial sales a bit of a lift.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates","Okay. Thanks a lot. Happy Halloween.","Gale E. Klappa","Happy Halloween. Good questions.","Operator","You next question comes from the line of Jay Dobson with Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Gale E. Klappa","Greetings Jay. How are you sir?","James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Very well, thanks Gale. How about you?","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah fine. Your power on.","James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","My power is on. Thank you. Very different than 2003 when you and I chatted.","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah, exactly.","James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","And anyway I wanted to revisit the O&M item. I think I\u2019m still just getting a little confused sort of what happened in the third quarter, so am I\u2019m specifically speaking about the slug excluding the $37 million regulatory asset amortization holiday. So that was down about $16 million, $53 million net of $37 million.","Can you give me just a flavor of what that was because as I look at it, it almost looks like some O&M was shifted to the fourth quarter because the weather was fairly similar, in fact actually probably somewhat more conducive to regular maintenance this year than last year? So, I am sort of confused with, so stressed about this third quarter that's forcing a lot of maintenance in the fourth quarter that wouldn't have been similar to a year ago. So anyway, just trying to get my head around this.","Gale E. Klappa","Well we\u2019ll ask Steve to take a shot and then I\u2019ll also give you my view on it.","Stephen P. Dickson","Yeah you\u2019re right. It\u2019s about $53 million decline and $37 million relates to the amortization. There's a lot of small things in there, one of the things is the gas distribution expenses were down because there was a mild winter. So as we didn't need to perform as much work. There was a slight benefit in miscellaneous benefits expense because of a share performance on one of the benefit plans. So, that was a benefit to the Company reduction in expense and again that's tied to the stock price compared to other companies, but that was relatively minor. But there\u2019s a lot of small things, but maintenance and the delivery. And yeah, the other thing that helped us on the Electric side, even though it was very hot in the third quarter, we did not experience major storms. And so the storm expense was low compared to last year.","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah. And overall, as I mentioned in addition and Steve is very accurate on the things he cited. We just have a lot of cost consciousness and a lot of cost control going on across the organization. Its little things here and there; but they all add up.","James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Right, no -- no absolutely. But maybe think about it differently; with the major maintenance that you're doing in the fourth quarter that's dragging fourth quarter earnings relative to a year ago, not have occurred last year at all in the second half?","Gale E. Klappa","No, but we\u2019ll have more of it in Q4 of this year than in Q4 of last year.","James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","So more than in the second half -- ","Gale E. Klappa","I\u2019m sorry.","James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","So more than in the second half of last year?","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah.","James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","I understand in the fourth quarter definitely. I'm trying to get at the second half of \u2026","Gale E. Klappa","The answer is yes, more in the second half this year than in the second half last year.","James Dobson - Wunderlich Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks very much.","Gale E. Klappa","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin.","Gale E. Klappa","Dan I was hoping to hear from you today. Now before we get into this, I want to make sure that you\u2019re prepared for Halloween tonight. You have your bail money in small denominations, small bills because I am not going to bail you out again Dan.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","I have big bills, so \u2026","Gale E. Klappa","There you go. Well just forget my cell-phone number okay.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And the first question I have is kind of related to the rate proceeding you said you expect the decision by December. I'm just wondering if you could update us a little bit on kind of what discussions or what kind of testimony or feedback or whatever you've gotten from the Commission staff?","Gale E. Klappa","Sure, and I\u2019d be happy to Dan. In essence let me back up because I want to frame the case a little bit, and I think that\u2019ll help understand the briefs that have been filed in the case by all the parties. The predominant driver of our rate filing, remember it's 3.6% base rate increase that we're seeking. The overwhelmingly predominant driver is the capital we spent about $1.3 billion on the Glacier Hills Wind Park, on the air quality controls that we've just completed at the older Oak Creek units. Those are projects that were approved by the Commission. We've brought them in on time and on budget. And in the case of the air quality control upgrade actually better than budget.","So the rate case is in essence about seeking recovery in rates for those investments that were previously approved. So the lion share of the case is about capital, that's already been spent. A very small amount of the case is about our O&M projections on how much O&M we need to spend in 2013 and 2014, because if you recall in Wisconsin we have a two-year forward looking test year, so we project our expenses and our investment levels for 2013 and 2014 as part of the rate case. The staff is suggesting that we should spend less O&M than we have proposed for the 2013 and 2014 period. But it appears that they are comfortable with and we would expect they would have been comfortable with the capital investments and the fact that they were brought in previously approved on time and on budget.","So, the final rounds of briefs and discussions among the parties and with the commissioners as they\u2019re briefed is really about what's the -- it\u2019s really about now down to what is the O&M that's the appropriate O&M for us for 2013 and 2014. And as I mentioned to you for all of the Wisconsin utilities this year the Commission has decided that the current allowed return on equity and the current capital structure will stay in place. Does that help, Dan?","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So what's the ROE that\u2019s \u2026","Gale E. Klappa","For our Wisconsin Electric operation it's 10.4% and for our Wisconsin gas Corporation it's 10.5%.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. So the 3.6% is that like a onetime or is that, is there like one in 2013 and one in 2014 for the electric rate \u2026","Gale E. Klappa","More for the \u2013 it varies across the different operations, but for electric it's 3.6% and 3.6%. So 3.6% in 2013 and 3.6% in 2014, then we're actually and it\u2019d be helpful to remember this, we're actually filing for a decrease in our gas operations for Wisconsin Electric and in Wisconsin Gas operations as well.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Was that just a one-time decrease on the gas side then or how is that work?","Gale E. Klappa","No, we\u2019re actually asking for a decrease and then for that decrease to remain in place for 2014.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay, so that\u2019s rather two phase or is that just a onetime and then it would stay the same for gas?","Gale E. Klappa","That is exactly right Dan.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","And I had a question, you mentioned \u2026","Gale E. Klappa","Plus we need to heat that jail cell a little more for you.","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Right, yeah. I appreciate that. One thing you mentioned that you would be interested in if the State were to sell-off some of their generating facilities, but then you would need some sort of legislation related to that. Given the current and make-up of the legislature do you see that as something that's likely to happen or is that just something, I know that maybe the governor has that on his agenda, but have you -- what kind of feedback are you getting from the legislature?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, clearly the appetite for moving that forward will somewhat depend upon the outcome of the election in early November. However my sense is that there are some democratic legislators depending upon the use of the proceeds from the sale that could be very supportive of the sale. So, I'm not sure this is really a hugely part as an issue going forward and some of the support for the concept of selling the State owned power plants may well lie in, what would the governor intend to do with these one-time proceeds?","Daniel Jenkins \u2013 State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And just to go back a little bit on what you're seeing, particularly from the manufacturing side. First, I just want to clarify on the ones that are doing self-generation. When do you expect that you won't be seeing the year-over-year impact on that? When did those kind of go off system so that the \u2026","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I think we've seen the impact on -- I'm looking at Scott Lauber and he\u2019s agreeing. I believe we've seen about the impact that we expect to see and we'll see it in this year's numbers. Comparisons next year should not have any further impact from the two customers or if so modest, very modest.","Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So starting first quarter or what \u2026","Gale E. Klappa","Yeah, starting first quarter.","Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then just, one thing I don't know how closely you look at this, but I noticed today the Milwaukee Purchasing Managers Index was down quite a bit. And I was wondering how much, if you know that has much correlation to what you see from the people you provide service to as far as a way to kind of get a sense on what's going on in the large manufacturers?","Gale E. Klappa","I wouldn\u2019t necessary place a ton of weight on that in terms of its influence on our large manufacturing customer base. What we look at, and we do this every week. We see a report that shows what is happening with our large industrial customers every single week and we look at it from the standpoint of latest four weeks compared to the prior four weeks. Latest 13 weeks compared to the 13 weeks of a year ago, and then week-to-week. So we have a very good reporting system that keeps us very much in tune with what's happening with our largest industrial customers. And right now, I think the bottom-line of what we're seeing is flat overall.","Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then the last thing I was just wondering, you mentioned that one of the big differences in the cash from operations had to do with the pension funding. I was wondering if you'd give us a little color on what you expect on the pension funding going forward.","Gale E. Klappa","We\u2019ll let Pat give you the answer on that one.","J. Patrick Keyes","Sure, Dan. Few thoughts on the pension funding. First of all, we had a contribution plan in 2013 and we just pulled it forward. So that's one of the explanations I guess. Second, we are anticipating that our discount rate at the end of the year is going to be lower than it is right now. So, in round numbers, we're just over 5% now and based on all the latest actuarial assumptions I've seen we'll probably end up under 4%, so that drove up the size of our liability and drove the contribution. And I guess the third point would be, we kind of choose the $100 million based on all of the best knowledge we've got now that projects us out to be 100% funded at the end of the year.","Gale E. Klappa","And Dan, to Pat\u2019s last point. I think you'll find we\u2019re one of the few large companies around that will be fully funded on their pension liabilities.","Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa","You are welcome Dan. Behave now.","Daniel Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","I\u2019ll try.","Gale E. Klappa","All right.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.","Hi, good afternoon.","Gale E. Klappa","Hi, Andy. How are you?","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.","Good. How are you?","Gale E. Klappa","Fine.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.","Just real quick question, most of mine have been answered. But if you could kind of opine on your ability to manage O&M costs in 2013, '14 outside of those additional O&M related to your additional capital investments that have been put in place?","Gale E. Klappa","On our ability to manage our O&M costs?","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.","Correct.","Gale E. Klappa","We've proven to be very effective, very strong, very capable at managing our O&M costs, and I don't think that will change in any way, shape or form","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.","Okay, but I mean in 2013, '14 you would expect to be able to keep O&M relatively flat outside of those additional capital investments?","Gale E. Klappa","Meaning outside of the O&M we needed to have for the additional people to run those additional \u2013 the additional assets. The answer is yes.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Operator","Our next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP Capital.","Gale E. Klappa","Hi, Vedula. Long time no talk to.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital","Hey nice to talk to you, Gale. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa","You are welcome. How\u2019s it going?","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital","I\u2019m doing okay. Basically to follow-up on Paul Patterson\u2019s line of questioning, I think almost certain was that, but when you get to the next rate cycle can you kind of discuss a little bit on how much right now of your returning rates are kind of on the fixed tariff as opposed to volumetric at this point and do you want to kind of transition over maybe a little higher percentage to get away from volumetric risk or do you think if you can kind of tell us kind of where you\u2019re at there and whether it's kind of a good mix right now in terms of balancing the opportunity benefit from sales growth and that type of thing versus protection, and that type of thing?","Gale E. Klappa","Good question, Vedula. I don\u2019t believe we have in the room with us the exact percentages of the breakdown of rates. How much is in fixed charges, how much is volumetric. We can certainly get that for you and call you back after the call, but in our current rate case, we are asking, I believe for some adjustment upward in the fixed charges. And again the specific percentage breakdown we don't have in the room with us, but it's a matter of public record and we can certainly get that to you later this afternoon.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital","Yeah, but basically the point is though that\u2019s something that you\u2019re working towards in terms of moving away or diminishing the volumetric component?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, clearly with the \u2013 with what we\u2019ve asked for in terms of modest adjustments in our rate structures and the rate case. We think it would be helpful to move in that direction, meaning a bit away from volumetric and more toward the fixed charge. So the answer is yes.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital","Okay. Thank you very much.","Gale E. Klappa","You\u2019re welcome, Vedula. Take care. All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen that concludes our conference call for today.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman and Interim Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group. Mr. Klappa, the floor is yours.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sarah, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review our performance for the third quarter of this year. Now, before we dive into our update this afternoon, I'd like to take just a moment to thank you for the incredible outpouring of prayers and support and good wishes for Allen Leverett following his stroke earlier this month. I can tell you that Allen has been released from the hospital and is making progress in his recovery. I will continue to serve as Interim Chief Executive for as long as necessary, but the ultimate goal is obviously to bring Allen back. But again, your kindness and concern have meant a great deal to Allen and his family and a great deal to all of us as well. My thanks.","Now, I'd like to introduce the members of our senior team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","We'll begin with our third quarter results. As I am sure you saw from our new release this morning, we reported third quarter earnings of $0.68 a share. We delivered a solid third quarter, largely driven by effective cost controls. Our focus on cost management and efficiency gains was a major factor in offsetting the impact of mild summer weather compared to last year's third quarter. Those cool temperatures were particularly noticeable during August, which is normally one of the two warmest months in the Midwest.","Next, I'd like to brief you on several developments on the regulatory front and on our capital investments. On August 10, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission unanimously approved our proposed rate settlement. We received our final written order on September 8.","Under the approved settlement, base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities will remain flat for 2018 and for 2019. In total, this will keep base rates flat for four years and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019.","The earnings sharing mechanisms that have been in place will be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas and a similar mechanism will now be in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. Now, just a reminder, customers and stockholders share equally in the first 50 basis points of earnings above our allowed rate of return. Anything above the first 50 basis points will flow completely to customers.","Now as part of the agreement, we've also expanded and made permanent certain pricing options for our large electric customers. These options will continue to help many of our customers grow their businesses, create jobs and reduce their energy costs.","Turning to Michigan. I'm pleased to report that we obtained final regulatory approval just yesterday for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. We also received all local approvals that are needed to move forward with the project.","Our plan is to bring those facilities into commercial service in 2019 and at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle. The approved project calls for a $265 million investment in reciprocating internal combustion engines. They will be capable of generating up to 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by our utility subsidiary in Michigan, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, provide a long-term generation solution for customers in the Upper Peninsula and that includes the iron ore mine owned by Cleveland Cliffs.","And now, for an update on Illinois. We continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas system modernization program. Since we acquired Peoples Gas, we've made significant improvements in a number of important metrics. We've lowered contractor construction cost by 15%. We've achieved a 70% decline in customer complaints. Construction timelines have been reduced by more than 25% and I'm pleased to say that our working relationship with the City of Chicago is greatly improved. Our system modernization program, as you've heard, is designed to make the gas distribution network in Chicago safer, more reliable, less expensive to maintain. As you may recall, we still have an open docket (5:54) on the preferred approach to this long-term project.","We expect a decision by the Illinois Commerce Commission by year-end. And consistent with our 2017 plan, we're on track to invest approximately $300 million on the effort in Chicago this year.","Turning now to our operations in Minnesota. On October 13, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. We're seeking to increase natural gas base rates by $12.6 million or approximately 5%. We've also requested under the procedures available in Minnesota, to self-implement an increase of $9.5 million or 3.8%, effective January 1 of 2018. A final decision on new permanent rates is not expected until the first quarter of 2019.","I'd also like to update you on a recent FERC decision related to the System Support Resource payments for the Presque Isle power plant in Michigan. In its decision, FERC ordered a refund of $22.6 million associated with the payments that we received for the period February of 2014 through January of 2015. As you may recall, this is very close to the amount that the administrative law judge recommended last year. So consistent with our previous statements, the amount of the refund will not result in a dollar-for-dollar reduction in net income and we have taken the FERC decision into account for our year-end guidance.","Next, I'd like to remind everyone that we will be rolling out our new five-year capital forecast at the EEI Finance Conference in early November. Over the past few months, Allen shared the developing plan with me in my role as Chairman of the board. In the past few weeks, I've of course reviewed the capital plan in great detail and I share Allen's optimism about the direction of the plan. Now, one piece of that new five-year plan has just been put in place. Our Wisconsin Public Service Utility in Green Bay, along with Wisconsin Power and Light and Madison Gas and Electric have purchased the Forward Wind Energy Center from Invenergy. The total purchase price is approximately $174 million. We will own 44.6% of the facility with an investment of approximately $78 million. Forward consists of 86 GE wind turbines with a capacity of about 130 megawatts. The wind farm is located 10 miles south of Fond du Lac in the eastern part of the state. If approved, Wisconsin Public Service customers will see real savings, because we will be able to eliminate the existing power purchase agreement. Pending regulatory approvals, closing on the Forward Wind Center could take place next spring. Again, we look forward to sharing more about our new five-year capital plan at EEI and we really look forward to the opportunities that lie ahead.","And speaking of opportunity, you may have heard about the blockbuster announcement this summer, the announcement that Foxconn has chosen Wisconsin for one of the largest economic development projects in American history. Based on revenue, Foxconn is the fourth largest tech company in the world. And Foxconn has decided to bring a brand-new technology called 8K to the United States. The company plans to invest $10 billion to build a massive production plant that could employ as many as 13,000 people in Racine County just south of Milwaukee. We expect the electric demand from this Foxconn campus to be more than 200 megawatts, that's approximately three times the size of our current largest Wisconsin customer. And that does not include the demand that will develop from the suppliers that will also need to locate near the Foxconn facility.","Foxconn has chosen a site in southeastern Wisconsin that is perfectly situated on our transmission network. We will not need to build any new generation. Our state-of-the-art network is well-equipped today to provide reliable, low-cost energy to Foxconn.","Now, on top of that, folks, if you like gummy bears, and you know who doesn't, I have more news for you. The German candymaker, Haribo, has also selected Wisconsin for its first-ever manufacturing facility in North America. So, as you can see, the manufacturing economy in Wisconsin is alive and well.","And now, with details on our third quarter results and our outlook for the remainder of 2017, here's our esteemed Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Gale. Our GAAP earnings were unchanged from the third quarter of 2016 at $0.68 per share. You may recall that our 2016 third quarter earnings included $0.01 of acquisition costs. Excluding these costs, our adjusted earnings were $0.69 in the third quarter of 2016. Our results were primarily driven by a return to normal weather conditions, offset by positive impact of cost control. Weather in 2016 was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of third quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results, both GAAP and adjusted. There were no adjustments made to GAAP earnings in 2017.","My focus will be on the quarter, beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes.","Referring to page 9 of the earning packet, our consolidated operating income in the third quarter of 2017 was $393.6 million compared to the adjusted $402.5 million in the third quarter of 2016, a decrease of $8.9 million.","Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income decreased $19.4 million quarter-over-quarter. Lower margin was driven by a return to normal weather and a normal fuel recovery pattern. This was offset by operations and maintenance expense that was $39.9 million lower compared to the third quarter of 2016.","Last year, we recorded $18.6 million in operations and maintenance expense related to the earnings-sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas. In the third quarter of 2017, Our Illinois segment recognized an operating income increase of $800,000 compared to the third quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by continued investment in the gas system modernization program.","As expected, operating loss in our Other States segment increased $2.1 million, driven by higher depreciation and amortization expense, resulting from an increase in capital investments in our gas distribution utilities.","Turning now to our Non-Utility Energy Infrastructure segment. As a reminder, this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30 of this year, as well as the results of the Power the Future plans. For the third quarter, operating income in this segment was up $9.7 million. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $5.9 million to operating income in 2017. Operating income from our Power the Future plans increased $3.8 million, reflecting the additional investment at these plans since the third quarter of 2016.","Operating income at our Corporate and Other segment was $1.1 million for the third quarter of 2017, an increase of $2.1 million from the adjusted operating loss in the third quarter of 2016. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $8.9 million decrease in adjusted operating income. During the third quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $39.2 million, an increase of $900,000 compared to the same quarter of 2016.","Other income net increased by $8.9 million quarter-over-quarter. This was largely due to two items; higher investment gains related to our deferred compensation plan and we incurred losses in our third quarter of 2016 related to the disposition of some non-utility assets. Interest expense increased $4.7 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily driven by an increase in debt levels resulting from continued capital investments.","Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect that our effective income tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. Combining all these items brings us to earnings of $215.4 million or $0.68 per share for the third quarter of 2017 compared to adjusted earnings of $219.1 million or $0.69 per share for the third quarter of 2016.","For the year-to-date, adjusted earnings increased $0.07 to $2.43 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2017, compared to an adjusted $2.36 per share for the nine months ended September 30, 2016. This was largely due to cost control and efficiency gains.","Looking at the cash flow statement at page 7 of the earnings package, net cash provided by operating activities increased $24.8 million during the nine months ended September 30, 2017 compared to the same period in 2016. A reduction in working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017. Our capital expenditures totaled $1.3 billion for the first nine months of 2017, a $309.1 million increase compared to the same period in 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure.","Our debt to capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of September, unchanged from the end of 2016. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity, we are using cash to satisfy any shares required in our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. We paid $492.4 million in common stock dividends during the first nine months of 2017, an increase of $23.8 million over the same period last year.","Moving to sales, we see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of September, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 18,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 13 and 14 of the earnings package, on a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, normalized sales results for natural gas were slightly above our expectations and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations.","Turning now to our earnings forecasts, we are reaffirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.","With that, I'll turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Scott, thank you very much. We're on track and, as always, focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. And operator, I believe we're ready for the Q&A portion of the call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right. Thank you. Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Afternoon, guys.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Shar, how are you?","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Good, how are you?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We're doing well.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Just really one question for today, with Presque Isle, you're roughly 7 million tons short of what your internal target is. Is there any sort of updates that you can provide on sort of additional coal retirements, and maybe looking at some of the assets like North Oak (18:49) or Pleasant Prairie and sort of how are you thinking about that?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, I can tell you that we have a generation restructuring plan under review, and we'll be able to provide you with a lot more detail when we roll out our five-year capital forecast at EEI.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Okay. Got it. I'll wait \u2013 we'll wait till EEI. Scott, definitely give our best wishes again to Allen for a speedy recovery.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you very much. We appreciate it.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from Julien Dumoulin-Smith from Bank of America.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Julien. How are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Hey, good. Good. Again, I want to echo Shar's comments. Please do send our best to Allen, or Allen, if you're listening, all the best. Wanted to touch base quickly on the O&M reductions, clearly the team's done an incredible job year-to-date. Can you comment a little bit on the drivers of this and thoughts into the years ahead on the cadence of the reduction? And then, perhaps, in tandem with that, I'd love to hear your thoughts on recovery, from a regulatory perspective, of the latest investment you all are talking about on the wind side, just given the stayout (20:00), et cetera?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay. Sure. Well, I'll frame the answer for you and will let Scott provide some additional detail. But in terms of the \u2013 and the team has done a great job on O&M reduction, much of the O&M reduction that we're seeing here is from efficiency gains, not just one-time cost controls. And a lot of what we're seeing is really enabled by the fact that at the end of June of 2015 we acquired Integrys and we're ahead of plan clearly in terms of cost savings resulting from the acquisition. Most all of the cost savings that we've seen so far through the first nine months of this year, Scott, are really from our Wisconsin operations.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","It's actually been Wisconsin was mainly in this third quarter, but across all the enterprise; Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota and Michigan, all the utilities contributed. Each one of our operations managers and vice presidents have plans in place to continue to take costs out of the business. So, we continue to see even next year taking additional cost out in future years.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And we're seeing \u2013 Scott is exactly right. I think you're going to continue to see efficiency gains and cost reductions going forward. A lot of it, I think, is going to come from the generation side of our business and we'll talk a lot more about that as we roll out the new five-year capital plan. But we see continuing good opportunity, really strong opportunity for ongoing cost reduction, Julien.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And then the second part of the question was talking about our new investment in the wind farm and those \u2013 that Forward Wind investment, we already have those costs are included in rates. So, it's already part of a purchase power agreement and we're just converting it to an asset-earning investment versus a purchase power agreement.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","So rather than an O&M expense that flows through fuel, basically, we've converted that or will convert that upon closing, as Scott said, to an earning assets that will actually reduce cost for customers.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","Right. So, technically, that couples back into the first question here around the cadence of costs, you've delineated yet another point into next year. In fact, actually, if I could kind of press you a little bit further, are there opportunities like this one to convert fuel expense into earning assets? This seems pretty novel.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, why don't we just say this, stay tuned, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - Bank of America Merrill Lynch","There we go. Excellent. Well, all the best. I hope to see you all soon. And again, Allen, all the \u2013 best of luck with the recovery.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Perfect. Thank you so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Afternoon, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Afternoon, Gale. I wish I could say, I'm hearing your voice under different circumstances. Always enjoy hearing your voice. Please pass along my thoughts to Allen and the family.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","I have a question. It's interesting. Wisconsin has made a lot of progress in terms of the utilities across the state, meeting the Renewable Portfolio Standards. And yet, if you did a screen of states that are still very coal-heavy, Wisconsin would show up in the top tier of U.S. states. How do you think this changes for the state as a whole and for your utilities in the state over the next five to seven years? And what do you think the types of resources are that drive that to change? And how does this fit given what \u2013 given the utilities are largely already in compliance with the Renewable Portfolio Standard?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, it's a good question, Michael. Let me try to give you two or three thoughts on that. First of all, I really can only speak about our utilities, which would be We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay. But when you look at the broader picture, remember, we have set a goal to reduce carbon emissions by essentially 40% by the year 2030 off 2005 levels. We believe we can do that without significant rate pressure because of what's occurred with the improvement and the efficiency and the cost of some renewables. Believe it or not, I mean when you when you look at just what's happened with the efficiency of the utility scale solar, I mean, even three or four years ago for Wisconsin, you might see, oh gosh, $4,000 a megawatt installed \u2013 cost of $4,000 a megawatt installed for a large utility scale solar plant in Wisconsin. That's today down to circa $1,300. So, what's going to be driving the restructuring of generation portfolios, not just in our state, but elsewhere, particularly where they're coal heavy, is really economics. And we're seeing significant economic changes that will allow us to add more renewables to our fleet.","In part we're able to do that and not put pressure on rates, because we already have a state-of-the-art backbone, if you will, from the Power the Future units that we've already built and are in place. So, I think we're very well-positioned to continue to take costs out, to continue to reduce carbon emissions. But at the end of the day, I mean the company's goal is really to maintain a diverse fuel supply, less of coal \u2013 clearly, less of coal. But at the end of the day, we probably, 10 or 15 years from now, will look like a third, a third, a third. Basically, a third coal or a third fossil fuel, a third renewables, third natural gas. Does that help at all, Michael?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","That helps a lot. Thank you for that. I know that's a little bit of a longer-term question, so I appreciate answering that as well as you possibly can, given what's in the public domain. I have one for, Scott, and this is a question of \u2013 I mean, I think if I were to take a poll of investors, most people think coming at EEI either this year or next year or some future year, your capital budgets will move higher, there is more renewable investment coming, there is more other investment coming. I guess the question really, I'd ask you, Scott, is how much balance sheet capacity do you think the company has, whether it's for incremental rate base growth or you've shown the ability to successfully integrate another company, whether it'd be incremental M&A? How are you thinking about the strength of the balance sheet and how much room or excess capacity the current balance sheet has?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. That's a good question, Michael. And when we look at it, we're looking at it in a couple of metrics, we look at our holding company debt as a percent of total debt, keeping it under 30%, but remember that's funding the equity, that's making good utility return investments. So we're looking at that. And we look at our FFO to debt at that 16 to 19 range, and looking at our plans and the plan we talk about at EEI, we'll roll it out, we're going to be comfortable in those ranges with no additional shares being issued.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC","Got it. Okay, guys. Thank you. Much appreciated, guys.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Take care, Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi. Good afternoon.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Dan, you're back?","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Yeah.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","About that life coach stuff I was offering you, now that I'm sitting in for Allen, be happy to try to guide you, because I know you probably got a little off-track in the last year or so.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Yeah, I've just been kind of lost in the woods.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. Exactly. So, any help I can give you, just let me know.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. I appreciate that. And I would also like to echo the best wishes to Allen in his recovery.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Dan. We'll certainly pass your goodwill along.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. I had a question kind of around the current tax reform proposals and debate in terms of, have you thought at all about \u2013 I know you have amount of (28:28) maturities in \u2013 I think $550 million in June in next year, along with $800 million or so of short-term debt. Have you thought at all about there's been some proposals to eliminate interest deduction, but grandfathering in current debt. Has there been any thought of doing any pre-funding of any of those maturities or short-term debt to try to lock in the deductibility of those interest expenses?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Dan, we thought, first of all, you might buy up all the non-deductible stuff. No, that's not true. Let me say this, that the whole picture related to interest deductibility, bonus depreciation, the whole picture is pretty murky right now. I mean, we've obviously had some very good discussions with the tax writing people in the House. Of course, Paul Ryan is very involved in the crafting of the legislation. But it is just way too early to think about a pre-funding or think about any change in our plan. We're going to have to see, first of all, whether tax reform actually gets completed and then what the real details are.","And there's some thought that there might be an optional election on interest deductibility with a trade-off on another tax deduction item. We just have to see. At this point, I think anything that \u2013 I mean we're obviously looking at the landscape, but anything that I might tell you would be pure speculation until we really understand the details, I understand the House passed a budget today which raises the percentage possibility that tax reform will actually take place. But we're just going to have to see the details and then we'll figure out where to go.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then I was wondering if you could just give us a little more color on, particularly the industrial demand picture. I noticed that was down again and that should be less impacted by weather than the other classes. Other than the Foxconn and the mines, what you're seeing from your other industrial customer demand?","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We'll be happy to do that. And I'll ask Scott to chime in as well. Let me just say this \u2013 and you've heard me say this before. On a very short-term basis, I'm quite skeptical of our ability to weather normalize accurately. And you are correct, industrial demand should be less weather sensitive than any other group of customers, but there's still some weather sensitivity. So, I think we need to look over a much longer period of time than just one quarter versus a comparison to another quarter where it was 43% warmer than normal. So, I wouldn't be overly-concerned, one way or another, about one quarter's results. But we are seeing some, what Scott calls, green shoots in three or four specific industry sectors and we'll let Scott tell you about those.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So \u2013 exactly, Gale. So, as we mentioned before, we track this information on a daily and quarterly basis, looking at this. And we're starting to see a couple areas of some growth. We have basically four sectors; the food and food products sector, the paper products area, actually rubber and plastics, and another sector that just kind of showed up this quarter is fabricating metal. So encouraged by what we're starting to see in these individual sectors and hopefully that growth continues as we move forward here.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And for what it's worth, and Scott and I have talked about this, the Foxconn demand growth \u2013 the demand growth we'll see from Foxconn and demand growth we'll see from Haribo and several of the other really good economic development projects that have come to fruition, we haven't yet put those in our numbers. So, for example, Foxconn, I wouldn't think, would affect our industrial sales until probably 2020. And then, they'll ramp up, obviously, from the start. But our projections today really do not include any of those recent developments. Correct, Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. That is correct. We're still just being very conservative to make sure that we have the appropriate efficiency gains to be able to do our capital investments, but there's potential upside here.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","And it wouldn't surprise you that Scott and Allen are being very conservative.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're welcome, Dan.","Operator","And there are no further questions at this time.","Gale E. Klappa - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","All right. Thank you very much.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Charlene. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the first quarter of the year. But before I do that, I want to introduce the members of our team who are here with me today. I'm pleased to welcome Scott Lauber as our new Chief Financial Officer. Many of you know Scott from his previous role as our Treasurer, but before that he had a number of other roles in our accounting and finance organization.","Now Scott is taking over from Pat Keyes. Pat is now responsible for our operations in Michigan and Minnesota, as well as supply chain, information technology and strategy for WEC Energy Group as a whole. I also welcome Jim Schubilske as our new Treasurer. Like Scott, Jim has held numerous positions in our accounting and finance organization and he was most recently responsible for our State Regulatory area. Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and Beth Straka, who is Senior Vice President, leads our Corporate Communications and Investor Relations Groups are also here with me.","So with that, let me now turn to our first quarter 2016 results. WEC Energy Group was formed in conjunction with the closing of our acquisition of Integrys in June of last year. Until now, we have focused our discussion on Legacy Wisconsin Energy standalone results. Starting today, our focus shifts to the entire company's results.","We reported first quarter earnings of $1.09 a share that compares with adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share in the first quarter of 2015. Scott will be reviewing the most significant drivers for the quarter with you in a moment.","Now taking a look at the state of the economy for our largest segment, Wisconsin's unemployment rate stands at 4.5%, which is well below the national average. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68.7%, which is more than 5 points above the national rate. Also worthy of note, Wisconsin led the nation in adding manufacturing jobs in March. Electricity used by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. Our electric utility's large customers, excluding the iron ore mines consumed approximately 0.8% less electricity in the first quarter compared to 2015. However, we continue to see improvement in several important sectors of the state's economy including plastics, food processing and paper production.","In addition, we are continuing to see customer growth across our system. At the end of March, our Wisconsin utilities were serving approximately 8,000 more electric customers, and nearly 11,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota added nearly 16,000 customers in the past year. This increase includes the acquisition of approximately 10,000 natural gas customers in Minnesota from Alliant Energy in April of 2015.","We are achieving the results we expected from the Integrys acquisition. Our focus on cost controls and the tangible benefits from the acquisition have allowed us to freeze base rates for customers of We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service through 2017. Subject to Public Service Commission of Wisconsin action, which is not expected, we will not file 2017 test year base rate cases this year for our Wisconsin utilities.","As we have discussed on previous calls, our long-term goal is to grow earnings per share at a compound annual growth rate of 5% to 7% of a base of $2.72 per share in 2015. Here of course to delivering this growth is executing our capital investment plan and addressing the impact of bonus tax depreciation.","I want to give you a brief update on where we stand with our capital plan. Last December, Congress passed a tax bill that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we will receive approximately $1 billion in cash tax benefits from the bonus depreciation extension, about two-thirds of this benefit will occur this year and in 2017. Although, we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any significant impact on earnings in 2016, we are taking steps to modify our capital plan to minimize any impacts in 2017 and following years. We have advanced a number of beneficial projects into 2016 and 2017. The estimated investment associated with these projects is $500 million, which includes the $100 million that we previously identified in the February call.","As a result, we now forecast our 2016 and 2017 capital budgets at $1.55 billion and $1.9 billion respectively. I expect that we will continue to identify projects that can be advanced into our current five-year forecast. We plan to provide a complete update to our five-year capital forecast no later than the November EEI Financial Conference.","Turning now to our operations in Illinois, we're moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program or AMRP at Peoples Gas, one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging natural gas infrastructure.","Over the past nine months, we've improved management and execution of the project, which is approximately 18% complete. We filed a plan with the Illinois Commerce Commission or ICC late last year that describes our top priorities for the next three years. The plan's key components include removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast-iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk, projected investment of $250 million to $280 million a year, and regular updates to the ICC and other stakeholders to keep them informed of our progress. While the engineering, fieldwork, and cost recovery of AMRP continued, the ICC held six workshops to assess our plan. These recently concluded workshops brought together key stakeholders to review the planned scope, schedule and long-term cost with a focus on safety and reliability. We expect that the ICC staff will issue its report late in May and that the ICC will reach its conclusions by the end of the year. However, in the interim, the AMRP work will continue.","Next, a brief reminder on our dividend. On January 21, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate stands at $1.98 a share and our yield is now at approximately the industry average. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings, and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with our earnings per share growth.","Before I ask Scott to review the details of our first quarter earnings, I want to cover one last item. I met with quite a number of investors and analysts, and including many of you over the last few months after our management transition was announced. Quite often I've been asked, Allen what will be different when you are a CEO. Now it's really easier for me to tell all of you what will be the same. Our company will continue to focus on the fundamentals, safety, customer satisfaction, reliability and financial discipline. I believe this focus has served us well since I joined the company in 2003, and will continue to do so.","So, now for more details on our first quarter results, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Allen. Our 2016 first quarter GAAP earnings were $1.09 a share compared with $0.86 a share in the first quarter of 2015. First quarter results in 2016 included the positive impact of the Integrys acquisition. Excluding $0.04 of acquisition cost in 2015, our adjusted earnings per share increased by $0.19 a share from $0.90 in the first quarter of 2015 to $1.09 a share in the first quarter of 2016. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.","First, I'll focus on operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $589.3 million as compared to an adjusted $367.6 million in 2015, an increase of $221.7 million.","Starting with Wisconsin, operating income in the first quarter totaled $327.5 million for 2016, an increase of $50 million from the adjusted first quarter of 2015. On the favorable side, we realized $76.9 million contribution from Wisconsin Public Service. This was offset by lower operating income from Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas related to the mild winter temperatures. We estimate that electric and gas margins of these two utilities decreased by $29 million because of the warmer weather.","In the first quarter of 2016, our Illinois segment added $137 million of operating income and our other state segment added $31.8 million of operating income. We did not have operations in these segments until our acquisition of Integrys.","Operating income in the We Power segment was up $800,000 when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investments at our Power the Future plants. Our Corporate and other segment showed an operating loss of $300,000 this quarter as compared to an adjusted operating loss of $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2015.","Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at the $221.7 million increase in operating income on an adjusted basis.","During the first quarter of 2016, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $38.5 million, an increase of $22.4 million from the same period last year. This increase is directly related to the increase on our ownership interest from about 26% to just over 60% as a result of the acquisition of Integrys.","Our other net increased $29.7 million, largely due to repurchase of $155 million of Integrys' 6.11% Junior Subordinated Notes at a discount in February 2016, as well as higher AFUDC due to the inclusion of the AFUDC from the Integrys companies.","Our net interest expense increased $41.5 million, driven by $34.8 million of interest expense from Integrys companies in 2016. In addition, we incurred about $8 million of interest expense related to the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the Integrys acquisition.","Earnings from the Integrys company drove an increase in our consolidated income tax expense of $90.2 million. There were no significant changes in our effective income tax rate. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2016 to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings us to $346.2 million of net income for the first quarter of 2016 or earnings of $1.09 per share.","Net cash provided by operating activities increased $365.9 million in the first quarter of 2016. This increase was driven by $307.8 million of net cash flow from operating activities of Integrys during the first quarter of 2016. The remaining difference was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans partially offset by changes in working capital.","You may recall that we contributed a $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. Our capital expenditures totaled $312 million in the first quarter, a $158.8 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to the Integrys companies.","Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 50.4% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of the hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","We also paid $156.2 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2016, an increase of $60.9 billion over the first quarter last year. This is driven by the increase in shares with the Integrys acquisition, and a 17.2% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first quarter in 2015.","For comparative purposes, the electric sales information I'll discuss next reflects for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service in the first quarter. Weather-normalized sales are adjusted for the effects of weather and factoring out the effect of leap year. On a weather-normalized basis, retail sales of electricity, excluding the iron ore mines, were down slightly by 0.2% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 1.6%.","Now looking at the individual customer segments. Weather-normalized residential deliveries dropped 0.3% while actual residential deliveries fell 4.2%. Across our small and commercial industrial group, weather-normalized quarterly deliveries increased 1.5%, actual deliveries decreased 0.2%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2016 decreased 0.9%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries decreased 0.8%.","Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and our margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, decreased 1% compared to the same period in 2015. Actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas for power generation, were down 10.7% compared to gas sales in last year's first quarter due to warmer weather. On a weather-normalized basis, our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter were slightly below our expectations.","Turning now to our earnings forecasts. We are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share, which represents 6% to 8% growth. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related cost. We are off to a strong start, but still have nine months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our 2016 earnings guidance of $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share.","Finally, let's look at the outlook for quarterly earnings for the remainder of the year. If we take a step back, we see new a quarterly pattern to earnings per share. The Integrys acquisition brings a larger gas component to the combined company. This means we expect to see relatively higher earnings per share in the first and fourth quarter due to gas heating margins and relatively lower earnings per share in the second and third quarter when compared to past years.","This brings us to our second quarter earnings per share guidance. Taking into account this new quarterly earnings pattern and April being a little cooler than last year, we expect our second quarter 2016 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.51 to $0.55. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related cost. Again, the second quarter earnings guidance is $0.51 to $0.55 per share.","With that, I will turn things back to Allen.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Scott. I think, overall, we're solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Hey, guys. Congratulations, Allen.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","So thanks for the update on the CapEx. I'm looking at slide 14 from your April business update.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","And so you've taken your CapEx for 2016 to $1.55 billion versus $1.499 billion and you've taken your 2017 CapEx to $1.9 billion from $1.553 billion. Can you just review again what capital projects you've brought forward and if we should assume that that capital comes out of the 2018 to 2020 budget? Or are you also reevaluating customer beneficial projects that you could put in, move forward such that those would stay relatively level?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Okay. Greg, so, if I could, let me answer your second question, and then Scott, I'm going to ask you maybe to give Greg a little bit of color about the types of projects that we're advancing. So, Greg, on your second question, you should not assume that the increases that we're making in the 2016 and 2017 spending would result in a corresponding decrease in the later years, because we're also revaluating those later years. So, Scott, if you could, maybe just give Greg a little more background about some of the things that we're advancing.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Sure. Just to give you a few examples, over these last couple of months, we looked across the enterprise. And for example, we are looking and we are going to implement a neat \u2013 updating our ERP system, the general ledger, consolidations, so that part of the general ledger and that could be up to $100 million. Another example is, we looked at Wisconsin, the gas and electric distribution system, and we're increasing that about $150 million on value-added customer projects. And then, another area when we look at, in Illinois, we have a large gas storage facility, underground storage in Illinois, and we're going to spend about $35 million over the next couple of years, looking at safety reliability within that storage field. So, basically across the enterprise found some good projects to bring up and move forward into this period.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Great. And because of the impact of bonus depreciation, that doesn't really have a net \u2013 it's a net-neutral impact on what the customer would otherwise see in terms of bill impacts, correct?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","The capital costs?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","That's correct.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Fantastic. And can you give us what a comparable pro forma theoretical quarterly earnings number would have been last year in the second quarter had you owned Integrys, so we could compare the $0.51 to $0.55 to that?","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","We looked at this at a very, very high level trying to take out all the acquisition adjustments and adjusting really just for the shares outstanding. It was about $0.53 \u2013 $0.52, $0.53.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Okay. So it's going to be a little bit difficult for us as we roll through the year to get our minds around the new base of earnings. But would it be fair to say that as you stand today, if you were to assume normal weather and you were spot on your load growth forecast for the year that you are at the high end, low end, above, below your current guidance range for the year?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would say at this point, I mean, if you take it sort of \u2013 if you look at what happened with the hybrids in the first quarter, that was in our annual plan. It was just uncertain as to when in the year it would occur. So that certainly would not represent a pickup versus the financial plan.","I think another significant driver, Scott, was related to fuel recoveries in Wisconsin where we had positive fuel recoveries in the first quarter. But our assumption for the year, Greg, would be that we would just be fully recovered. So I think given those two things, I would say that we're sort of more at the middle of our range. And as I look at it, we're sort of neutral against our financial plan. If you adjust for the items in the first quarter that I either expect would reverse in the case of the fuel recoveries or I had already included in the annual plan, it was just an uncertainty about the timing.","Greg Gordon - Evercore Group LLC","Fantastic. Thank you, gentlemen.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Allen. Congrats again. So just on the rate case delay, can you give us a sense of whether kind of staff is supportive of that, if other parties have had a view, and when will we know when the commission is kind of okay with it?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think it in terms of the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin staff, they're okay with it, and they've indicated that to us in writing that they're in agreement with it. So, at this point, Steve, the commission itself, they don't have to take any action at all for there not to be a rate case. So, my expectation at this point, as I was saying in the prepared remarks, my expectation would be, we wouldn't file a case for base rates in 2017 \u2013 for 2017. However, I would expect, Steve, that in August, we would do a fuel filing for 2017 rates, and say more likely than not we might see a slight reduction in the fuel rate, but we'll have to look at our numbers when we file in August.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. I thought you said in your prepared remarks not file 2017 subject to PSC approval.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","No. I didn't say subject to approval. I said subject to any PSC action. And so, just to be clear, they don't have to take any affirmative action here. So, if they do nothing, which would be my expectation, they wouldn't take an action, we wouldn't have a rate case.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And I assume what you are doing is utilizing merger synergies to help mitigate what would have been the rate needs.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Right. So, when we went through the process with the merger approval, we talked about the ability to get what we felt would be reasonably significant cost savings and we're seeing those materialize. And so that allows us to freeze base rates, which we think is a benefit to customers.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jonathan.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys. Could I just ask you to give us a little bit of a bridge between the $130-odd-million that Integrys booked in the first quarter of last year and the $160-odd-million that you have this quarter? Just what were the moving pieces?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","So, Scott, I think I'll let you, maybe based on the earnings package just give Jonathan a little bit of background. But I will say this, Jonathan, if you look across the Integrys companies, I think we really have these companies on track to all earn their allowed rates of return. So that's part of the difference that you saw as compared to the first quarter of 2015.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Scott, do you want to fill in a little bit on that?","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, also when we look at it, we had a full-year rate case at PGL. So, at our Illinois utility, there was a rate case that was effective I think in February of last year. So, we had a full rate earnings in there. We also had a rate case at Wisconsin Public Service, so that was also an increase. And remember, there's two pieces to the Wisconsin Public Service there was an overall it looked flat, but one of that was a fuel, but there was a base rate increase, so that came through. Once again, Allen talked about the fuel \u2013 the positive recovery in fuel and some of that was in the Wisconsin Public Service area too compared to prior year. We also had rate cases that were implemented at our smaller gas utilities in Michigan and Minnesota, both of those had rate increases this last year. So, basically getting the rate increases in, getting the cost control in, and getting on a path to get to the full return at all the utilities.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great, thank you. And then just on \u2013 I think that when you gave the second quarter guidance, I think I heard you right, you said that April had been a little cooler than normal in the context of the new gas year business mix. So is that a help or a hurt versus normal?","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","That's a great question. April is a transition month and so, in April, we're not really getting a lot of gas sales. It does help the gas a little bit. But on the electric side, April is a month when you get that commercial industrial buildings that actually uses some air conditioning. So, having a mile month here, we really don't \u2013 we see that little more of a down on our earnings more from the electric side not picking in yet than the gas side picking up the offset.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I mean, you called it out, but I'm guessing it's not that significant given it's April.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. No, it's $2 million to $3 million, maybe.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Jon.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. Hey, Allen. Couple of things. First of all, on a cents-per-share basis, the increase in other income related to the early pay-down at a discount of some of the Integrys debt, that's worth, what, roughly $0.05 to $0.06 in EPS?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me maybe talk about it in two pieces, Michael. Of course, we bought the securities I think at approximately 83% of par, so that resulted in a $0.04 per share impact in the first quarter. And they were repurchased, say, mid February, so there was a tiny bit of interest savings, Michael, in the first quarter, but very little, probably less than a tenth of a cent, but if you look forward to the rest of the year, we would expect to see another $0.01 per share benefit because of the \u2013 of the reduction in interest expense. So about $0.04 in the first quarter from the being below par, and then $0.01 in the remainder of the year for interest. And Scott, anything to add to that?","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No, that's it. That's right on.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And can you talk about if you were to look at just the Integrys O&M in first quarter of 2015, and WEC \u2013 Legacy WEC O&M in that same period, and then combined, what was the O&M decline rate or O&M savings that you've realized so far year-to-date in 2016? And what do you \u2013 what's embedded in guidance?","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So, as we look at that in the O&M, and remember when you look at the O&M line, there's a lot more than just the O&M that's in the \u2013 what I would say, into the operations, there is O&M as it relates to regulatory amortizations, O&M that's related to the different riders. So, overall when we look at the O&M, we did have the savings that we had forecasted in with our \u2013 with the acquisition. When you look at \u2013 break back the different pieces, I would say on Wisconsin Electric, the O&M was up just a tad as it relates to a couple of storms we had in the area, and we accelerate a little bit of our forestry program because of the mild temperatures. We haven't specifically said what our O&M guidance is in the acquisition savings but overall when you look at it, it's probably O&M when you factored all the different stuff about 2% to 3% less than if you look at the combined adding up the simple O&M from the prior companies...","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And do you think you are in the early innings of realizing O&M savings or do you think you're at a pretty good run rate, meaning, do you still think, you have significant opportunity to takeout significantly more cost around the consolidated system from here?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, I guess, you used the baseball analogy. So, I'd say we are probably in the third inning, and I think there is a fair amount of additional work that we can do.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you Allen, much appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hi. How you doing?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'm good. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","All right. Just on the rate freeze letter that came out last week, what \u2013 how was that triggered? I mean, was that just basically \u2013 was this related to the merger or what sort of triggered the \u2013 I guess, it seemed like maybe the staff, it wasn't clear to me the letter, what actually was causing the review by the staff?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, typically the cycle in Wisconsin every two years, of course you do a case for the next \u2013 for the next year, and then known and significant (33:24) for the year after that. So this was our year typically to bring the companies in, and we've had \u2013 we had discussions with the staff. And we said look, we believe because of the benefits we're seeing from the merger that we're just going to freeze rates. And if we have increased cost in other areas, we're going to offset that with the benefits of the merge and we're just going to freeze base rates. So the \u2013 basically the avenue for the discussions was this very regular cycle to file rate cases. And so, we work through that avenue and talk with the staff and it's something that they were agreeable. And it's kind of interesting, Paul, as a part of when we're doing the merger proceedings, many people talked about as a proposal doing a rate freeze. So, now we're actually seeing the base rate freeze for 2017 in Wisconsin.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then there was, as I recall, some sort of accounting treatment that was part of it. Could you elaborate a little bit more this?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Sure, and let me sort of start and then I'll let Scott or Jim fill in any detail. So I think what you're referring to Paul is, at Wisconsin Public Service related to the ReACT project, and when Wisconsin Public Service went through their last rate case, so this was the rate case that was decided late last \u2013 late 2015 or 2016 rates. So they included in rates I believe at a $275 million level, the cost of the ReACT project. And so, we expect that the final cost of that project will be in a range of $335 million to $345 million. So, essentially what they would allow us to do with this accounting order is to differ in effect the impacts of the return off and on for that additional investment above $275 million. So, Scott..","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. That's correct. There's \u2013 I think as a total, there is three of them. The ReACT is the main one. The other two were some deferrals that specifically in the order they ended in December of 2016 and we said well, if we're going to be out for a year we just need the same accounting treatment in 2016 and in 2017, just to extend them into 2017.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay, great. And then, just finally \u2013 I'm sorry you were talking kind of quickly on the weather-adjusted sales. Did that include leap year? That wasn't clear to me. Or I mean, was it adjusted for leap year or...?","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah...","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Was leap year sort of left in there?","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. We factored out leap year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","So we adjusted as if \u2013 we adjusted it down as if leap year did not happen.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","So February 29 was out.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","It's factored out. Correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And that was minus 0.2% for retail sales in general, right?","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Excellent. Thanks so much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","How are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good. Thank you very much. I wanted to follow up a little bit on some of the first questions on the CapEx, perhaps just to kick it off. Can you elaborate a little bit on the next leg of the evaluation you kind of described by the EEI timeframe this fall you'll have the next round. What are the next layers of evaluation that you're looking at? Is there any kind of sense as to what genre of projects or at least magnitude of capital you could potentially be looking at in maybe these baseball analogies? How deep in terms of innings are you in terms of finding those acceleration opportunities?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Right. Well, you know as I mentioned earlier, about two-thirds of the impact is the bonus depreciation. So about two-thirds of the $1 billion is in 2016 and 2017. So, other than the second order effects associated with getting bonus depreciation on this additional property, I guess, we've identified $500 million of roughly $670 million. So I guess that's pretty late innings in terms of identifying offsets in 2016 and 2017. So I would say that Julien that the majority of our focus as we work through the rest of the year, up to when we have the November Finance Conference, the majority of our focus is going to be in the later years. And, Scott, I don't know if there is any other detail.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So, exactly the majority will be in the later years. We also are working on making sure we have all the resources and efficiently for 2017 spending, get everything lined up to put due to spending in. So, we will be working on those later years this summer.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And I think one thing Julien that maybe to give you a sense for how broadly we are looking, let's just take, for example, and this is not included in any of 2016 or 2017 numbers that we talked about, but one of the things we talked about a lot, although in Illinois and in Michigan, our gas utilities there actually own some gas storage, in Wisconsin, our gas utilities to my knowledge have never owned gas storage. They've always leased it. And, we think that it would make more sense to have a mix of owned storage as well as the leased storage. So I think that would be a nice opportunity \u2013 investment opportunity for the company. But we think it would also be beneficial for customers. So, we're trying to think broadly about what those capital opportunities might be, Julien. I hope that helps.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Absolutely. And does that also add into the decision to push out the rate case timing, recovery of the accelerated spend in 2016 and 2017 with the slightly delayed rate case. Is that kind of aligned with the thinking as well?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, it certainly contributes, but I think far and away the reason why we can freeze rates is because of the cost savings that we're seeing from the combination of the companies. But, you're right, I mean the accelerated depreciation impact acts as a bit of an uplift if you will also.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. Great. And actually just turning back to what you just alluded to there, how much in terms of lease expense or just if you can give us a sense of how much of that PPA needs potentially acquired via any Wisconsin Gas storage opportunities? I know it's early days there, but I figured I'd ask.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Julien, in all candor, it's just a little early for me to throw those numbers out.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","No worries at all. We can leave it there.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. As we know more, I mean, that's certainly something we can chat about either on the call or a future call or at EEI.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great. Thank you very much.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jim.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey, Allen. How are you?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","I am good. How about you?","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Pretty good. Switching topics, could we just talk about the transmission opportunities out there, specifically as it relates to Alaska? Are there any updates that we need to be aware of?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","No, Jim. There really aren't any updates at this point beyond what we talked about on our call, I guess, back in February. So nothing new there in terms of updates. Scott, anything you have to add on that?","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","I'm not aware of anything.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","No. Nothing.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I guess, the question is, is transmission opportunities in the state of Alaska a function of the price of oil and the Alaska fiscal health?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Well, in terms of the briefing that I received from Mike Rowe who is the CEO out at ATC, what he has told me is, basically if you look at the local economy, integrating the operations of the utilities is a benefit regardless of what the price of oil is, regardless of how low or how high. There is a benefit of integrating those utilities because they're certainly not integrated at all at the level that you would see in the continental United States. So there are big benefits with that regardless of the price of oil. And sort of, I guess, ironically, the low oil prices actually mean that the companies in Alaska might actually look a little more to ATC to provide the capital for the transmission projects. So I would say, worst case, the oil prices are sort of a neutral and although it sounds a little strange, the lower prices might actually mean that marginally ATC might be called on to make a bit more of the investment that's required.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. I appreciate the help. Thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Jim.","Operator","And your last question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Vedula.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","Hey, Allen. How are you? Congratulations, and nice to hear from you.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. No, I haven't talked to you in a long time. Glad you're doing well.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","Anyways, you touched on these things kind of around the edges, but when you came in 2003 and your mission was fairly clear. You had Power the Future that had been improved, but it simply was a matter of execution and getting that done and the non-regulated businesses that you had to cleanup. So the focus was fairly clear and that gave you \u2013 that was basically a runway of about eight years from, say, 2003 until 2010, 2011, whatever. So I'm wondering today \u2013 it's like we're sitting here in 2016. You have the merger done and you have the big pipeline replacement program in Illinois and everything like that. I'm wondering just if you can kind of give a sense of how much runway you think you have here. And just, even if it's not necessarily as large or as dramatic as what was sitting in front of you in 2003, can you just put it in context the way you're thinking about it going forward over the next few years?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Right. Well, I think as you look at -- of course, Power the Future, I guess, you could think of it, if you just looked at the new generation that was being built. I mean, that was sort of, as it turned out, a roughly seven to eight-year program. So, as you say, that's in the past. As we look at sort of what's coming up, we've got some programs like the AMRP program in Illinois, which we're probably looking at decades long. I mean, you're looking at programs that are ongoing for 20 to 25 years at least.","So we've got some programs that we think will be around a lot longer, even longer than Power the Future. We've got others that were kind of shorter in nature, and we talk some about the ERP project in Wisconsin. But I would say overall, Vedula, I mean, I think we easily have a runway of 10 or more years of capital investment that we think will benefit customers, in the case of Chicago, like a huge upgrade in safety. So I would say it's at least 10 years. But now it's really multiple programs in multiple states as opposed to being a single program and one and only in one state. I hope that helps.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","Yeah. No, just to clear also I think you've also touched on this in terms of you talked a lot about load growth and just conservation, efficiencies, and everything like that. When you look back to 2003 or whatever, I mean, we were still seeing fairly strong growth in terms of usage and everything like that. Going forward, that's not necessarily going to be the case. But I'm just \u2013 in terms of supporting kind of the ability to continue to grow whatever in terms of your earnings or whatever, I'm just wondering whether the things you referenced should be enough, even without any real net load growth. And also the one other thing I wanted to ask you is, in the past, you used to talk about having a couple hundred million dollars of free cash flow, net of CapEx and dividends. Can you just kind of refresh us in terms of where that kind of stands going forward as well?","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. And maybe, Scott, why don't you cover the cash flow question? But I would say, Vedula, I mean, clearly the situation with volume growth, be it electric or natural gas, it's going to be a bit of a headwind, which is why I think having the merger is beneficial to us, because we can generate some more cost savings to help deal with those headwinds. But Scott, why don't you give Vedula some background on the cash.","Scott J. Lauber - Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. In looking at our cash and remember we said in our prepared remarks and just lately, we said in our prepared remarks, we are not issuing any equity. Part of the acquisition reasons were to invest in good utility projects. So we are investing in utility projects that are very needed for the infrastructure. When you look at 2016 and 2017, we are not cash flow positive, but we also look at our consolidated debt to capital ratio and our consolidated holding company debt. And the holding company debt as a percent of total debt is about 28%, consistent with our projections, and we see that continuing to be there. So we are not cash flow positive, but we are not issuing any equity, and that's for the 2016 and 2017 timeframe, and we'll look at our projections as we go forward as we look at our capital plans in the future.","Vedula Murti - CDP Capital US, Inc.","Thank you very much.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","Thanks, Vedula.","Allen L. Leverett - President and Chief Executive Officer","All right. Well, that concludes our conference call today.

And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale E. Klappa","Elaine, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us as we review the company's 2012 year-end results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive of We Generation; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber our Assistant Treasurer. Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings from continuing operations of $2.35 a share for 2012. This compares with earnings from continuing operations of $2.18 a share for 2011. And I'm pleased to report that by virtually every meaningful measure, 2012 was an exceptional year for Wisconsin Energy. From an operations standpoint, we achieved milestones in customer satisfaction, employee safety and network reliability. In fact, we attained our highest customer satisfaction ratings in the past decade, and likely, the best ever. We also achieved the best safety record in the history of the company, and we were named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the eighth time in the past 11 years. I'm also pleased that we were able to dispatch only 1\/3 of our employee and contract crews to the New York City area to help restore power in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. We were honored to receive an Edison Electric Institute Emergency Assistance Award in recognition of our response. From a financial standpoint, we delivered solid earnings growth, generated strong cash flow and made significant progress toward a dividend payout that is more competitive with our peers. A number of factors contributed to our record financial performance in 2012. The weather, of course, had a major influence on our results. We began 2012 with the warmest winter in 122 years that was followed by an old-fashioned Midwest summer heatwave. In fact, 2012 was the warmest year on record in our region, breaking a mark that stood since 1931. In addition to the weather, the $1.3 billion we invested on state-of-the-art air-quality controls at our older Oak Creek units and in the new Glacier Hills Wind Park also contributed significantly to our 2012 earnings. Turning now to the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate at 6.6% as of December remains well below the national average. And although energy sales to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines, dropped by 0.7% in 2012, this was actually slightly better than our expectations. Our plan for the year projected a decline in sales in our large commercial and industrial group because 2 customers began using their own self-generation. Excluding these 2 customers and the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial sales actually rose by 1.1% for the year. We continued, during 2012, to see strength in several industry sectors including food products, chemical manufacturing, metal fabrication and plastics. An encouraging uptick in new customer connections also continued through the year. New electric service installations were up 8.7% compared to 2011, and connections of new natural gas customers increased by more than 13.2% over the prior year. Now as many of you may know, we have one major construction project well underway. That's our biomass fuel power plant in Rothschild, Wisconsin. At this point, construction is 65% complete. We're on schedule and on budget for commercial operation by the end of 2013. We expect the main boiler erection to be completed in the first quarter of this year. Steam turbine and generator have been anchored and grounded in place. Piping and electrical installation continues throughout the site. The switch areas have been energized and connected to the distribution network. The natural gas metering station is now complete and gas is available on the site. And construction of the truck dumpers and the fuel handling systems are well underway. As I've noted before, the biomass plant will help us diversify our portfolio of renewable assets. We'll be able to dispatch this unit and the efficient technology that will produce electricity for the grid and steam for the operating paper mill on the site will clearly enhance the economics of the project. Our investment in the biomass plant is expected to total between $245 million and $255 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction. Of course, the biomass project and the Glacier Hills Wind Park that we brought into service a year ago are key components that will help us meet Wisconsin's Renewable Portfolio Standard for the year 2015. To refresh your memory, the standard calls for an increase in the amount of electricity delivered from renewable sources from 5% in 2010 to 20% in 2015 at a statewide level. The standard sets targets for each Wisconsin utility using a historical baseline. Applying that baseline, approximately 8.25% of our retail electricity sales must come from renewable sources in 2015. We will be well positioned to meet that 2015 standard when we complete the biomass facility. Also, we recently signed agreements for some additional renewable energy credits. Those agreements should allow us to be in compliance with the standard through 2019. And because of favorable market conditions, we plan to purchase more renewable credits, further extending the timeframe that we expect to be in compliance. One final note on renewables, in early December, the Wisconsin Commission approved our purchase of the Mumford wind farm, the transaction we announced last August when we agreed with NextEra Energy Resources to purchase the 30-megawatt wind farm for $27 million. We previously had a power purchase agreement for 85% of the energy from this site, so the transaction did not change our renewable portfolio but it did increase our asset base. The remaining 15% of the output from this wind farm is under a power purchase agreement with another utility that runs through 2021. Turning now to other items of interest. In past quarters, we've discussed the impact on our operations of the coal and natural gas markets. Natural gas prices, of course, have remained at very low levels, influencing the dispatch order and locational marginal pricing in the Midwest power market. Over the years, the key to serving customers at a competitive price has been fuel diversity. And fuel diversity was a core principle of our Power the Future plan. You may remember that our plan called for the addition of 2,200 megawatts of new capacity, capacity that is almost equally balanced between coal and natural gas. So now, with our efficient new capacity in place and natural gas prices at low levels, our natural gas burn in 2012 nearly doubled from 23.9 billion cubic feet in 2011 to 46.5 billion cubic feet in 2012. In fact, our natural gas units at Port Washington operated at a 46% capacity factor for the year 2012. This compares with a 23% capacity factor in 2011. All 4 of the combustion turbines at Port Washington were fired for more than 5,200 hours in 2012, and that, of course, supported a record amount of generation from this site for the year. At times, our Port Washington units were essentially being dispatched as baseload units in MISO. Of course, as our natural gas burns have gone up, our coal burns have naturally come down. We burned approximately 8.3 million tons of coal in 2012 versus 10.7 million tons in 2011. We achieved this reduction by purchasing less coal, maximizing the use of coal storage and working with our coal suppliers to amend existing contracts. In another development, we're seeking a revised air permit that would allow us to blend western and eastern coals at our new Oak Creek expansion units. These units initially were permitted to burn eastern bituminous coal. However, moving to a blend with Powder River Basin sub-bituminous coal could significantly, in our estimates, lower fuel cost for our customers. Overall, our diverse fleet and our long-term power purchase agreement for nuclear energy position us, we believe, very well as the power markets continue to evolve. Now, I'll briefly turn to the final results of our Wisconsin rate case. If you remember that in the spring of last year, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission for electric natural gas and steam rates for the years 2013 and 2014. Our request was driven primarily by the investment of approximately $1.6 billion in previously approved capital projects, such as the air quality control system at our older Oak Creek units, the addition of the Glacier Hills Wind Park and the construction of our biomass plant in Northern Wisconsin. The commission completed its assessment in late November and issued a final order on December 20 for rates that went into effect on January 1 of this year. Here are the final results. The commission granted an overall 4.8% increase in base electric rates for 2013 and a 1% increase for 2014. After applying a renewable energy tax grant, and we'll talk more a little bit later about that renewable energy tax grant, but after applying that grant, that we expect to receive after our biomass plant is complete, our customers will see a net bill increase of 2.6% in both 2013 and 2014. In the rate order, the commission also determined that 100% of the construction costs for our Oak Creek expansion units were prudently incurred, and the commission approved the recovery in rates of more than 99.5% of the final cost at Oak Creek. Finally, the commission approved recovery of a 1.6% increase in fuel costs that we expect to see during 2013. For our natural gas distribution business, the commission granted our request for a decrease in natural gas rates for 2013, averaging 1.9% for gas customers of Wisconsin Electric and 5.5% for gas customers of Wisconsin Gas. Those rates will then remain unchanged in 2014. For steam customers, the commission authorized a 6% increase in 2013 and '14 for the Milwaukee downtown utility, and increases of 7% in 2013 and 6% in 2014 for our Wauwatosa steam utility. The commission also maintained our approved capital structures and return on equity. Switching gears now, you'll recall that in 2011, our Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase plan that calls for us to buy back up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions. The authorization runs through the end of 2013. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we repurchased approximately 1,028,000 shares at a cost of $37.8 million. Since the program began, we've repurchased approximately 4,650,000 shares at a cost of $151.8 million. That equates to an average purchase price for the program so far of                             $32.63 a share. And as we look at our dividend policy, earlier this month, our board affirmed our policy that targets a 60% payout ratio in 2014. The board also adopted a follow-on policy targeting a dividend payout ratio that trends to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017. This policy marks an important step toward making our dividend payout more competitive with our peers across the utility industry. It should also support double-digit growth in the dividend in 2014, and 7% to 8% dividend growth in the years 2015 through 2017. And as we reported to you in mid-January, the board declared a quarterly dividend of $0.34 a share for the first quarter of this year, which equates to an annual dividend of $1.36 a share. This represents a 13.3% increase over the prior year and is consistent with the dividend policy I've just described. Finally, I'd like to discuss the investment opportunities we see going forward in our core business. Our capital budget, and these are new numbers, our capital budget calls for spending between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion over the 5-year period ending 2017. In this new 5-year budget, the nature of our capital investments continue to shift away from high-profile projects, such as our Power the Future units, renewable generation and large air quality controls. Instead, our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure, the building blocks of our delivery business, pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations. The primary risks, of course, associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory, construction, are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the megaprojects we've completed over the past decade. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as the most reliable utility in the Midwest. Over the past few quarters, we've also been updating you on our goal to identify a life extension option for the Presque Isle Power Plant in Marquette, Michigan, an option that would be economically beneficial for our customers. In late November, we signed a definitive agreement with Wolverine Power Cooperative that calls for Wolverine to acquire a minority interest in the plan by funding new state-of-the-art emission controls for the facility. The new controls are necessary to meet expected changes in air quality rules, while maintaining system reliability in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The joint venture, I should point out, will not reduce our rate base. We expect that it will reduce our operating costs. We plan to file for approvals from the Michigan and Wisconsin Commission in February, and hopefully, begin construction work in 2014. And as you'll also recall, we announced plans late last summer to convert the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The Valley Plant is a co-generation facility located along the Menomonee River in Milwaukee that generates electricity for the grid and produces steam to heat hundreds of downtown Milwaukee buildings. Our analysis shows that converting the fuel source for this plant will reduce our operating cost and enhance the environmental performance of the Valley units. We plan to file an application with the Wisconsin Commission in the second quarter of this year for approval to modify the plant to use natural gas in the future. The electric capacity of the plant is expected to remain at 280 megawatts. If approved, we'll target completion of the project by late 2015 or early 2016. The current cost estimate, $60 million to $65 million. In addition, we're upgrading the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. The Wisconsin Commission approved this $26 million investment last June, and we expect to begin construction of the modern pipeline in the first quarter of this year. We believe the plan we put in place will secure Valley's role in meeting the energy needs of a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come. On another important topic, we're continuing to investigate the need for additional capacity for our natural gas distribution network in the Western part of Wisconsin. Now, for you cheesehead aficionados, we're evaluating routes to serve the communities between the town of Wilson in Eau Claire County and the City of Tomah in Monroe County. This region will need additional capacity to address reliability and to meet growing demand for natural gas. We plan to seek approval from the Wisconsin Commission on this project this spring. Our projected investment in the initial phase of the gas distribution project for West Central Wisconsin is approximately $150 million. So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, we enter 2013 in excellent condition, financially and operationally. The company is performing at a high level. All of our Power the Future investments are providing tangible benefits for our customers and stockholders, and we have much more to do to renew and upgrade our distribution network as we focus on delivering the future. Now, with more details on our full year performance for 2012, and importantly, our outlook for 2013, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, for 2012, our earnings from continuing operations rose to $2.35 a share. This compared with $2.18 a share for 2011. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2012 was right at $1 billion and is compared to $887 million in 2011. That's an increase of $113 million. The largest increase was in our utility segment. But we also saw an increase in our nonutility segment, which consists primarily of our Power the Future units. As we look at our utility operating income in 2012 as compared to 2011, you will see that operating income totaled $648 million for 2012, an increase of $103 million from 2011. As we discussed in our quarterly calls, the biggest driver in utility operating income was the impact of a 2011 rate agreement with our Wisconsin regulators. As background, going into 2012, we knew we needed a return on $1.3 billion of new plant that was being place into service with the Glacier Hills Wind Park and the air quality control system at our older Oak Creek units. Our agreement with the Wisconsin Commission froze base electric rates for customers in 2012, and it allowed us to recover depreciation expense and earn a return on the $1.3 billion of investment by suspending $148 million of regulatory amortizations that were part of our O&M expense. Our 2012 utility operating income, therefore, was favorably impacted by this $148 million amortization holiday. In addition, we estimate that the hot 2012 weather boosted our electric margins by approximately $19 million. Other factors, including lower fuel expense and lower O&M expense in our gas distribution business, accounted for the other $9 million of improvement. Partially offsetting these items was higher depreciation expense of $39 million, which primarily related to the $1.3 billion of new investments we discussed earlier. We also saw $34 million of lower gas margins primarily because of unseasonally warm winter weather in the first quarter of 2012. Now, turning to the non-utility energy segment, we saw operating income increase by $10 million in 2012 as compared to the prior year. As we mentioned during previous calls, we finalized the depreciable lives of the Oak Creek expansion units in 2012, which had a slight positive impact on earnings. We also had a full-year of earnings at the second Oak Creek expansion unit in 2012, which contributed to the increase in operating income. Taking the changes for these 2 segments together, we arrived at the $113 million increase in operating income for 2012. Corporate expenses and other miscellaneous items were flat year-over-year growth. During 2012, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company pooled nearly $66 million, up almost $3 million from 2011. Other income decreased by $28 million primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC allows us to accrue a return on approved utility projects during construction. In 2012, our AFUDC was down by almost $24 million because, as expected, we stopped accruing a return for the Oak Creek air quality control system and Glacier Hills when those facilities were placed into service. Net interest expense increased by $12 million primarily because of lower capitalized interest. We, of course, stopped capitalizing interest when the 2 large construction projects were placed into service. Consolidated income tax expense rose by approximately $43 million because of higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. The higher effective tax rate was driven primarily by lower equity AFUDC, which is a permanent difference for income tax purposes. Our effective tax rate for 2012 was 35.9% compared to 34% in 2011. We estimate that our effective tax rate in 2013 will be 37% to 38%. Combining all of these items brings you to $546 million of net income for continuing operations for the full year 2012 or earnings of $2.35 per share. During 2012, we generated $1.2 billion of cash from operations on an adjusted basis, which includes changes in restricted cash. This is up over $261 million over 2011. Our cash from operations was helped by $20 million of higher net income, $35 million of higher depreciation expense, $184 million of lower net working capital and lower contributions to our pension and other benefit trust. In 2012, we contributed $100 million to our pension and other benefit trust compared to $277 million in 2011. Partially offsetting all these items was $148 million reduction in noncash amortizations compared to 2011. This change was driven by the terms of the 1-year rate increase. Our capital expenditures totaled $707 million in 2012, $124 million decrease as compared to 2011. We saw lower capital expenditures as our large construction projects were completed. We also paid $276 million in common dividends in 2012, which was $34 million greater than 2011. Dividends for the year equated to an annual rate of $1.20 per share, which was a 15% increase over the prior year's annual dividend of $1.04 per share. And, as Gale mentioned, the board, just 2 weeks ago, declared an increase in the quarterly dividend equivalent to $1.36 per share on an annual basis or a 13.3% increase for 2013. As of the end of 2012, our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 53.2%. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentation. We expect 2013 ratios to be in line with 2012. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares. Turning now to our sales results. As shown in the earnings package on our website, retail sales of electricity decreased by 0.6% during 2012 as compared to the full year 2011. Our weather normalized sales were down by 1.5%. In our plan for 2012, we took into account an extended outage at our largest customer, and we knew that 2 other customers were moving to self-generation. Adjusting for these items, normalized retail sales declined by 0.2% for 2012 as compared to 2011. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw actual residential sales increase by 0.5% in 2012. On a normalized basis, residential sales declined by 1%. However, we believe the extreme weather conditions in 2012, including the warmest winter on record, and a hot dry summer compared to 2011, did impact the accuracy of our normalized results. Across our small commercial and industrial group, actual yearly sales rose by 0.7%. On a weather normalized basis, full-year sales to this group were up 0.3%. We continue to see modest growth in our small commercial and industrial class. Large commercial and industrial segment sales for the full year 2012 were down 2.8%. However, if you exclude the iron ore mines and the 2 self-generation customers, sales increased by 1.1%. Overall in 2013, we are projecting a decrease in weather-normalized sales of 0.7%, but that number does not tell the whole story. If we exclude the forecasted sales to the mines, we're projecting a slight increase of 0.2% for the year. We expect residential sales to remain relatively flat, impacted by modest growth in housing starts, offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting a slight increase of 0.3%. In the large commercial and industrial group, we are projecting a decrease of 2.4%. When you exclude the mines, we're projecting a slight increase in the large commercial and industrial group of 0.2%. Turning now to other items of interest. In December of 2012, our electric subsidiary issued a $250 million, 30-year bond at a coupon of 3.65%. This is the lowest 30-year coupon in our debt portfolio and one of the lowest on record. On a separate topic, as you know, the recent budget agreement in Washington extended bonus depreciation through 2013. Taken in isolation, you would expect to see a nearly $100 million reduction in rate base in 2015, which will carry through to 2016 as a result of this extension. However, as our new 5-year capital spending plan evolved, we saw the need to invest approximately $100 million more than our earlier internal projections. We took this impact into account when we finalized our capital budget of $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period of 2013 to 2017. Finally, I'd like to announce our earnings guidance. We expect our earnings for 2013 to be in the range of $2.38 a share to $2.48 a share. Our 2013 earnings projection assumes normal weather and reflects the new rates authorized by the Wisconsin Commission. Again, our guidance for 2013 is $2.38 a share to $2.48 a share. Now, before I talk specifically about our first quarter earnings guidance, I would like to touch on the accounting impact of the renewable tax grant associated with our new biomass plant. As Gale previously mentioned, our rates that went into effect January 1, 2013, reflect a bill credit for the expected benefit of the renewable grant. However, the accounting rules will not allow us to record the grant income until the plant is placed into service, which is expected in the fourth quarter this year. As a result, our revenues will be lower each quarter of 2013 until the plant is completed. When the plant is completed, we expect to record the grant income equal to the amount of the bill credits that were granted to date. We therefore expect this grant accounting treatment to reduce earnings in the first 3 quarters with a catch-up in the fourth quarter when the plant is scheduled to go online. Once the plan is commercial, you're allowed to match the grant income with the bill credits through December of 2014. With that as a backdrop, we expect our first quarter 2013 earnings to be in the range of $0.67 to $0.71 per share. The timing of this renewable grant is expected to reduce the first quarter earnings by approximately $0.03 per share. In addition, relative to 2012, our first quarter earnings are expected to be lower by approximately $0.04 per share due to lower AFUDC. With that, I will turn things to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa","Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with UBS.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","A question for you, actually 2 questions. One is a minutia question and one's a big picture. First, on the minutia. Did you say you expect to complete the buyback program this year? And then the second is really the big picture one. And so in light of the board's second approved dividend policy in less than a year, I mean a major revision, the question is how do you think about the balance between earnings growth and dividend growth over the longer term? So I guess said differently, how do you view your value proposition and differentiate yourself prospectively?","Gale E. Klappa","Okay, very good questions, Jim. On the minutia question, the answer is no, I did not say we would complete the buyback program in 2013. I did say the board had authorized the program to run through 2013. But as you know, we're being opportunistic.","There is no definite timeframe where the board has said we must finish the program for 2013. We will take a look each opportunity we have and go from there. And on the larger question, actually, I think there are 3 pieces to the answer. And the first piece, basically, I heard you asked how do we expect to differentiate ourselves as a quality investment going forward. And I really think it starts with the fact that we have today, we're in a fortunate position that we have greater financial flexibility today than certainly any time in the recent history of this company. And I think we have greater financial flexibility than virtually any other company in the industry. You'll see when we release our new investor deck tomorrow that we're projecting to have over $500 million of free cash flow in the period through 2017. We have, I think, so, number one, terrific financial flexibility. The second piece is even post Power the Future, we have significant growth. The growth is different, as I pointed out in the script, but we have significant growth that is needed in terms of the upgrade and the renewal of our distribution networks. So we're projecting 4% to 6% annual earnings-per-share growth, and given the financial flexibility we have, we think we have best-in-class dividend growth story. So when you put that altogether, I can see us delivering and believe we can deliver 8% to 10% total shareholder returns. And when your risk-adjust that for the type of projects that we have in front of us and the demonstrated ability of the management to deliver projects on time and on budget, I personally think that, that equates to a superior return story.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Can I just follow up with one question or two?","Gale E. Klappa","Sure.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","On the dividend policy, when the board talks about dividend policy and upping the payout ratio, how do you balance what that rate payout policy is supposed to be? So if we're entering an environment where utility growth is slower prospectively because in a 5% to 6% rate base growth environment, and underlying demand of 0% to 1%, it's going to be pretty tough to match that going forward. How do you think about modulating between dividends and the other considerations?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I think essentially -- again, a very good question, Jim. Essentially, what we do, and I think many do this, we step back and say what is legitimate capital spending need this business has. And we've identified that, for example, going forward in our new 5-year plan at $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion, okay? So how do we finance the $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion? In our case, that can be done with internally generated cash and also keeping our debt to total capital where it needs to be. So then, once you've identified that, what does your dividend policy evolve to from that situation, because in our case, we don't believe we need to issue additional equity. So in essence, we piece the puzzle together, starting with what is our growth opportunity, what is the investment need in the business, how do we finance that and then what can we do to stay at the efficient frontier for a company like ours on dividend policy.","James D. von Riesemann - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. And then I have one last one and I'll let it -- turn it over. But on going back to my final minutia question, your earnings guidance for 2013, does that assume some level of buyback for the balance of the year?","Gale E. Klappa","It does assume some level of buyback for the balance of the year, that is correct.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","So can you give us an update on where the debate in the Statehouse stands on the government potentially deciding to divest its state-owned power plants given their inability to find the funds to upgrade the emissions controls, and whether or not you might be in a position to help the government meet its emission controls and generation needs?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, we're not from the government, but we are here to help you, Greg. The truth of the matter is I think we will know a great deal more by July. The legislature now in Wisconsin is just back into session and the governor will be presenting his new biannual budget to the legislature sometime in the next few weeks. So there are a couple of different opportunities if a bill to authorize the sale of state power plants and other state assets, if that -- a bill like that is to move forward, there are a number of opportunities certainly in the first half of this year. So I believe we'll have much a clearer view of whether a sale of the state-owned  power plants is imminent by the time the budget passes in July.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","But the capital budget that you just laid out for us, since it's not at this point clear that there'll be an opportunity for you there, that would be accretive to that budget if that came about?","Gale E. Klappa","You are correct, that would be accretive to that budget.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","You mentioned sales growth in your '13 guidance, and I was just curious if you could just comment on O&M expense trends?","Gale E. Klappa","Sure, I'd be happy to. Now, one of the things that you will see and that may confuse some folks, as you look at our O&M reports over the next 4 quarters, just remember, we had an amortization holiday under our previous rate order that, in essence, put up on our balance sheet or kept on our balance sheet a $148 million of regulatory assets that did not amortize through O&M in 2012. That stopped as of January 1 of this year. So you're going to see $148 million increase in essence in O&M over the course of 2013 compared to 2012, but that's because of the regulatory amortization holiday ending. Essentially, there will be a very modest other increase in normal O&M. There'll be some increase related to some of the capital projects that we have on the distribution side of the business, are 80%  capital, 20% O&M under the rate formulas. So you may see some very modest increase in overall O&M, but day-to-day O&M other than that associated with supporting capital projects will be flat.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then also, I think in the previous calls, you mentioned some gas infrastructure growth in some of the regions where there's attractive sand for frac-ing.","Gale E. Klappa","That is correct.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Is that associated with the gas distribution investment of over $100 million you referenced earlier?","Gale E. Klappa","Yes. The $150 million project that we said, roughly $150 million capital project for western Wisconsin that I mentioned earlier in the call is directly associated with a major project for that part of the state. And it's related to 2 things. One, yes, we're seeing substantial increase in frac sand mining, but we also have customer growth there as customers convert from propane. So our projections are showing a dwindling amount of reserve capacity in the western part of the state. So we think there's a very solid and important case to make to the Public Service Commission for construction authority for that project, and we'll be making that case this year.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And lastly, on the potential state divestitures, can you remind us? I know there are small -- there are several small units. I'm just curious if -- I'd like to kind of gauge what type of investment size this could potentially lead to.","Gale E. Klappa","Well, we'd be happy to do that. First of all, there are -- and we're not certain if the state would put all of these plants up for bid or just some of them. All of that is yet to be determined. But if all of them were put up for sale, there are 37 of them, 3 or 4 are reasonable size. 3 or 4 are actually power plants that produce electricity for the grid and steam for a particular type of state customer. The remainder other than those 3 or 4, which are of reasonable size, the remainder are smaller steam plants that produce steam heat for specific state facilities. For example, the University of Wisconsin Milwaukee has a relatively new steam heat plant. It doesn't produce electricity for the grid but does produce district heat for a particular part of that campus. In terms of investment opportunity, we have a placeholder. We have not been allowed, no one has been because this hasn't been finally decided by the state. No one has been able to really do any due diligence on a particular project for these 37 different facilities. There's a state --as just a placeholder, we're thinking $200 million to $250 million.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And just reasonable size, what is that, 25 to 50 megawatts per unit?","Gale E. Klappa","Some of them are even smaller.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","You guys went through, and I apologize for being slow on the projected sales growth, I think for 2013, with or without the mines and stuff, could you -- I apologize. Could you redo those for me?","Gale E. Klappa","We will be happy to ask Pat to redo those for you.","James Patrick Keyes","Sure, I'll be glad to. So we projected overall, a decrease in weather normalized sales of 0.7%. However, if you exclude the mines, it's really an increase of 0.2%.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And this is retail, right?","James Patrick Keyes","Yes. And then if you flip quickly through the segments. Residential is basically flat. Small C&I, a slight increase of 0.3% and then large C&I, we projected a decrease of 2.4%. But if you exclude the mines, again, the large C&I is actually going to be an increase of 0.2%.","Gale E. Klappa","Other way to look at that is weather normalized, basically, we're expecting to hit the earnings targets we've given you with essentially no sales growth. 0.2%, weather-normalized, excluding the mines.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Does this take into account leap year?","Gale E. Klappa","Leap year, yes.","James Patrick Keyes","Yes, it does. Oh, yes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So leap year, obviously -- okay. So that basically is -- that's been normalized for that, correct?","Gale E. Klappa","It's been normalized for leap year. Were you in our forecast meeting?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","No, I'm afraid not. I hope you benefited from my absence. But I guess I wanted to get your thoughts. I mean 2\/10 of -- this is not exactly blockbuster growth. Just your thoughts about going forward, just policies for energy efficiency, renewables, what have you. I mean just sort of trying to get a sense as to how -- is there -- what do you think longer-term here or things that are driving this and how, as you guys are obviously very forward thinking, what have you, how do you position yourselves in terms of dealing with what appears to be, let's face it, not exactly superb growth? I mean, is that just an abnormality for this year or how do you look going forward longer-term?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, very good question. And I think, as you know, this is a question that is really beginning to be asked all over the industry. The first thing I would say is lots of companies will give you earnings growth projections and then when you dig deeper and say, well, what's behind that in terms of sales growth, 1%, 2% or 3%, we have never based our earnings growth projections on what we think are anything but appropriately conservative and rational sales ACs, but input from our customers. So let me take it segment by segment because I think there's a different story to answer your question in each one of the 3 segments.","First, the large industrial, strictly tied to the economy. We -- if you normalize our 2012 numbers, I think we were up 1.1% in industrial, nothing to write home about but -- I mean just intuitively to me, given what we're seeing in the economy in Wisconsin, that felt about right.","Commercial, we are up weather-normalized. It seems to me like we're seeing modest but continuing, predictable growth in the commercial segment of our customer group. The real puzzling one is residential. And there, I have a theory and I could be wrong. But it does not make a lot of sense to me when I see our weather-normalized residential sales. And I was talking with Scott Lauber the other day and he was saying, we had to weather-normalize 4% of our sales, closer to 5% of our sales, just because of the abnormal weather in 2011 and 2012. That's a huge number of megawatt hours. And we were 4, 5 standard -- well, 3 or 4 standard deviations away from norm in terms of the weather over the last couple of years. So my view is that we really need another year to update on residential before we really understand what's happening in terms of residential customer demand. I just am not seeing, and I don't think any of us are seeing, a major change in lifestyle in terms of our residential customers. We are seeing a change in the appliances and tools that are available to our customers to live their lifestyles. They're getting more efficient support from appliances, from TVs and everything else. But I still think our residential growth is underlying stronger than the numbers are showing because at this kind of deviation from norm, the weather normalization techniques just are not that accurate. So we really -- we're cautious. We're not going to promise you sales growth that we can't deliver. And I think the key going forward, if we don't see a rebound in growth, particularly in residential, the key going forward is going to be cost discipline. We have to continue to drive cost and productivity in our business. I hope that helps, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","It does. But then, I guess it's too early for any rate design or any thoughts about sort of a different construct with regulators or what have you, or it's just too early to say? Is that how we should think about it?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, actually, I mean we have a construct with our regulators in Wisconsin that I think is quite beneficial to everyone, and that is the commission has asked each of the Wisconsin utilities to file a case every 2 years with a 2-year forward-looking test period. So to me, the 2-year forward-looking test period, taking into account reasonable assumptions of sales demand -- sales and demand growth really is among the best protection you can get anywhere.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I got you. So decoupling, it doesn't -- I mean, since you're coming in so frequently and since you have the forward-look, it sort of negates the potential need for decoupling or something like that?","Gale E. Klappa","That would certainly be my view.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","I wanted to make sure, first of all, capital spending. Do you see -- if I remember correctly, '13 was higher outlook than '14. Do you still see that or do you see capital spending more kind of like levelized if I just took $3.2 billion, $3.3 billion and divide it by the 5 years? That's the first question. The second is free cash flow. Can you repeat the comment you made about how much total free cash flow after dividends you expect over the next few years?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, first of all, and you will see this on our investor deck that we're going to release tomorrow, the new breakdown of the 5-year capital spend, I will give you 5 numbers. For 2013, we're estimating $656 million of capital; for 2014, $589 million; and for 2015, $741 million.","James Patrick Keyes","And that's at the utility, Michael.","Gale E. Klappa","Yes, that's at the utility, exactly. That's coming off of by comparison $697 million of the utility for 2012. And we have that further broken down of the slide in the investor deck, the generation, electric delivery, gas delivery, renewables, et cetera. So you'll see a pretty granular breakdown tomorrow. But those are the essential numbers going forward. And then your other question about cash flow. What we're showing in our projections is a little better than $500 million of free cash for the 5-year period 2013 through 2017 after capital spending and after our dividend policy that we've announced is implemented.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And does that include or exclude the buyback program you've authorized?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, that would include.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. So it's not incremental for the buyback? It is...","James Patrick Keyes","Michael, this is Pat. Let me clarify. The $500 million over the 5 years is before we start the buyback. So in other words, we would use the $500 million as cash to help fund the buyback.","Gale E. Klappa","Exactly, yes.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. Okay. It just strikes me as given some of the stuff you put out in the public domain regarding various tax-related items, that your free cash flow would actually even be a little bit above that level. Am I -- I may be overstating something, but it just -- the $500 million at first glance over the next 5 years strikes me as a little bit on the shy side. Not that, that's a problem. Most other companies don't have that problem.","James Patrick Keyes","Michael, we appreciate it. I guess the only thing I could say is you know how that cash was generated, certainly from operations, also from bonus depreciation. That bonus depreciation kind of falls off over time. If you're running like next year's model and you're saying, boy, you're sure generating a lot of that cash next year, that wouldn't surprise me if that's what your model said. Certainly, we expect more of the cash flow over the 5 years to be in the upfront years than in the back-end.","Gale E. Klappa","It's more front-end loaded.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And are there things, whether it's working capital, whether it's pension contributions or something else, that are significant cash outflows that may not show up -- that aren't necessarily net income D&A, CapEx, dividends, kind of the big 4?","Gale E. Klappa","No. In fact -- the short answer is no. But we've had very good control of our working capital over the course of the last several years. In addition to that, from a pension fund standpoint, we're almost 100% funded, which many companies cannot say. So we don't see anything else like that lurking that would show a deviation in the numbers.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Bischof with MorningStar.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","I was wondering if you could just provide a little clarity on the timing for decision regarding air permit application for the western, eastern coal blend in Oak Creek? And then clarify question, you said you were 100% funded for the pension funds?","Gale E. Klappa","99-point-something.","James Patrick Keyes","Yes, we're over 99, Andy.","Gale E. Klappa","And we'll ask Allen Leverett to comment on the timing for the air permit for the fuel blending at Oak Creek.","Allen L. Leverett","Yes, we expect to have that resolved in the first quarter of the year. So I certainly see it as being in the first part of this year. But we'll have to work with not only the U.S. EPA, but we're also working with the Wisconsin DNR. So we have to work with both agencies, get their concurrence and then the DNR is the one that will actually issue the permit. So we hope to have all of that wrapped up in the first quarter so that we can begin the testing, say, in the second quarter of this year.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Just your O&M commentary, so we should take 12, add 148 for the holiday and then gross that up by 1% or 2%? Is that fair?","Gale E. Klappa","I would -- actually, I don't think I'd even add 1% to 2%. I'd keep it flat.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","And can you just review the language around the grant and how that's impacting timing?","Gale E. Klappa","We sure can. I'll frame it and will let Pat fill in the detail. Essentially, in the Wisconsin Commission rate order, for rates that went into effect here in January of '13, we agreed -- in fact we proposed and the commission agreed that we would prefund, if you will, the grant. So customers are receiving, starting with their January bills, a portion of the federal tax grant that we expect to receive upon completion of the biomass plant. So in essence, because we're giving customer credits in advance of receiving the cash, our revenues are going to go down and they will have a slight impact each quarter for the first 3 quarters on earnings. And then we do a big catch-up according to the accounting rules in Q4. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes","Exactly, Gale. So I would look at it this way. If first quarter was a $0.03, you can expect to see something similar, same zip code, second quarter and third quarter, and then a $0.09 pickup in Q4 so it all comes clean.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc., Research Division","Is there a cost of money issue?","Gale E. Klappa","Oh, a minor one, yes. But, I mean, it's factored into the rate case.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Dan Jenkins","I was wondering, you mentioned -- update us a little bit on the CapEx program and apparently, there'll be more details tomorrow.","Gale E. Klappa","Correct.","Dan Jenkins","Do you have -- could you give us an update for what you're planning for financing needs in 2013?","Gale E. Klappa","Sure. Pat and Scott have that right in front of them.","James Patrick Keyes","Yes, glad to, Dan. We have got debt retiring, I believe it's in May at Wisconsin Electric of about $300 million. So you can expect us to be out for a bond over roughly that amount, roughly Q2, Q3. And then at Wisconsin Gas, we have got $45 million of debt retiring in Q4. I would expect we'll be doing a new issue of Q3, Q4 at Wisconsin Gas in the $100 million, $150 million neighborhood.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. Then I was also wondering, I'm trying to get a better idea of what's going on in the large commercial, industrial. You had fairly large decline mostly related to the mines and those 2 self-generation customers in 2012.","Gale E. Klappa","Correct.","Dan Jenkins","But then you mentioned in the release that the mine return to normal operation in September, but yet you expect a big decline again in 2013, mostly related to the mine. So, I guess, is the mine just becoming a lot smaller and smaller operation or what's going on?","Gale E. Klappa","No, I don't think the mine is becoming a much smaller and smaller operation, but they are -- they're very good about informing us of their plan in terms of when they see demand and how they expect to run their mine operations throughout the course of the year. And clearly, what we did when we put together our industrial forecast for 2014 was take the input from the mines on when they might, in essence, have a slowdown in their operations in 2013. So what you're seeing is basically the mines having more variable operation than perhaps the past couple of years.","Dan Jenkins","Right. It sounds like -- so how much of the 2.8% decline in '12 was related to the mine? Do you know that?","Gale E. Klappa","Looking at Scott. I would say the lion's share of it -- now, we did have 2 customers, but they were smaller in 2012 go to self-generation. But the lion's share of it, Scott, would be the mines.","Scott J. Lauber","Right. If you exclude the mines, they're relatively flat.","Gale E. Klappa","Yes, exactly. Just exclude the mines, relatively flat.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. So they're going to be even lower than they were though in '12 again? And so that's what I would...","Gale E. Klappa","No, no. I don't believe so.","Scott J. Lauber","Just a little bit lower in '12. They announced that they're going to idle the plant in the second and third quarter a little bit.","Gale E. Klappa","Yes, they're bringing their operations down some of the second and third quarters.","Scott J. Lauber","Extended summer outage.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then you mentioned that you're nearly fully funded on the pension. Will you need to make any more contributions in 2013 or will that...","Gale E. Klappa","None planned in 2013.","Dan Jenkins","Okay. And then if you could just expand a little bit on the fairly sizable benefit of '12 over '11 and the working capital. Is a lot of that related to the deferral?","Gale E. Klappa","Actually, no. The deferral -- it would not relate to deferral. Steve Dickson has the details in front of him. Steve?","Stephen P. Dickson","Yes, and I assume you're referring to the earnings package, and I'm looking at Page 11 and we've separately broken out the regulatory amortization. So you can see the $148 million change year-to-year. In the working capital and other, it declined. It was a negative $230 million last year, this year, it's a negative $56 million. So actually, that's a favorable improvement of about $174 million. The biggest item in there relates to income taxes that we got back, and it relates to the bonus depreciation that we talked and we were able to generate a net operating loss carry back. So we went back to where we've paid taxes in prior years. So there's $128 million and then the difference was $20 million in inventory, working capital. Gas prices are lower so we benefited from that. Does that make sense?","Dan Jenkins","Yes, yes.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And this may be one for Mr. Leverett. Just curious. You've given out for ATC, a 10-year capital spending projection. I think it was like $3.9 billion and above roughly. Can you just talk about the scope and scale, meaning is that very front-end loaded, is that very back-end loaded? I think if I remember correctly, ATC's CapEx had been around in the $250 million range or so for the last few years. Where is that heading in the next couple of years?","Allen L. Leverett","It's somewhat back-end loaded, Michael. And we sound like a broken record talking about this package that's coming out tomorrow, but in the package that comes out tomorrow, you'll see kind of a 3-year path for the capital spending at ATC. So in 2013, we expect the spending to be roughly $291 million and then $255 million in '14 and then it jumps. It's projected to jump to $362 million in 2015. So it's somewhat back-end loaded, and in fact, some of the really large projects that are in their forecast during the -- are out, say, in year 7, 8, 9 because those are projects that are associated with transmission fixes for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. So those are pretty far out in the forecast. So in general, pretty back-end loaded, and the package tomorrow will show you the year-by-year detail, at least for the next 3 years at ATC.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it, Allen. And just refresh, how does that compare to 2012 CapEx at ATC?","Allen L. Leverett","I want to say that the 2012 CapEx -- I thought it was around the $250 million number that you mentioned, actually, Michael, but let me get, Pat, maybe if you could check that number.","James Patrick Keyes","Well, it was $310 million. So a little over $300 million.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And your owner -- and am I right, your ownership percentage, mid-20 like 26%, 28%?","James Patrick Keyes","26.2%.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","And the same ROE and authorized equity layer metrics, no changes there?","Allen L. Leverett","Nothing has changed in their tariff. So it's still 12 to ROE, roughly 50% equity deemed capital structure.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul T.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made. In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the year. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, who is our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, our General Counsel; Bill Guc, our Controller; and finally Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Now, as you saw this morning, we reported full 2016 adjusted earnings per share of $2.97, ahead of our guidance range of $2.88 to $2.94. Our adjusted earnings exclude merger-related costs of $0.01 per share. Scott will provide a more detailed review in a moment. Now, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 5% to 7% off a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share.","Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, and this is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectations. In addition to our full-year results, we have two other positive developments to share with you today. On January 20, we signed an agreement to acquire Bluewater Gas Holding, which owns an underground natural gas storage facility in Michigan.","This facility can provide approximately one-third of the storage needs of our natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The total acquisition price is $230 million. Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of our three natural gas distribution companies in Wisconsin. The earnings from this investment are expected to be the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies.","We plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission in the coming days for a declaratory ruling. In this request, we will ask the Commission to confirm that is reasonable for our Wisconsin gas utilities to enter into these transactions. The service agreements were expected to provide for a utility return on capital. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful customer benefits. We chose the service agreement structure for two reasons.","First, we don't want to put the Wisconsin Commission in the position of being asked to approve an out-of-state acquisition by our Wisconsin distribution companies. Second, this avoids directly involving our state regulated companies in an interstate natural gas business.","The second positive development relates to our proposed generation solution in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. On Monday, we filed for required construction-related authorizations related to our generation plan there. This filing was made on behalf of the Upper Michigan Energy Resources Corporation or UMERC for short.","UMERC began operation on January 1 of this year, following its approval by the Michigan Commission. We are proposing a $275 million investment in about 180 megawatts of natural gas-fired reciprocating internal combustion engines. This will provide a reliable cost-effective long-term generation solution for our customers in the Upper Peninsula including the mine owned by Cliffs Resources.","We are targeting commercial operation in 2019. At that time or soon after, we expect to be in a position to retire our coal-fired Presque Isle Power Plant. This should give significant savings in operations and maintenance expenses as well as reduce carbon emissions.","Turning now to the regulatory front. Last year, we only had one rate case. Now, this case was actually filed in 2015 but was decided in 2016. We received a final decision from the Minnesota Commission in October for our natural gas LDC authorizing a 9.11% return on equity. The revenue increase was approximately 3% or an estimated $6.8 million in line with our expectation.","I also expect we will have another quite year on the rate case front. We do not plan to file a case in Illinois this year, and we'll know more about Wisconsin in the coming months. Our strong preference would be to keep rates flat while managing our costs and returning additional benefits to our customers through the earnings sharing mechanisms that we'll put in place at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas by the Wisconsin Commission after the Integrys acquisition. These mechanisms delivered $24 million of benefits to customers in 2016.","Turning to our ATC investment. On September 28, FERC affirmed a prior ALJ recommendation of a 10.32% base return on equity in response to the first MISO return on equity complaint. ATC qualifies for a 50 basis point adder for being a MISO member, thus increasing their return on equity to 10.82%, and we are currently recognizing income at this 10.82% level.","Although the recent commissioner resignation at FERC injects some additional uncertainty, we still expect an order by the end of June in the second MISO complaint case. In that case, the ALJ recommended a base return on equity of 9.7%. Again ATC qualifies for the 50 basis point adder, which would bring their return on equity to 10.2%. When the final order is received, we anticipating transitioning to the 10.2% return on equity. We factor this return into our long-term financial plan.","Now, a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annual dividend rate stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.","I would now like to provide you with an update on our five-year capital forecast. Our five-year plan now reflects $9.7 billion versus the last five-year plan, which was $9.2 billion. I would note that the $9.7 billion plan includes the natural gas storage as well as the UP generation investment that I just discussed. These figures do not include our share of projected capital investments at ATC, which is $1.4 billion for investments inside the traditional ATC footprint and approximately $300 million in projected capital outside the footprint.","We do have some news regarding ATC. On January 30, ATC announced that it had entered into a joint operating agreement with the Arizona Electric Power Cooperative. The partnership known as ATC Southwest will develop needed transmission projects in Arizona and the Southwest United States.","Finally, I'd like to take some time to address potential implications of tax reform. Both the Trump administration and the House Republicans have floated some tax reform ideas that could impact our business. Although the details have yet to be finalized, the current proposals have three common elements, reducing the corporate tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes, and eliminating interest expense of the deduction.","These elements would have different impacts on customers and shareholders, depending on whether we look at the utilities, We Power or the holding company. I would like to address these in conceptual terms first, and then summarize the potential impacts for shareholders. In addition, we have included a chart in the earnings packet that lays out the potential impacts to customers and shareholders for each segment.","First let's look at the regulated utilities because of the traditional rate-making approach, reducing the corporate tax rate directly benefits customers by lowering the provision for income taxes and rates. The lower tax rate also creates an excess deferred tax position that would benefit customers over time. From a shareholder perspective, this change would be neutral to slightly positive as the regulatory liability related to the reduction in deferred tax liabilities is amortized.","The second element, 100% expensing of capital, would reduce rate base in the short term. However, a lower tax rate would help to offset this impact. The third element, elimination of the interest tax deduction, would increase the cost of capital for customers. I view this as a large negative for customers. However, this would be neutral for shareholders.","So, We Power, the facility leases between We Power and We Energies would flow the benefit of the tax rate change through to customers. Any one-time excess deferred tax balance created would remain at We Power and benefit shareholders. 100% expensing of capital would have little impact because of We Power's low projected capital spending levels going forward.","The elimination of the interest expense deduction would be detrimental to We Power, if the change affects interest on existing debt. It is unknown if this change would affect only interest on new debt or all interest expenses. In addition, the House plan mentions taking into consideration an offset to interest income and the possibility of exempting banks or leasing entities.","From the shareholders' perspective, there are three key issues, the deductibility of interest, the impact on utility rate base, and deferred taxes at We Power. Deductibility of interest has the largest potential impact. If existing interest is not deductible, the estimated impact would be $0.14 per share at the holding company and $0.05 per share at We Power. However, if interest on existing debt is allowed to be deducted at a lower effective tax rate of 20%, the net effect would only be approximately $0.05 per share in total. Of less significance is the rate base effect at the utility level.","The cumulative effect of all these changes, 20% effective tax rate, 100% expensing of capital for tax purposes, and non-deductibility of interest would reduce rate base by approximately $300 million over a five-year period. On a positive note, with an assumed change in the deferred tax rate to 20%, we would expect the We Power deferred taxes to have a one-time reduction of approximately $270 million, which would reduce future tax payments.","Finally, both plans would reduce dividend and capital gains tax rates to the benefit of our shareholders. Although, this would not have an impact on the earnings of the company, it could potentially impact sector valuation. As I mentioned earlier, much of the details on this still need to be worked out by Congress and the new administration. Obviously, we will be paying very close attention to tax reform as it takes shape. But we wanted to share our current understanding of the implications of the plans that are now being discussed.","So now with details on our 2016 results and our financial outlook, here is Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Allen. In 2016, our GAAP earnings grew $2.96 per share from $2.34 per share in 2015. Our 2016 results include a full year's impact of the Integrys acquisition. Recall that 2015 results only include two quarters of Integrys earnings. Excluding acquisition costs, adjusted earnings per share increased $0.33 from $2.64 per share in 2015 to $2.97 per share in 2016.","For purposes of comparing 2016 and 2015 earnings on a consistent basis, the calculation of adjusted earnings per share for 2015 now includes Integrys earnings, all interest expense related to the acquisition financing, and all shares issued in conjunction with the acquisition. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.","For 2016 results, I'll first focus on adjusted operating income by segment and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Integrys results for the first two quarters of 2016 are separated for comparability purposes. Referring to page 11 of the earnings package, our consolidated operating income for 2016 adjusted for costs related to the acquisition of Integrys was $1.6856 billion as compared to $1.3581 billion in 2015, an increase of $327.5 million.","Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income totaled $1.027 billion for 2016, an increase of $128.6 million from 2015 adjusted operating income. We realized a $128.4 million contribution from the Wisconsin Public Service during the first two quarters of 2016, with remaining increase related to favorable weather, positive fuel recoveries and rate increases at Wisconsin Gas and Wisconsin Public Service, offset by an increase in operation and maintenance expense.","Operation and maintenance expense in 2016 included $24.4 million of expense related to the earnings sharing mechanism in place at Wisconsin Electric Power Company and Wisconsin Gas, which were effective January 1, 2016 and will last for three years. Under the earnings sharing mechanism, if either company earns above its authorized return, 50% of the first 50 basis points of additional utility earnings will be shared with customers, all earnings above the initial 50 basis points will benefit customers.","In 2016, our Illinois segment recognized operating income of $239.6 million, an increase of $160.2 million compared to the $79.4 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015. We recognized $159.6 million of operating income during the first two quarters of 2016, and the remaining increase was driven primarily by continued investment in the gas system modernization program. In 2016, our other states segment recognized operating income of $49.9 million, an increase of $43.8 million compared to the $6.1 million of adjusted operating income recognized during 2015.","We recognized $34.1 million during the first two quarters of 2016. The remaining $9.7 million increase was mainly due to the rate increases at Minnesota Energy Resource Corporation and Michigan Gas Utilities as well as comparatively colder weather in the fourth quarter of 2016.","Operating income at the We Power segment was up $2.2 million when compared to 2015. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plans. Our corporate and other segment realized an adjusted operating loss of $6.5 million in 2016, compared to the adjusted operating income of $800,000 in 2015.","Lower operating income was driven in part by $1.4 million loss recognized by the Integrys companies during the first two quarters of 2016. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrive at $327.5 million increase on adjusted operating income. During 2016, earning from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $146.5 million, an increase of $50.4 million from last year.","Integrys results for the first two quarters of 2016 drove $39.6 million of the increase, leaving a comparable year-over-year increase of $10.8 million. Lower equity earnings in 2015 were driven by an administrative law judge initial decision in December 2015, related to the ATC ROE reviews, which was later affirmed by FERC order in 2016.","Our other income net increased $21.9 million. The Integrys companies contributed $38.1 million of other income during the first two quarters of 2016. The offsetting $16.2 million decrease related to excise tax credits recognized by Integrys Transportation Fuels in the fourth quarter of 2015, and lower AFUDC primarily related to timing of the capital expenditures. As you recall, Integrys Transportation Fuels was sold in the first quarter of 2016.","Our net interest expense increased $71.3 million driven by $68.5 million of interest expense recognized by the Integrys during the first two quarters of 2016. The remaining $2.8 million increase was driven by interest on the $1.5 billion of debt issued in June 2015 to complete the acquisition. This was offset in part by the repurchase of a portion of the Integrys 6.11% Junior Notes in February 2016. Those notes were replaced with lower interest rate short-term debt.","Earnings from the Integrys companies during the first two quarters of 2016 drove the $108.7 million increase in our adjusted consolidated income tax expense. Looking forward, we expect our effective income tax rate to be between 37% and 38%. Combining all these items brings us to an adjusted earnings of $941.1 million or $2.97 per share for 2016, compared to $720.7 million or $2.64 per share for 2015.","Net cash provided by operating activities increased $809.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2016. This increase was primarily driven by $655 million of net cash flows from the operating activities of Integrys for the year ended December 31, 2016. The remaining increase was driven by a decrease in contributions to employee benefit plans. We contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust in 2015, and we did not make a contribution in 2016. In January 2017, we contributed $100 million to our qualified pension trust.","Our capital expenditures totaled $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2016, a $157.5 million increase compared to 2015. The largest increase was related to inclusion of a full-year of capital investments at the Integrys companies. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.9% at the end of December, a decrease from the 53.1% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year.","Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinated Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","We also paid $624.9 million in common dividends during the year ended December 31, 2016, an increase of a $169.5 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the increase in the shares outstanding related to the Integrys acquisition and an increase in the dividend rate compared to 2015.","Moving to sales. We see continued customer growth across our system. At the end of December, our Wisconsin utilities were serving about 7,000 more electric customers and 12,000 more natural gas customers compared to a year ago. Our natural gas utilities in Illinois, Michigan, and Minnesota were serving approximately 16,000 more customers compared to a year ago.","Now, let's discuss delivered sales volume year-over-year. For comparative purposes, 2015 electric sales information reflects results for both Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Public Service. Weather normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year. Retail electricity deliveries excluding the iron ore mines increased 2%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail deliveries of electricity increased 0.2% compared to 2015.","Looking at the individual customer segments, actual residential deliveries rose 4.1%, while weather-normalized residential deliveries increased 0.4%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, actual deliveries increased 2.3%, while weather-normalized deliveries increased 0.9%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2016 decreased 1.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries were flat year-over-year.","Now an update on our natural gas deliveries. As you may recall, our Illinois segment has a decoupling mechanism and its margins are less affected by weather. Looking at Wisconsin, our largest segment, retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation increased 1.6%. On a weather-normalized basis, retail gas deliveries excluding gas used for power generation were up 3.7% compared to 2015.","Overall, our normalized results for gas and electric sales in 2016 were slightly above our expectations. For 2017, we'll forecast and discuss delivered results for the State of Wisconsin, our largest segment. In Wisconsin, we're forecasting modest increase of 0.2% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mine.","Looking at 2017 by individual customer segment, we expect residential deliveries to decline 0.2%, impacted by continued modest growth in housing starts, but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to increase 0.5%. In the large commercial and industrial group excluding the mine, we are projecting an increase of 0.3%. We project 2017 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase 0.5%.","Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2017. As Allen mentions, we expect long-term earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 5% to 7% of a 2015 standalone Wisconsin Energy base of $2.72 per share. Our guidance for 2017 is in the range of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share. This is in line with our previously disclosed earnings per share growth expectation. This guidance assumes normal weather. Again, our guidance for 2017 is $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share.","Finally, let's look at the quarterly guidance. In the first quarter of 2016, we earned $1.09 per share. As you may recall, the first quarter of 2016 had warmer than normal weather, which was offset by fuel recoveries.","In addition, there was a $0.04 pickup in the first quarter as a result of the repurchase, a portion of the Integrys 6.11% Junior Notes. Taking these into account and a mild January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in the range of $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share, that assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter. Once again, first quarter guidance for WEC Energy Group is $1.02 per share to $1.06 per share.","With that, I will turn things back to Allen.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Operator, we are now ready for the question-and-answer portion of our conference call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Thank you. Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks, guys. Good afternoon.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Looking at 2017, looking at your margin walk, you had $38.9 million of margin in 2016 from weather, but then in excess of the earnings sharing mechanism, you also had a $33.4 million increase in O&M. So, as you think about 2017 in a normal weather scenario, should we be thinking about your ability to modulate O&M in order to still earn close to or at your targeted allowed return? And what are the factors that are sort of the puts and takes that get you into sort of a confidence range around a normal weather, meaning you can earn your authorized return?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. Good question, Greg. And I think maybe I'll just answer the question. It's kind of at a summary high level. The plan that we put together for 2017 would call for us to reduce O&M. So if you look at the 2016 run rate, the run rate in 2017 would be 3% below the level that it was at in 2016.","Now, in addition to that Greg, as we have always done in previous years, weather is obviously uncertain, could be better or worse than normal, so we certainly have levers if you will above and below that 3% level, so that we can adjust our operations as we see weather that's either favorable or unfavorable. But the base plan would call for a 3% reduction in the level of O&M.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks. What is the timeline for you engaging with the Public Service Commission and making a decision to either file for a general rate case this year, or decide mutually to defer that for another year?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, I think you're referring to the Wisconsin Commission, and we...","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yeah.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","...began engaging with their staff right after the holiday. So the first week of January, we started having discussions with them. In terms of a likely timetable, Greg, my view at this point would be, from traditionally if you're going to file a case, you're filing kind of the mid-to-late April, early May sort of timeframe. So, I think we certainly need to come to a resolution before, say, that mid-April timeframe. And I think we're on track to either be able to file a case although we don't think that's the best path or to let the mechanism that the Commission put in place continue to operate for at least another year.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. My last question is on, your last published slide deck is your January deck and you gave capital spending of 2020. If I start with 2017 averaging about $1.9 billion and then an incremental, your portion of ATC averaging, let's call it around $300 million over the similar timeframe, maybe a little less, the acquisition you're making of the storage fields, that is incremental to that plan or was that incorporated in that plan?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. The storage field will be incremental to that plan. And we'll have the new slide deck out shortly.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. So, if you would have added that $200 million into your plan and we're to presume that you're going to earn out your authorized returns across all the jurisdictions and all the investments you're making over this period, where inside the sort of 5% to 7% earnings growth aspiration would you expect to be at this juncture?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sure. And so, let me bridge back to the capital plan that I'd discussed kind of in the prepared remarks. So, if you take the $9.7 billion, what I would just call the more of the retail business, add the $1.4 billion for ATC inside the footprint and then, put on top of that the $300 million outside the footprint. Greg, I see that getting us kind of more of the low end of that 5% to 7% range. And then, what you'd need to do in order to kind of move up in that range, I'd say most likely would be to make some significant investment outside the footprint, the traditional footprint at ATC. But the capital plan that I described in the prepared remarks, very supportive of something kind of near that low end of the range.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Great. Thank you, guys. Have a great day.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon, guys.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","How are you?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Good. Thank you. Well, perhaps just a follow-up on Greg's question if you may. Can I ask \u2013 you alluded to ATC as being kind of another lever to get you higher up in that range? You also discussed on the call, if I heard right, a new JV effort. Is that something we should be paying attention to in terms of meaningful drivers in the ATC, is that an equation, or what would then ATC would be that prospect, or what geography are we talking about?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. I would say, well, short answer is yes, you should be paying attention, Julien, because I think that Arizona, there are certainly a lot of needs for transmission in Arizona. So, I would say though in terms of most likely places that ATC could do things outside the footprint, Arizona is one of them and then going into the California market, because they're going to be looking. They still have very aggressive renewable goals, and they're going to be looking to import effectively renewable power in the California. So, I think the largest potential opportunities outside footprint are in the West and more likely the North Arizona and California.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. That's great. So then, maybe just turning back to the latest acquisition if you will, can you elaborate a little bit further, one, on the specific acquisition you just did, where will that be accounted for if it's outside the utilities, that's just going to be at a holdco kind of figure? And then separately, just to clarify a typical equity ratio, typical ROE on the full 200 and change number that you're acquiring this far.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. I think your description was very good, Julien, but maybe just let me review it for everybody on the call. So, what we would do, Bluewater Holding would be a first here subsidiary of WEC Energy Group. We would capitalize at approximately 50% equity, 50% debt. The equity would come from the parent, and then we would issue debt sort of on balance sheet, if you will, non-recourse debt down at that subsidiary.","Equity return in the low 10%s is what you typically see right now for the Wisconsin utilities. So that's how we would structure it. And then you would have a collection of three service agreements back from Bluewater Holding, an agreement to each of the three Wisconsin LDCs.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And just to clarify, what's the tenure of the contract that we're talking about with between the new gas storage sub and your utilities? I know you guys want to make this utility like, so perhaps just emphasize...","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Sure.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","...for us what that profile looks like, what the tenure is, and to what degree have you mitigated the risks.","And then maybe let me throw it in while I got the mic here. The last question being, are there incremental opportunities either off of this existing asset that you're acquiring or further acquisition target both in Wisconsin or elsewhere that you would want to scale up this gas storage opportunities efficiently?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Okay. So, let me start with kind of the nature of the service agreements. So, when we'll lay this out in our declaratory ruling request, I mean literally in a matter of days, so we'll include in there the service agreements as we would propose them. In terms of tenure, Julien, we would actually propose 60-year agreements, so very long tenure agreements.","And effectively what the agreement would provide for is a return on and of capital that's been invested, including the initial investment, and then as you have O&M, which we expect you would have O&M of course and I think it'd be modest capital but if you had some additional capital that would be required at the field that would also be recovered kind of through that return of and on mechanism.","So, we'll lay all that out in the declaratory ruling and there will be attachments to that. The service agreements will be attached to that ruling request. Getting kind of to the second question that you ask, additional opportunities, I believe in terms of working gas, this field has like 23.2 bcf in terms of working gas, that's about a third of our requirements.","I do believe, you could do some additional expansion at the field and you could add some more working gas at the field. If you did that, that would be also covered by that service agreement, sort of structure that I mentioned. I think other than that for the Wisconsin utilities, there really aren't any other gas infrastructure things that we're looking at. So, hopefully...","(39:44)","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. So, it's not that big of an incremental opportunity on the gas storage side, not looking to fully cover your needs, shall we say beyond the...","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah, it only covers the third of the needs, so there certainly would be room to do a bit more own storage in the future because it's only a third.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Right. But at the site principally not necessarily incremental?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","That's right.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. Thank you for the time.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good afternoon, guys.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon.","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Thanks for the extra color on tax and the detail there. I'm wondering can you \u2013 should we think about that \u2013 you obviously have framed the magnitude of how you see the impact to different pieces. Do you feel that these are within a framework that you would be able to work to offset through other means, be it cost or investment, or is this kind of a net look?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. Well, I think maybe I'll talk about in terms of the shareholder impacts. When we talked about rate base, it was a cumulative impact of $300 million on rate base and again that's cumulative over a five-year period. So, I would certainly view that on a company of this size, there certainly would be other opportunities that we could pull forward or identify that would help offset that $300 million.","So, I think from a rate base standpoint, I'd certainly think that's manageable. Not much to say about the deferred tax impact at We Power, that would be a shareholder benefit, and that kind of leaves interest deductibility.","And I think I would just stress to you Jonathan and everybody on the call, all this that we put into the earnings deck, it's bit of a speculative enterprise, I mean we're just trying to give people a sense for the impacts. On the interest deductibility front, if you take one extreme where it's still deductible but at a 20% level, well, that's $0.05 a share on a base of say circa $3, so that'd be fairly small and I would expect that that's probably manageable.","As you start getting the things more like $0.15, that'd be tougher for us to manage. But as I look at it, I mean it's not a foregone conclusion, but that's where they're headed in terms of how this would be structured. Does that help?","Jonathan Philip Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","No, that's helpful. Thank you. And my other question was answered. So, I will see you. Thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","And your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hi, Dan.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi. Good afternoon. I also had a couple questions just around the tax, if the tax law changes, and it's more in terms of your capital structure. I've seen a number of studies saying that as tax rates go down or as tax interest deductibility becomes less of an issue, companies tend to have less leverage. Have you thought at all about any impacts on your capital structure strategy particularly, in terms of how you would capitalize your utilities for rate filings and so forth in terms of debt to equity ratios and so forth?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I've not thought about that a great deal at this point, Dan. But I think look if you basically or Congress makes changes in the tax that effectively changes the after-tax cost of the different components, you'd most certainly have to rethink what's the best capital structure for the utilities. But quite candidly, I haven't gotten to that level yet in my thinking.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then I just want to make sure on your page 18, where you show these preliminary estimates that I understand your note there under the holding company. We were saying that's only a change in rate and not additive so...","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. Scott, do you want to take the answer to that?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. And the reason for the note is, if there would be only a change of rate, it would be the $0.05 that we talked about at the holding company. When you go down the holding company page, if non-deductibility of interest would happen, it would be $0.14, so it's not additive. I don't want someone to go and add the $0.05 and $0.14 together, it's either $0.05 or $0.14, which once again, Allen talked about the non-deductibility of interest and where that would actually go.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. So you would use one or the other, but not...","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Correct.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","They're not netted in anyway.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Correct.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. I also had a question around debt. I guess, you saw the Bloomberg is changing rules for inclusion of debt issuance in their indices and a large number of your issues are going to fall out of the index given that they are at currently at a size of $250 million. I guess how do you expect to respond to that, while you tend to issue larger sizes going forward or do you think you still have adequate access to the debt markets if you issue at $250 million or have you thought about that?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So, that's a good question. And we'll be looking at as debt issuances come due. Probably we'll look at it in a couple of ways. One, there may be an opportunity to open some of the existing debt and get it at that larger level, so keep it at the index level. We will also look at, should we issue in larger amounts and maybe have to look at our CP program overall. But we've been very successful at the smaller utilities, even issue under the index size debt. So we've been successful either way. But we'll evaluate them as they come due and what's the most efficient to execute them.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then the last question I had is around the numbers on page 10 and 11. You had fairly sizable impacts in Wisconsin related to O&M that even after excluding the earning sharing. I was wondering if you could give some more color on what happened there in the fourth quarter in particular.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. In order to really look at the fourth quarter O&M, you really have to take a step back to 2015. So in 2015 as you recall, we had an extremely warm fourth quarter, and in that fourth quarter, we had to really look at our O&M expenses. And in the end, we had to control O&M expenses to get to our authorized return. And when you look at this year, we're just getting back to running the normal O&M in the projects that we were doing. There may be some timing between the third and fourth quarter, but we've really looked at the total expense over the entire year. So, there is a little more O&M, specifically in this fourth quarter, but it was exaggerated by what we did last year in 2015. But overall, we're able to hit our authorized return in all the jurisdictions. And like Allen mentioned, next year, we're looking about 3% reduction in total O&M.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Thank you.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","You're welcome.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Dan.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Joe Zhou (48:00) with Avon Advisors (sic) [Avon Capital]. Please go ahead.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","(48:04)","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","Thank you, guys. Hey. No, it's actually Andy Levi. How are you?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hey, Andy.","Andrew Stuart Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium Partners","I had a question on the growth rate, but I think you guys were very clear on that. So I'm all set. Thank you very much.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Andy.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, guys. I'm actually going to pick up where Andy just left off. Can you talk about how many \u2013 I know you're talking about 3% O&M down in the 2017 over 2016, so 2016 O&M was almost $2.2 billion. So, that's a pretty sizable chunk of O&M reduction. Do you see multiple years of this? I mean we've seen some of your peers go to mergers. One of the East Coast utilities did an acquisition or did a merger with a peer and they've been able to do four or five years of 2% to 3% O&M reductions. Just curious if you see that kind of runway ahead for cost saves, that would benefit both shareholders and other stakeholders including customers?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. Well, I think in terms of being able to continue to maintain O&M reductions, I do believe we'll have additional capacity to reduce O&M, Michael. But I would say, as you look out say to 2018, 2019, 2020, which I think is kind of more where you're going, the larger reductions in O&M are most likely going to be centered around our generation portfolio as we restructure that generation portfolio.","And let me just give you one example in particular, bridge back to the conversation or the prepared remarks when I was talking about the new gas-fired generation in the UP. Well, once we have that new generation online, and we're able to retire the Presque Isle Power Plant, the run rate of O&M at Presque Isle, it's about $40 million a year, which very, very significant both for Wisconsin Electric as well as the consolidated entity.","So, I do believe, there'll be additional opportunities, but the really big opportunities in terms of O&M reduction are going to come more from the generation side. There will be more modest, not unimportant but more modest opportunities and say, we implement our new ERP system, so now we're going through efforts where we're trying to get all of our utilities on common systems. So, as we implement our new ERP system in this year and in 2018, I would see more savings opportunities there, but that's a little more modest.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And one follow-up just on the Bluewater Gas acquisition, the gas storage acquisition. Can you all remind us where are your gas utilities currently buying storage from? And how should we think about what the impact of this, if you assume like a utility like return, what the impact of this is for the customer?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So right now, the largest single, say, third-party provider of storage is ANR. So, ANR is the largest single provider. I believe that they provide about 40% of the storage or thereabouts for the operating companies, so that's the biggest one Michael.","As the service agreements would be put in place, if you look at it from a present value standpoint, okay, so cover all the return of capital, cover all those costs, we would see roughly a $213 million net present value savings to customers. And in terms of the year where you would see an absolute reduction due to this, I think that's in year four, so pretty quickly gets to annual reduction in rates, and any increase in the early years, it's less than 1%, but present value, that's $200 million-plus \u2013 $213 million net present value, so very significant savings that we would see. Does that help Michael?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","That helps a lot. And one last one, I apologize for the short list here. First quarter guidance and I know weather has not been so wonderful January to date, but first quarter guidance seems a little tepid. Can you talk a little bit about, given you're much more gassy now than you were pre-Integrys, what that means in terms of your kind of where you think you'll fall within 2017's range, if it has any impact at all and maybe how you're thinking about how kind of \u2013 and I know you've touched on this a little bit, but kind of how you're thinking about the broader growth of the company over time, multi-years out?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. And Scott, why don't you address Michael's question about the first quarter?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. So the first quarter, you're correct Michael, the month of January right now is about 12% warmer than normal. It's like the seventh warmest in the last 57 years, so it's a pretty warm January. So, we did have an entry last year that took that $1.9 down to about $1.05. So if you take some weather of $0.01 or $0.02, we're kind of in the middle of the range that we provided. But it's really early in the year to say how that's going to affect our overall guidance, like Allen mentioned, we have a lot of O&M that we look at and monitor and we manage the business to get to our log (54:12) returns.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yeah. And then I think Michael, in terms of longer-term growth, I addressed that in the script and also talked a little bit about it in the response to Greg Gordon's question, was there any other aspect specifically about that that you want me to cover?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No, just kind of thinking about whether you see your electric business or your gas business, which of those two being a higher growth business and is the spread between the two significant? Are we talking about pennies or nickels, not dimes and quarters?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right. Well, in terms of \u2013 and let me talk about that in terms of capital allocation, if you will. So if you look at the five-year capital budget, just that half, in fact, maybe a little over half of the capital that we would expect to commit over the next five years is in the natural gas distribution business. So, given that the natural gas distribution as measured by rate base is about a quarter of the company, right now. In terms of percentage growth, we're going to see much greater or expect to see much greater percentage growth in earnings in the natural gas business than we would in electric. But in terms of absolute capital employed, it's almost even, electric versus gas. But in terms of percentage growth, most of it's going to come from gas we would expect.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Allen. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Allen L.

Thank you for waiting and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call to review the 2015 Third Quarter Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statement, factors described in WEC Energy Group's and Integrys Holding's latest Form 10-Ks and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today, as we review our results for the third quarter. This, of course, is our first full quarter as a newly combined company. We formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. I'll update you on our progress as a new company in just a moment.","But first as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President for Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","We also have one new member of our senior team with us today, Bill Guc. Bill is our new Vice President and Controller. He has more than 20 years of solid experience in our industry. Prior to the acquisition, he served as Treasurer of Integrys. Bill, welcome aboard.","Turning now to the third quarter, and I'd like to remind you that we're reporting our legacy Wisconsin Energy results only through the remainder of 2015. So the financial results and the guidance that we'll be discussing have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition.","Pat will review our results in detail in just a few minutes. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted standalone earnings of $0.61 a share for the third quarter of this year. That compares with adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the third quarter of 2014. We delivered strong results through an unusual pattern of summer weather, a cool July, a cool August, followed by an unseasonably warm September.","Taking a quick look at the state of the economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 4.3% in September, well below the national average and the lowest rate of unemployment we've seen here since back in April of 2001. And in the latest survey of the climate for business, Wisconsin was ranked the 12th best state for business by Chief Executive Magazine. This ranking represents a huge leap forward since 2010, when the state came in at 41st.","In this year's third quarter, residential use of electricity surged by 11.5% compared to last year's abnormally cool summer. Also, our small commercial and industrial segment grew slightly with electricity use rising by 1.6% over the third quarter of a year ago. And deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers, excluding the iron ore mines rose by 0.6% in the quarter.","Several sectors continued to show strength including food processing, printing and to Mrs. Robinson (4:12), plastics. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. We Energies is serving 6,000 more electric customers and 10,000 more natural gas customers today than we were a year ago.","Now, I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing our plans for the future of the new WEC Energy Group. When we first considered the opportunity to acquire Integrys, we weighed it against our three important criteria for evaluating any potential acquisition. And after considerable due diligence, we found that it met or exceeded all three criteria. First, it would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would be largely credit-neutral. And third, the long-term growth rate would be equal to or greater than Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate.","And, of course, over the past year, a number of similar deals have been announced, several as you know, in just the past few months. We're pleased that the metrics for our transaction compare very favorably to these recent announcements.","We also see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We plan to leverage these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders, from the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ to the shareholders who count on us to create value. And with our proven leadership team, we'll incorporate best practices across the organization to streamline the operations and reduce costs.","WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in America and one of the 15th largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States with significant opportunities for growth. Bottom line, we have the same top management team, but now with a new platform for growth, a platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest.","Now, let's touch on some of the key financial measures for the new company. For starters, we issued $1.5 billion of parent company debt to help finance the transaction. The all-in interest cost for the debt was 2.21% annually, an outstanding result and clearly lower than we had expected.","So, for 2016, we now project growth in earnings per share for the combined company to be in the range of 6% to 8%. 6% to 8% earnings growth for next year assumes that Wisconsin Energy standalone delivers earnings of $2.72 a share this year. For the longer term, we see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% annually, driven by operating efficiency, financial discipline and infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability and for improved environmental performance.","And on the subject of infrastructure upgrades, you may recall that we originally projected capital spending for the combined company in the range of $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion a year for the remainder of the decade and actually beyond. Now, about 120 days into the company, as we look at the spectrum of projects that need to be addressed to deliver industry-leading reliability, we're seeing even stronger investment opportunities. And in the latter part of the decade, our capital investments could range above $1.5 billion a year. With the few other minor changes to our estimates, we continue to project longer term earnings per share growth in the 5% to 7% a year range and we're comfortable at the midpoint of that range.","Lastly, a reminder about our dividend policy. In June, our board of directors raised the quarterly dividend to $0.4575 a share, an increase of 8.3% over the previous quarterly rate. This is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.83 a share. You may recall this was our second dividend increase during 2015. In total, we've raised the dividend by 17.3% this year. Going forward, we're targeting as you may have heard us say a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect dividend growth to be in line with growth in earnings per share. Looking forward, we expect to return to our normal pattern of dividend action. Management typically brings the dividend proposal to the board in January of each year and we would expect to do so in January of 2016.","Now, I'd like to spend just a few minutes discussing some of our operational highlights in the past quarter. First, I'm pleased to report that just two weeks ago We Energies was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth year in a row. And in recent national studies of large utility systems, We Energies is ranked in the top quartile of the Midwest for customer service and power quality and in the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service was ranked number two in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among midsized utilities.","We're also making progress on the Accelerated Main Replacement Project at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you recall, this is one of the largest infrastructure modernization programs in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines over the next 20 years. Some of those pipes ladies and gentlemen literally date back to the days of Abraham Lincoln. One of our most immediate and important goals is to improve the management and the performance of this project.","Since we closed the acquisition, we put in place an entirely new senior leadership team at Peoples, and we built an in-house construction management group with extensive project experience. They determined that the best approach for the Main Replacement program in Chicago is a fresh start. So over the past 100 days, we've transitioned the management of the project from an outside contractor to our experienced in-house team. We've also engaged a nationally known firm to help us conduct an independent review of the cost, scope and schedule for the program. We expect to submit this review and our recommendations to the Illinois Commerce Commission by the end of November. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will ensure that Chicagoans will have a safe, modern, natural gas delivery system that they deserve.","Then on the natural gas distribution side of our business in Wisconsin, I'm pleased to announce that our West Central Gas pipeline project is now complete and, as of November 1, in service. This was the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in company history. 85-mile line addresses reliability concerns and allows us to add a significant number of customers in the areas where propane use is the heaviest. The project came in on time and actually better than budget at just under $130 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","On the power generation side of our business, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal, but given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year in fuel cost, depending on the blend.","We're working now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site and the first capital improvements inside the plant began in September during a planned outage for one of the two units. We plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of next year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Next, the conversion of our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas is now more than 97% complete with only tuning and just punch list items remaining for the project. So our conversion costs will be $60 million to $62 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction. We expect to complete the work at the Valley Plant on time and on budget within the next 30 days.","We also continue to make good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation, we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity that will meet current federal standards.","Overall, the project is on time and on budget with approximately 60% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of 2016 and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Looking ahead, we continue to see significant investment opportunities as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. We plan to provide you, as we promised, with more details on our capital investment plans for the next 10 years at the EEI Conference in just a few days.","Turning to our transmission business, WEC Energy Group, I would remind you, is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. And as you may have seen, ATC recently updated its 10-year capital plan. The plan has slightly lower growth in the near term, but it calls for ATC to invest $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. This latest projection is up from the previous 10-year plan. That previous plan, as you recall, had an investment ranging from $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business.","On a final note, we've completed our evaluation of the compressed natural gas business that we inherited with the acquisition of Integrys. That business is known as Trillium CNG. We've determined that the enterprise has value, but does not fit our focus on our core regulated business. As a result, we're now seeking a new owner for Trillium.","So in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times, filled with opportunity for our company, and we believe we have a very bright future ahead.","Now, for more details on our third quarter performance and our outlook for the remainder of the year, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?","J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 third quarter Wisconsin Energy standalone adjusted earnings were $0.61 a share. That compares to adjusted earnings of $0.57 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys company's earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger.","To facilitate comparisons with last year's third quarter, my discussion of results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys company and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation. We will continue this practice for the remainder of 2015.","First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Third quarter adjusted consolidated operating income was $262.2 million as compared with adjusted income of $249.1 million in 2014. That's an improvement of $13.1 million.","Starting with Utility Energy, adjusted operating income in the third quarter totaled $168.5 million for 2015, an improvement of $10.1 million from the third quarter of 2014. On a quarter-over-quarter basis, weather helped our earnings by $27.6 million. We had a warmer than normal September in 2015 and a very cool third quarter in 2014. We were also helped by $12 million of improved fuel recoveries and $10.1 million from the impact of the 2015 rate case.","On the downside, we saw an increase in utility operations and maintenance costs of $36 million, primarily driven by increased regulatory amortizations, the timing of projects and certain benefits costs. And we also saw increased depreciation expense of $3.6 million associated with higher capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results in a $10.1 million increase in adjusted utility operating income in the third quarter of 2015 compared with the same quarter last year.","Our non-utility operating income was $93.2 million, which is $1.2 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our adjusted corporate and other improved slightly by $1.8 million over the previous year. Taking these changes together, you arrive at Wisconsin Energy's third quarter adjusted operating income of $262.2 million. This is a $13.1 million improvement over the third quarter of 2014.","During the third quarter of this year, earnings from our investment in American Transmission Company totaled $17.6 million, a decline of $400,000 compared to the same period in the prior year. As we previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. These earnings only reflect Wisconsin Energy's standalone share of ATC's results. Other income net increased by $900,000, driven by higher AFUDC, and our adjusted net interest expense increased by $700,000, primarily because of higher utility debt levels.","Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $4 million for the quarter. We expect that Wisconsin Energy's standalone effective tax rate for the calendar year will be between 37% and 38%. WEC Energy Group's effective income tax rate, driven by a onetime adjustment related to the acquisition of Integrys, is expected to be between 38% and 39% for 2015. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $138.2 million, or $0.61 a share for the third quarter of 2015.","Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group exclusively on a GAAP basis and, thus, this includes three months of result from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company.","During the first nine months of 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flow totaled $1.073 billion, which is a $39 million improvement over the first nine months of 2014. Operating cash flows were helped by improved working capital, lower natural gas prices dropped accounts receivable balances and reduced the cost of gas and storage.","Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $100 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014.","Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio as of September 30, 2015 is 50.3%. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of the WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","For comparison purposes, the sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for We Energies only. Actual third quarter retail deliveries rose by 0.9%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries increased by 4.4%. Weather-normalized retail deliveries, again excluding iron ore mines, were flat compared to the third quarter of 2014.","Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries rise by 1.4%, and as Gale mentioned, actual residential deliveries rose by 11.5%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries fell by 0.7%. Actual deliveries rose by 1.6%. And in the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for the third quarter of 2015 fell by 8.2%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries rose by 0.6%.","Our year-to-date weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation dropped 0.4% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation were down 6.7% compared to the polar vortex driven gas sales last year.","Moving to other items of interest. In September of 2015, Wisconsin Gas issued a $200 million, 10-year bond at a coupon of 3.53%. In part, this new bond is replacing $125 million bond with a coupon of 5.2% that comes due in December.","Turning now to our 2015 earnings forecast. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to guide based on adjusted standalone earnings for Wisconsin Energy. And again, for your reference, adjusted earnings exclude the results of Integrys, exclude the impacts of the acquisition and adjust for the additional shares that were issued as part of the acquisition.","Wisconsin Energy's adjusted earnings through the third quarter are $2.10 per share. Taking into account the impact of a relatively warm October as we enter the heating season and assuming normal weather for the rest of the quarter, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share. Thus, the 2015 adjusted earnings forecast for Wisconsin Energy is $2.72 a share. At $2.72, Wisconsin Energy's regulated utilities will earn at or near their allowed rates of return. So again, we project our fourth quarter adjusted earnings to be $0.62 per share.","Finally, I'd like to announce our earnings guidance for 2016. As Gale mentioned, we forecast earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in the range of 6% to 8% off a projected base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in the range from $2.88 a share to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 per share to $2.94 per share.","And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Terrific. Pat, thank you. Overall, we're solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And now we would like to take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Jonathan. How are you today? Well, Jonathan, I know it's tough.","J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","Or muted.","Operator","And Jonathan, please make sure your line is not on mute.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First-time caller, long-time listener I think. All right. Why don't we go to the next call?","Operator","Yes, sir. Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How's your mute button, Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon. I'm still here.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good. How are you doing?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Quite well. Thank you. Perhaps just to kick off the conversation, the comment on the latter part of the decade, around the $1.5 billion, could you, one, elaborate around what would be driving that? What would the investment be? Where would it be oriented? And then also confirm for us, would that require equity or is the balance sheet in a sufficient place to deal with the incremental capital?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","First of all, let me just reiterate, no expectation of additional equity, period. And then, in terms of the types of projects that we're seeing, we'll give you some really granular detail at the EEI Conference on the 10-year capital spending and on the uptick that we're seeing in the latter part of the decade.","But let me just say, in general, we're seeing additional requirements, additional capital spending for upgrades and expansion particularly with natural gas in Wisconsin, and for that matter, in Minnesota. So, they're really infrastructure projects; they're the kinds of things we have been talking about. But as we looked across \u2013 as I mentioned, across the spectrum of projects now with the new combined company, we're really seeing infrastructure needs that are going to drive the capital spending higher.","Now, if you recall, as we made the acquisition, we indicated that we would \u2013 our number one priority, if there were legitimate needed projects, would be to deploy some of our positive free cash flow to that type of investment. So, basically, what we're saying is that over the course of the last 120 days, as we've really refined our estimates and looked at the spectrum of projects, we're seeing higher capital spend out in those years, largely delivery networks, a lot of it gas.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. Excellent. And then, let me cut back, and I know this is a little preempting next week a bit, but you talk about the fresh start, to use your words, does that impact the timing of the CapEx on the people side of the business, and perhaps what drove you to come to that conclusion? Can you elaborate a little bit on what exactly that means?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The answer is certainly for this year and for the near term, I wouldn't expect any change in the capital projections for Peoples Gas.","And from the standpoint \u2013 and let me explain. There are only so many streets you can dig up in Chicago at one time. So in essence, we are physically limited as to how much progress you can make in any given year in terms of the gas-main replacement program of those 2,000 miles of pipes under the streets of Chicago. So that \u2013 I mean, there's a governing factor that is driven mostly by just the physical capability of how many streets can you dig up and repair. That's number one.","Number two, related to the fresh start, I mean, as you may recall, there was a Commission-mandated audit of the management of the program. It was a rather critical audit. The prior management had outsourced the management of this project, and we really felt like bringing in an experienced construction management team was very important to the future of the project and to managing that project well.","And that team has looked at the project controls and all of the other issues that they found, and that's why we've decided to go back with a fresh start, with a whole new bottoms-up analysis, and you will see when we file publicly on November 30 what our long-term cost projections are and what our immediate priorities will be.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. Thank you all. See you soon.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look forward to it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho Securities. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How are you doing, Jim.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","I'm good. How are you, Gale?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're good.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Hey, I'm looking for some Bucks tickets. Know anyone who could get me some? Okay. On to more important topics. First thing, besides the Bucks, Trillium book value and the tax basis and what your expected uses of proceeds are?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll talk to Allen about that, but I believe the book value is around $130 million.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. That's basically similar?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No, it's probably three-quarters of that.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Switching over to cash flow, I'm not trying to become a debt analyst, but the \u2013 and you guys over the years have been very helpful with earnings guidance and dividend expectations, but less so on the cash flow side of things. So when you look at your FFO productions, can you just book-end how much of that FFO comes from, say, Power the Future, and then if you add in Illinois, relative to the total FFO amount?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Jim, we don't have that kind of detail in the room with us today. I mean, we can...","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We can, off line, kind of give you some broad estimates, but we just don't have \u2013 I mean, we want to give you the right kind of answers. We just don't have that specificity in the room with us today. The entire brain thrust is here, but we don't have that kind of specificity.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. And then are you seeing any \u2013 well, we'll talk about that offline. But as a follow-up to that, are you seeing any calls on your cash in the near term to intermediate term? Intermediate being defined as, say, two years to three years. This year, you did your pension contribution for the first time. Is there any changes with respect to like deferred taxes and the like?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, obviously, the short answer is no. However, there's going to be a lot of developments particularly towards the end of the year, and specifically related to whether or not Congress renews or extends bonus depreciation.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Right.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","For many companies including ours, that's a very big number. Now, from a cash standpoint, we have not factored in the potential uptick of bonus appreciation, again, from a cash standpoint in 2016 or beyond. We're just very conservative from that standpoint. We're not going to make any assumptions until we see the legislation actually signed and in place. But those are very \u2013 those could be \u2013 that could be a very big swing.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","No, I get it. Okay. And then the last question still on this debt analyst path, fixed debt versus variable debt. If I did my math correctly on the combined entity, the debt is basically entirely fixed that you have. I think there's a few resets that switch over to variable in the next three years to five years. But nothing really to get worked up about in the event that Fed finally decides to start moving rates. Is that correct?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, gosh, yeah. I mean, the lion's share of our debt is absolutely fixed. You are correct. There are a couple of hybrid issuances, one at legacy WEC, one at Integrys, that could switch over in 2017 and 2016, 2017 for us, 2017 for legacy WEC, 2016 for Integrys that could switch over. But they switch over even if the Fed raised rates a little at incredibly low levels, like LIBOR plus 2.12%. I mean, so they're very competitive, if they do \u2013 when they do switch over.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Super. That's all I had. Thanks, guys. See you in Florida.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Look forward to it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Hi, good afternoon, Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Jonathan. Did that mute button sick?","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","There's some rumor I might have fallen asleep here.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We were that scintillating in the call, huh?","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","I thought I needed to refute that.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How are you doing, Jonathan, other than those naps are wonderful.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. So, one \u2013 just a couple of small things, your O&M, as we think about pro forma and where it came in, in the quarter. Is $500 million a quarter a decent run rate expectation, just as we're wrestling with the pro forma model?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're looking at each other here. It's within the ballpark, maybe a hair high, but it's within the ballpark.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. Thank you. And then, we have one other. Just as we think about TEG in fourth quarter and try unfolding that in, we're likely to see a dilution in Q4, or possibly accretion given the winter waiting?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, I wouldn't think you'd see dilution in Q4, but remember, one of the reasons why, Jonathan, we're focusing on legacy WEC performance for the remainder of the year is there are \u2013 as we go through purchase price accounting, as we go through transition costs, as we go through any remaining acquisition costs, which should be very small at this point, there are a lot of moving pieces and a lot of one-time things that affect the Integrys performance financially from a reporting standpoint in the fourth quarter.","So, again, we think it's almost fruitless to try to give you a GAAP number, and to concentrate on the GAAP number for the Integrys performance in the fourth quarter. Having said that, January 1, 2016 is combined company rock and roll.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","So, from 2016, you're going to give \u2013 you're not going to keep doing this through the year after the close or anything like that?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely not. You will see combined results. That's what we will focus on. That's what we report. And Jonathan, that's what our earnings guidance that Pat just gave you for 2016 is based on.","Jonathan P. Arnold - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Yeah. Good. Okay. Great. Well, thank you very much, and thanks for the insights.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, Jonathan.","J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","(35:14).","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hey. How are you doing?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're great. How about you, Paul?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm managing...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Now, the last time I asked about wonderful and award-winning, and you weren't quite there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, I'm always striving. Always striving (35:34).","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Okay. We'll try to be helpful.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I want to turn to the accelerated main replacement program in Illinois.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So now it looks like the projections are that it'll be considerably more CapEx, I would assume. Could you give us a flavor for how much we should be seeing annually that being driven by and just sort of the causation that we're seeing there and also the rate impact, I guess, cumulatively over this period of time? I mean, it just seems like a lot that we're reading about.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. And I appreciate you're asking the question. Let me clarify two or three very key points here. First of all, this was designed initially to be a 20-year program. When we walked into the door after the acquisition, there had been an estimate, a revised estimate made by the previous outsourced firm that the cost might rise to as much as, say, $8 billion over the 20-year period.","I don't think the previous management had confidence in that estimate. We did not have confidence in that estimate. That's why we brought in our experienced team and another outside nationally known firm to basically take a complete bottoms-up review.","Having said that, the legislation that enables this program to move forward with current and appropriate cost recovery caps the amount of capital spending on this program at roughly $250 million a year. From what I have seen personally over the last 120 days, it would be extremely difficult. I mentioned earlier there are only so many streets you can dig up, and you can't do a lot of this work in the dead of winter.","So, from a weather standpoint and just a sheer congestion and major city standpoint, I don't think you could technically just physically spend much more than about $250 million a year anyway. So, I wouldn't make the assumption. I think it'd be an inappropriate assumption that we would be spending much more on that advanced main replacement program in any given year than $250 million to $300 million.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Does that help, Paul?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","It does help. And I guess in terms of that $8 billion number which clearly you guys are reviewing, I mean, when do you think we're going to get or when will you guys get a better idea about what the \u2013 would you be able to share with us what you think the actual number will be? And I'm just wondering, I mean, you talk about digging up streets and stuff. I mean, there are some things that you hear about and which you could do things without digging up the street, if you follow me, in terms of like liner or stuff and what have you, I don't know. I'm just wondering whether or not...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're going to try fracking down there.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Well, that will solve some transportation issues.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That'll solve the problem, exactly. I mean, there are \u2013 there's something called keyhole technology which we are experimenting with right now. But having said that, just the sheer logistics, I would still believe that given the weather constraints and the sheer logistics, we're probably physically capped at the $250 million to $300 million a year.","Now, you asked, when are we going to see more specific estimates? Well, the date is November 30. We've promised the Illinois Commerce Commission that we will file on November 30, our longer-term cost estimates for the 20-year period. Now, as you know, trying to estimate precisely the cost of the construction program that is going to span 20 years, you know the only thing we're going to be is wrong.","So, we will probably give a range of values. We'll probably have a low case, a medium case, and a high case. And then I would expect that what we will really focus on is, okay, those are projections but what are we going to do in the next three years to make the most progress in getting that natural gas delivery system as safe and efficient as possible?","I think you'll see a broad range for a lengthy period of time, so low case, high case, medium case. And then we will really focus on what we plan to do in the next three years and what the cost of that is, and what the progress will be. And all of that look forward to November 30.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Now in terms of rate impact, and I think \u2013 I'm glad you asked that question. The legislation basically caps at that $250 million to $300 million a year. Caps consumer rate increases at an average of 4%. But it's very important to understand what that 4% is based on. That 4% is based on what we call base rates. So, base rates make up like less than a third of a residential customer's gas bill. The rest is the commodity. So we're not talking about tremendous rate pressure here. We're talking about 4% off of \u2013 we're talking about basically 4% on a third of the total customer bill each year.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then I guess just, when you say the 20 years, I mean this project's been going on for some time. I mean...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Not really.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","...or it hasn't? Because I mean, so we're not talking 2030, or are we talking \u2013 what is the date and time we're talking about I guess?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Officially, I mean there was some work done I think in 2012 and 2013, but basically under the legislation, really March 2014. I think that the hope was that a lot could be accomplished by 2030. Again, we're taking a hard, fresh bottoms-up look at this, but we're talking about a very extensive period of time.","And the one thing \u2013 and I've spent a lot of time personally in Chicago with the team over the last couple of months, and the one thing that is very clear to me is that from the Mayor's office to the common council to the Illinois Commerce Commission, there is outstanding and common agreement that this program has to move forward. It has to be done efficiently. It has to be managed well, but Chicago has to have the modern efficient system that it deserves.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're more than welcome, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Rock and roll, Michael.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Hey, Gale. Congrats on a good quarter. Real quickly, just when you think about transmission spend and the CapEx change at ATC, can you frame how much of the near-term, meaning the next two to three years, has changed relative to what was prior \u2013 previously in the public domain?","J. Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer, Director & Executive VP","There's very little change. I mean, when you look at 10-year plan to 10-year plan, Michael, there's really very little change in the frontend. I'm sure you've seen these \u2013 if you look at the 10-year estimates, the previous estimates were in the range of $3.3 million to $3.9 million. The new estimates are in the range of $3.7 million to $4.5 million.","So over a 10-year period, they're talking about somewhat more capital spending. But in the very short term, which I think was the source of your question, two years to three years, not seeing a heck of a lot of change, which is kind of what you would expect, because these projects take a long time to get approved and then they're typically multi-year in nature.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And when you think about the next two to three, three to four years at ATC, how much of those projects have already received siting, already received permitting, are kind of close to shovel-ready or are virtually shovel-ready now?","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Well, I would say anything two years out is virtually...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Done, yeah.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","...is already \u2013 you've gone through the approvals, because again going back to what I said, the projects are typically multi-year. And then as you get farther and farther out obviously, less and less would already have gone through the regulatory process.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Allen is exactly right. If you think about the gestation period on some of these larger projects, they can be \u2013 from conceptual, design to approval, they could be five years. So, I think you could clearly conclude what Allen is saying that the next couple of two, three years, virtually everything they've included is largely through the approval process.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And when you're looking at demand on the gas utility side, how different do you see demand, or how much do you expect demand to differ in Wisconsin relative to Illinois and some of the other Integrys service areas?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I would expect, given normal weather conditions, demand in Wisconsin and Minnesota and, to some extent, Michigan to grow more strongly than Illinois simply because there's just not a lot of propane use in the City of Illinois. By contrast, Wisconsin, Michigan and Minnesota are three of the 10 heaviest using \u2013 heaviest propane using states in the U.S.","And, for example, in Minnesota, recently, there was legislation passed that in essence reduces the upfront hook-up cost for customers to switch over to the natural gas delivery network that allows more of those capital costs to be basically put into rate base as opposed to the individual customer having to pay more or hooking into the system, and that was done because of the very significant concern in Minnesota about what happened in 2014 during the polar vortex with propane supplies. So, we would expect Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan, in terms of gas demand and growth in gas customers, to be stronger.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thanks, guys. Much appreciated.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome. See you in Florida, Michael.","Michael Jay Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Sounds great.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hello, Paul. How are you today?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Well, Gale. Yourself?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're doing well. (46:04).","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Oh, yeah. You got me, I'm not going to go there, okay? Now, that you've had kind of a few months to digest the transaction, can you kind of give us an update on maybe what you're seeing as potential synergy opportunities?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me start by saying that we really have not had any major negative surprises. Essentially, I think we did a good job of due diligence in what we're seeing in terms of the best practices, in terms of driving costs down, in terms of more efficient operations. I think all the potential we saw is really there. So, I would first say the one upside for the past 120 days is the clear identification of infrastructure upgrades beyond what we thought in our due diligence and that led to what I discussed about the higher capital spending on rate base opportunities here in the latter part of the decade.","In terms of cost reductions, remember this transaction was far more about growth than about cost reductions. The cost reductions we have estimated basically will be needed in any given year to help us make sure we earn our allowed rates of return. So, again, I don't want to make \u2013 I want to make sure that no one is thinking that there are going to be huge cost savings that are then going to somehow result in earnings above the allowed rates of return. That's not the plan, and that's not what we're seeing.","I will say this, though, I think long term, there will be significant and tangible savings. There's no question about that. And even in Wisconsin, let me reiterate what we said earlier, and that is over the next 10 years, I see in a combination of capital cost savings and O&M savings, at least $1 billion of cost savings. Again, that's a combination of capital and O&M. And the first tangible result of that was when we were able to \u2013 with the Commission's approval, we were able to take off the table the need for Wisconsin Public Service to build a Fox 3, which was a combined cycle natural gas unit that had been planned. And that's a $600 million investment that we can postpone for a very long time. So that's a tangible savings for customers right there.","We will see, over time, for example, in just having to build only one, and it's being built by Integrys right now, only one new major customer information and billing system, the project is called ICE, and those projects are about $120 million, $150 million a pop. Well, we're only going to need to build one of them, and that's being built right now. So, you can see all across our operations how we can drive cost savings over time. I hope that responds to your question.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","It does. And can you \u2013 for a while, it seemed as though mining frac sand had some upside to it. What's the status of that industry?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We have about 110 frac sand, mining or processing operations in the Western part of Wisconsin. That is up from literally 10, five years ago. So that industry literally has just burgeoned over the course of the past five years, 10 to 110. Now, those 110 operations because of the price of oil, and lesser demand for frac sand, those operations are down. I think we're seeing about \u2013 of those we are serving today with natural gas, about an 11% decline this year in their natural gas demand. However, we were not serving anywhere near all of those 110 operations because we didn't have the infrastructure backbone to support that.","I mentioned earlier, that our West Central Gas expansion project is now complete; that 85-mile line. That will allow us to sign up more of those operations. So, we're going to see growth in the therms that we deliver to that industry in Western Wisconsin over time, simply because we weren't serving that many of them during the boom times. As I said, they are down about 11% in terms of therms now, but we're going to be serving more of them, now that we have completed the West Central line.","In fact, one of the major frac sand operators has just signed a contract with us to switch over from propane to natural gas. And remember, the ones we're not serving now are basically drying their sand with propane and their preference would be to move to less costly, more predictable natural gas. Does that respond to your question?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Perfectly. And then, lastly, just on the fresh look on main replacement, which way do you think that $8 billion number goes?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When we have a firm number and file it on November 30, you'll be the first to know.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I look forward to your call.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Terrific. Thank you very much.","Paul T.

Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's conference call to review 2014 first quarter earnings call. This conference call is being recorded for rebroadcast. [Operator Instructions] Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language.","All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated.","During the discussion, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers.","In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at www.wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately 2 hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale E. Klappa","Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 first quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer.","Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter of 2014. This compares with earnings of $0.76 a share for last year's first quarter. The results were much stronger during the first 3 months of this year, primarily because of the extreme winter weather that gripped our service area. In fact, we delivered more natural gas to our customers during the first quarter of 2014 than during any other quarter in history. We exceeded the previous record for gas deliveries set in the first quarter of 2008 by more than 11%.","On the generation side of our business, our newest coal units, the expansion units at our Oak Creek site, performed exceptionally well. And total sales of power from our generating fleet, over and above the demand from our retail and wholesale customers, were up more than 157% in the first quarter. The margin on these sales helps our customers by reducing our fuel costs, and the capacity helps to keep the lights on and energy flowing throughout the region.","Now as all of you know, the price of natural gas in the Midwest spiked pretty significantly during the first quarter. We estimate that our new generating units saved our customers more than $42 million in fuel costs this quarter because the units ran on coal as compared to natural gas. Ladies and gentlemen, this is another compelling example of the value of fuel diversity.","Our distribution network also performed very well during the harshest winter conditions that we've seen in more than 30 years. And as we saw, our deliver the future program provides some early dividends for our customers. As part of deliver the future, we accelerated the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines on our network. These are the very lines that are the most susceptible to problems and leaks, given severe cold weather.","Turning now to the state of the economy. Wisconsin's unemployment rate declined to 5.9% in March and remains well below the national average. The unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it's been since 2008. With a bit brighter economic backdrop, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers rose by 1.6% in the first quarter. We saw strength in several sectors, including paper manufacturing, food processing, rubber and plastics and chemical production.","In addition, we continue to see stronger customer growth across our system. New electric service connections are currently up 4.4%, and new natural gas installations are up by more than 7%. This reflects a rebound in home building in our region and the volume of customers who are switching from propane to natural gas.","Next, I'd like to update you on 2 of our larger construction projects that we have underway. First, you'll recall that we're planning to convert the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The Valley plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menominee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley, of course, generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown business center and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network.","I'm pleased to report that we received final approval from the Wisconsin Commission in March, and we've issued a full notice to proceed to our general contractor. We plan to complete the conversion of 2 boilers at the Valley plant in 2014 and the remaining 2 boilers in 2015. We're projecting the costs to be in the range of $65 million to $70 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","You may recall that in March of last year, we also began a major upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the facility. This pipeline replacement project has an estimated cost of $26 million and is on time and on budget.","Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts, and we believe our plan will help support a vibrant downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.","Next, I'd like to touch on the work we have underway to upgrade our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. In October of last year, we began building a new powerhouse at the Twin Falls site on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Twin Falls is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. It was built back in 1912. It's licensed to operate until the year 2040, but the existing powerhouse badly needs repair. We considered several alternatives but the most prudent course is to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity that meets current federal standards. Since our last update, engineering and preconstruction activities have begun and major construction activity will begin in the next few weeks.","Work to excavate rock and build cofferdams is scheduled for completion this year. We expect the new powerhouse will then be operational in 2015 and the existing powerhouse to be removed in 2016.","The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Switching gears now. Our board, as you may recall, has authorized us to repurchase up to $300 million of Wisconsin Energy common stock from 2014 through 2017. This is the second phase of our repurchase program. You may recall that our board had previously authorized the purchase of up to $300 million of common stock from 2011 through 2013. So in the first quarter of this year, we purchased approximately 426,000 shares. In total, since our buyback program began, we've repurchased 8,103,000 shares at a cost of $296.4 million. This equates to an average purchase price of $36.58 a share.","And as we've previously announced, our board has adopted a dividend policy that trends to a 65% to 70% payout ratio in 2017. This policy should support annual dividend increases of 7% to 8% from 2015 to 2017, as we move to a payout ratio that is more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector.","In January, our board raised the quarterly dividend to $0.39 a share, an increase of 30% over the dividend that was paid during 2012. The new quarterly dividend is equivalent to an annual rate of $1.56 a share.","Next, I'd like to discuss the investment opportunities that we see in our core business as we focus on delivering the future. As we previously reported, our capital budget calls for spending $3.2 billion to $3.5 billion over the 5-year period 2014 through 2018. In this 5-year budget, the nature of our capital investments is shifting away from the higher-profile projects such as our Power the Future units, renewable generation and larger quality controls. Instead, our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will upgrade our aging distribution infrastructure. For the next 5 years, we will focus on pipes, poles, wires, transformers and substations, the building blocks of our delivery business.","Between now and the end of '18, we plan to rebuild 2,000 miles of electric distribution lines that are today more than 50 years old. We also intend to replace 18,500 power poles, 20,000 transformers and literally hundreds of substation components.","On the natural gas side of our business, we plan to replace 1,100 miles of vintage plastic and steel gas mains, as well as 83,000 individual gas distribution lines and approximately 233,000 meter sets.","Of course, the primary risks associated with these projects, developmental, legal, regulatory and construction, are naturally more manageable, given the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work. But this work is no less valuable or important than the megaprojects we've completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status as one of the most reliable utilities in America.","So we'll keep you posted as these needed infrastructure upgrades move forward.","We're also making excellent progress, I'm pleased to report, on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted, you may recall, to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous and Powder River Basin coal, blending the 2 types of coal could save our customers $25 million to $50 million a year in fuel cost, depending on the mix. In May of last year, we received all the environmental approvals we need and began testing a blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal at the plant. Test results continue to be promising. Further testing is scheduled to identify equipment modifications that could be needed to permanently increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal used at the Oak Creek expansion units. If significant modifications are required, we expect to seek approval from the Wisconsin Commission in late 2014.","On the natural gas side of our business, we're planning to build a new natural gas lateral in west-central Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Commission has scheduled technical and public hearings for mid-May on this project, and we anticipate a commission decision in the third quarter of this year. The 85 mile line would run from Eau Claire County in the far western part of the state to the city of Tomah in Monroe County. The project will address reliability concerns in Western Wisconsin and meet growing demand. Demand is being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in the region.","I might add that all 10 communities along our preferred route have now passed resolutions authorizing us to begin operating natural gas distribution systems within their borders. If we receive timely approval, we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of 2015. The project is expected to cost between $150 million and $170 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","This winter's bitter cold simply underscores the need to expand our natural gas distribution network in the western part of the state. You may have read there were serious propane shortages across the region, and as I mentioned, we delivered more natural gas to customers during the first quarter of this year than during any other quarter in history.","We're also pursuing and launching another potential investment opportunity, the potential sale of the state of Wisconsin's electric and steam-generating plants. Last year, Governor Walker signed into law a new state budget. That budget includes a provision expanding the state's authority to sell or lease certain state-owned properties. This means that the administration has the authority to pursue the sale of the state's electric steam and chilled water production and distribution facilities. The state is moving forward and is now in the final stages of selecting a financial advisor and a broker for the potential sale of a number of assets, including the plants. No formal timetable has been announced but if the sale does take place, we expect it would occur in 2015.","Turning now to Wisconsin regulatory matters. In May, we plan to file a request with the Wisconsin Commission that will cover our investment and our projected expenses for the 2015 and 2016 test years.","And finally, before closing my remarks, I'd like to provide an update on our operations in Michigan. Under Michigan law, retail customers may choose an alternative energy supplier. The law limits customer choice to 10% of Michigan's retail sales. But the law excludes from this cap the iron ore mines in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The 2 iron ore mines that we were serving on a low-margin, interruptible tariff switched to an alternative supplier in September of 2013. Several smaller retail customers have switched as well. Of course, we continue to provide distribution and customer service functions regardless of the power supplier. We've taken and will continue to take multiple steps to address this situation. We filed a request with MISO, the mid-continent grid operator, to suspend the operation of all 5 of our units at the Presque Isle Power Plant. Last fall, however, MISO determined that all the units are necessary to maintain reliability in Northern Michigan. As a result, we're eligible for system support resource payments from MISO to recover our costs for operating the units. Under our agreement, MISO will pay us an availability fee to ensure that the units are maintained and available to run and a fee to cover our costs when the units are actually operating. On April 1, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission accepted our 1-year agreement with MISO. The payments will be retroactive to February 1 of this year.","It's also important to note that we will need to invest in environmental upgrades at the Presque Isle plant to meet EPA's Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by 2016. Since we expect the units will still be needed for reliability at that time, we anticipate the cost of these upgrades will be reimbursed through an agreement with MISO.","So in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen, our company is off to a strong start, both financially and operationally, in 2014. And now for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, the famous Pat Keyes.","James Patrick Keyes","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2014 first quarter earnings were $0.91 a share compared with $0.76 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2013.","Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our 2 business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.","Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $381.8 million as compared to $321 million in 2013. That's an increase of $60.8 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, you will see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $292.7 million for 2014, an increase of $62.1 million over the first quarter of 2013.","On a quarter-over-quarter basis, we estimate that our electric and gas margins improved by $32.6 million because of the weather. We experienced temperatures that were 24% colder than normal and 16% colder than last year. Our earnings were also helped by $14.2 million related to the accounting on the treasury grant for our new biomass plant.","Last year, we could not recognize the grant income until the plant was complete. Finally, our utility nonfuel operations and maintenance costs are down by $13 million, driven in large part by lower pension and medical costs.","Now turning to our nonutility segment. Operating income in this segment was down $1.4 million when compared to 2013. Last year, we recorded onetime entries to reflect the final approval of our Power the Future plant cost in the last Wisconsin rate case. Making the changes for these 2 segments together and a slight improvement in corporate and other, you arrive at the $60.8 million increase in operating income.","During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $17.3 million, an increase of $700,000 over the same period last year. These earnings are in line with our expectations.","Our other income net declined by $3.3 million, primarily because of lower AFUDC. AFUDC decreased as a result of the completion of the biomass plant last November. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.7 million, primarily because of lower debt levels. Our debt at the end of this quarter was $56.4 million lower than at the end of last year's first quarter. Consolidated income tax expense rose by $29.9 million because of higher pretax earnings and a higher effective tax rate. Our effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $207.6 million of net income for the first quarter 2014 or earnings of $0.91 per share. Our earnings per share also were helped by approximately $0.01 because of our share repurchases.","During the first quarter of 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $385.1 million, which is a $54.8 million increase from 2013. The increase came primarily from higher net income and a better working capital position.","Our capital expenditures totaled $129.2 million in the first quarter, a $4.4 million decrease compared to 2013. We saw slightly lower expenditures because construction of the biomass project was completed in 2013. Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of March. Our calculation to reach half of our hybrid securities is common equity, which is consistent with past presentations.","The projected year-end debt to total capital is expected to be relatively flat with 2013 year end. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","We also paid $88.1 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2014, an increase of $10.3 million over the first quarter last year. Dividends for 2014 equate to an annual rate of $1.56 per share.","And as shown in the earnings package on our website, retail deliveries of electricity rose by 3.6% in the first quarter of 2014 as compared to the first quarter of 2013. Our normalized first quarter sales were up by 1.7%.","Looking at the individual customer segments, with the extremely cold weather, we saw actual residential sales up 5.8%, and on a normalized basis, residential sales were up 1.7%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, we saw quarterly delivery sales up 3.8%, and on a normalized basis, sales of small commercial and industrial customers were up 1.8%.","In the large commercial and industrial segment, on a normalized basis, delivery sales for the first quarter of 2014 were up 1.6%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines, sales were up 1.8%. Overall, these results are ahead of our expectations.","First quarter retail natural gas sales were up nearly 19% compared to the first quarter of 2013. On a normalized basis, sales improved by 3.2%. These results are also ahead of our expectations for the year.","Turning now to our earnings forecast. First, we are raising our 2014 guidance. Our prior guidance was $2.53 a share to $2.63 a share. Our revised guidance is $2.58 a share to $2.64 a share. While our first quarter clearly exceeded our expectations, we still have 9 more months of weather ahead of us. So again, our revised guidance for 2014 is $2.58 a share to $2.64 a share. And for the second quarter, our guidance is $0.49 a share to $0.51 a share. This assumes normal weather. Our second quarter guidance is slightly lower than the $0.52 we earned in the second quarter of 2013 due to the timing of operations and maintenance expense and fuel recoveries.","And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa","Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS.","Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","This is actually Paul Zimbardo for Julien. Just a quick question on the plant in the environmental recovery. Could you provide kind of a little background there and time line, if you could?","Gale E. Klappa","The plant in the environmental -- are you talking about...","Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","The SSR in Presque Isle.","Gale E. Klappa","Yes, okay. Let me frame it for you and Allen can give you some of the details. As I mentioned in the prepared remarks, one way to look at this really is that MISO, the Midwest grid operator, has basically become the principal customer for that plant. So MISO, under our agreement and with approval from FERC, is basically paying us to operate the plant. Now the plant will become subject to the new Mercury and Air Toxics Standards by 2016. So environmental investments will be needed if the plant is going to continue to operate. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett","Right. And Julian (sic) [Paul], that's of course, the MATS rule that we have to be in compliance with by April of 2016. So our expectation would be that we would be able to do dry sorbent injection at the plant. Cost range for that, when we were doing some testing in June, but I would expect that the range of costs for that in terms of a capital investment is $6 million to $12 million is a likely range, if we had to do dry sorbent injection for all 5 units, if MISO wanted us to maintain all 5 of the units. And then as Gale mentioned just now and in the script, our expectation would be that those dollars would be recovered in a system support resource agreement with MISO.","Paul Zimbardo - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division","Okay. So a total of $6 million to $12 million for all of the units [ph]?","Allen L. Leverett","Yes. So if we had to put DSI, if they wanted us to maintain all 5, $6 million to $12 million for all 5, Julien (sic) [Paul].","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","Well, I was going to have -- the first question is, how many points are you going to give me on that Green Baby?","Gale E. Klappa","We'll negotiate.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc., Research Division","My second question is, when we think about your long-term articulated earnings growth aspiration, Gale, should we still be thinking about it off of the original guidance? Or should we be basing our expectations off of the new guidance, taking into account the weather and the accounting -- the treasury grant and those other items?","Gale E. Klappa","On the 4 to 6? Okay. Well, really, Greg, as you know, the weather can move us in one direction or another pretty quickly. So I would suggest you maintain your look in terms of the longer-term growth rate of our normal guidance of 4% to 6% -- or of our guidance of 4% to 6% EPS growth based on normal weather.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","I'm just curious, on the increased guidance, is it all weather related? Or is it also a piece of -- a component of that is how that weather-normalized sales are tracking ahead of your expectations?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, first, I'd like to know what you did with Pat at that dinner. But anyway, you're talking about our revised guidance for the remainder of 2014?","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Correct.","Gale E. Klappa","Basically, what we've done is taken into account some impact from the weather. On the other hand, we know we're going to see some additional operation and maintenance expenses, gas leak inspections and other distribution network work that has got to be carried on is going to raise our O&M some going forward. So in essence, what we've done is tempered our look at Q1, knowing that there are going to be some additional O&M coming down the pike and raise our guidance slightly as you saw. So basically, weather-driven offset by what we know is going to be some higher O&M. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes","Gale, I think that you nailed it. I think that's the main points, Brian.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. And I think your long-term weather-normalized sales forecast is 0.7%. Should we bump that up to what we've seen in the first quarter? Or is it still too early for that?","Gale E. Klappa","Way too early for that, Brian. As you know, the weather normalization techniques in our industry tend to fall apart or tend to be less accurate when you get into the tail, when you get beyond 2 standard deviations. And I think with this weather in the first quarter, we were like 8 standard deviations away from norm. So I wouldn't read too much into weather normalization for Q1, and I think our roughly 0.5% projection for the normal growth is still pretty accurate.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then do you plan on issuing any debt at the utility in 2014?","Gale E. Klappa","We will ask Mr. -- we do have some maturities, but in fact one where we had a bond offering just matured, so we do have some plans.","James Patrick Keyes","Yes, Brian, we got a couple of things coming. At Wisconsin Electric, the WEPCo side, we had a bond mature last month. So I would say -- and that was about $300 million, I would say some time in the second quarter, we're optimistic it might go a little later, but let's just say second quarter, we'll probably do something around that size. And then you may recall that last year, we had a bond mature at Wisconsin Gas, I think that was $45 million, $50 million in that zip code. We've been able to manage that but we anticipate that some time, probably the third quarter, in the neighborhood of $100 million, we will probably do something at Wisconsin Gas this year at well -- as well, excuse me.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay, great. And then just lastly, the fuel costs and the 2% dead band, where did you guys end up at the end of the quarter?","Gale E. Klappa","At the end of the quarter, we're above the dead band.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. Inc., Research Division","Okay. I would just imagine the off-system sales are helping to support that.","Gale E. Klappa","No question about that, absolutely. In fact, as you probably heard me say in the script, our off-system sales were up 157%. I mean, really, our units, I'm very pleased with how our units performed. And the Valley of our new Oak Creek units was absolutely completely visible during Q1. And MISO asked those units to run at the top virtually every single day of Q1.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Remind me, filing rate cases in Wisconsin, do you -- the test year, is it a forward or backward test year? And does weather get adjusted out?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, as you may recall, Kit, and then you look at 50 different states, so it's hard to recall specifically, they're one of the few in the country with a 2-year forward-looking test year. So what we are doing now in finalizing all of the data, we will be looking at and filing our projected investment and our projected expenses for the years 2015 and 2016. So that is basically the standard approach in Wisconsin. I think it's a constructive approach because you're not actually looking back with a lot of lag. You're actually projecting your appropriate expenses for the following 2 years.","Kit Konolige - BGC Partners, Inc., Research Division","Yes, absolutely. And what is your early -- last go-round, the ROE was not a topic for discussion in the rate case. Is that likely to be repeated? Or should we have a fully litigated situation where ROE is kind of in its traditional central place in a rate case?","Gale E. Klappa","Good question, very good question. And let me just say this. There are a lot of discussions going on. Alliant, one of our sister utilities here in Wisconsin, has just entered into a settlement. Now they're, because of a particular situation they have, they're able to keep rates flat for a couple of years. But there, they and the intervenor groups and the commission staff appear to have agreed on a, in essence, setting rates for the electric utility at a 10.2% return. So I think that may be indicative -- we're having some discussions as well about ROE and capital structure. But I would not expect significant change, particularly in light of the first step forward between Alliant and the intervenor groups.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Two questions. One, pretty easy. Can you walk us through -- you mentioned a lot of different items, a lot of different projects and the potential capital costs, including the environmental pollution control equipment at Presque Isle. Is any of that not in your current CapEx guidance that you guys have given out over the last couple of months and put in your 10-K and other data?","Gale E. Klappa","Michael, good question. Virtually everything we discussed is in our -- it's like Ragu, it's in there. But we should be very clear about the capital cost that Allen talked about related to Presque Isle, a potential capital cost related to Presque Isle. Those would be costs that we would expect because of the need for those units for reliability to be reimbursed. So I really wouldn't look at that as part of our announced capital budget.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And I apologize, I missed Allen's comments about the level or extent of that capital spend on Presque Isle.","Gale E. Klappa","Allen, would you like to repeat?","Allen L. Leverett","No, what we said before, Michael, was that it was likely to be $6 million to $12 million. We're doing some testing this summer and so we'll be able to nail down where we're going to be in the range. And that would be for dry sorbent injection. And so that would assume we do all 5 units. If for some reason MISO didn't want all 5 units, well, that $6 million to $12 million range would go down somewhat, Michael, but that's for 5 units.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Okay. And Allen, as long as I've got you, can you give an update a little bit on ATC's rate base growth expectation and ATC growth opportunities outside of the state of Wisconsin?","Allen L. Leverett","Yes. Well, as we talked a little bit on the -- on our year-end call about ATC's capital budget and for the next 3 years, their capital budget inside the footprint, so this would be for calendar years '14, '15, '16, would be $1.3 billion. So that's unchanged from the estimates that we talked about on our last earnings call. So at that level of spending, when you sort of translate that into net income growth at ATC, Michael, that certainly fully supports the 4% to 6% target that Gale and, I think, Greg Gordon were talking about earlier. In terms of opportunities outside the footprint, the $1.3 billion that I talked about for '14, '15, '16 combined, that doesn't include anything outside the footprint at all. ATC is certainly pursuing things elsewhere in the MISO footprint, pursuing things in the western part of the country. But at this point, Michael, I would not expect any of those investments to materialize, or at least for us to actually employ capital for some of those investments until, say, the '17, '18, '19 timeframe. So I wouldn't put any of those opportunities in sort of the next 36 months or so. They're going to be out a bit. But even without those, they still got a lot of good growth over the next 3 years, even without those opportunities.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division","Got it. And last question, I'll add one on here real quick. Gale, natural gas demand, do you think -- I mean, we're now several quarters for you guys. I mean, if I go back, it's really 3 or 4, 4 or 5 quarters now. Do you think we're seeing a structural shift in what is weather-normalized natural gas demand? And if so, what do you think the new level is? I mean, historically, natural gas demand had been on a long-term downward slope for 15 to 20 years. And I wonder if something's happened that's not weather related but structural that's changing what weather-normalized gas demand is.","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I understand your wife likes it hotter, but other than that, Michael, I think that, and not in any way trying to avoid the question, but trying to be absolutely brutally frank with you, the weather has been so abnormal, in particular what we've seen in Q1, that I think we're going to need another year or 2 before we can really determine whether there's any structural change going on here. On the one hand, you see data that indicates that maybe there is a structural change but then on the other hand, gas prices are now higher than they've been in a while. Natural gas prices are now higher than they've been in a while. Last time I looked, at about $4.80 per million BTU. Furnaces, new furnaces are still much more efficient, let's say, a 10- or 15-year-old furnace. There are a lot of competing factors going on here. I think it's going to take a little bit longer before we can really understand if there is any kind of structural change that would reverse the pattern of the past 20 years.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Jim von Riesemann with CRT Capital.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","One follow-up to Greg Gordon's question, this 4% to 6% growth. I was a little unclear as to whether or not the base year had been shifted around a little bit.","Gale E. Klappa","No, the base year has not shifted. We will take a look, as we enter 2015, about shifting the base year. But right now, the base year stays in place.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","So that's 2011, just to confirm.","Gale E. Klappa","You're absolutely correct.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. Second question is my standard capital allocation question. But this time, I have a twist.","Gale E. Klappa","A twist? All right.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","Okay. So you know I'm not a fan of you guys buying back stock better than 2x book. But it seems to me that if I did the math correctly, you bought 426,000 shares in the first quarter, and if I just take a simple arithmetic average between year-end price and the March end prize, you're buying back stock in the $44 a share range or $18 million with the stock. And if you've got a new $300 million program in place annualized at $100 million a year, that should be $25 million a quarter. Am I reading anything into the fact that this is now down on what an annualized run rate would be and that you're starting to shy away from buying back stock at these levels?","Gale E. Klappa","I've heard the rumor that you're not a fan of buying back stock at 2x books, so I'm glad you admitted this.","James D. von Riesemann - CRT Capital Group LLC, Research Division","In fact, even in print.","Gale E. Klappa","I know, exactly. But we can't read everything you see in print, or you can't believe everything you see in print. I'm just giving you a hard time. First of all, one of the things that -- one of our guiding principles has been that as we have positive cash flow materialize, that if we don't have other investment opportunities on the near-term horizon for the use of that cash, then one of our philosophies is, we don't think our shareholders will reward us for just building up cash on the balance sheet. So that's one of our other guiding principles here and I would not read anything into our first quarter activity other than we tend to look at it quarter by quarter as we have cash building up.","Operator","Your next question comes from line of Andy Bischof with Morningstar Research.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Quick question. Any idea on the potential cost of the Oak Creek fuel flexibility program? Or are we still too early in the stages?","Gale E. Klappa","Too early, but we've put a bookend around it, again, depending upon the specific equipment modifications that might be needed. Our bookends, and we'll know a lot more later this year, are at a low end, maybe $25 million, $30 million; at the high end, maybe $100 million.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Great. And then just trying to get a handle on around the growth opportunity for propane customers switching to gas. Can you provide a little more color on the extent of the growth opportunity here and kind of what is the penetration level of current customers so far?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, I will say this. In terms of propane consumption, just pure propane consumption, Wisconsin is one of the top 5 states in the country. So I think that gives you a sense of the potential conversion opportunity here. And as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, even in Q1, which was a pretty brutal time to try to switch furnaces, we saw a 7% increase so far this year in new customer connections to our natural gas network compared to a year ago. So I honestly think the conversion opportunity, particularly in light of what happened to propane pricing, but even more so the severe shortages of propane this past winter, I think the conversion opportunity is perhaps even greater than we thought.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Bill Appicelli with Nexus.","Bill Appicelli","Just had a follow-up on the Presque Isle issue. I believe you guys have a -- there's an open doc at FERC related to this issue and I was just wondering if you guys could sort of remind me of what your position is or what's trying to be accomplished there?","Gale E. Klappa","I'll let Allen give you the details. The open docket at FERC is really about cost allocations. In other words, we have an agreement with MISO on payment of about $52 million for the next 12 months to compensate us for maintaining and operating those units. And then the open docket really relates, as we understand it, to who has to pay MISO for that $52 million. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett","No, that's right. I wouldn't add anything to that.","Gale E. Klappa","Okay.","Bill Appicelli","Okay. And do you guys have any sense of the timing of that or how that would impact, I guess, some of these other decisions you guys were talking about earlier?","Allen L. Leverett","Well, the SSR agreement is for 1 year. So it goes from, I think, February 1 of this year to February 1 of next year, and I think MISO has like a 3-month extension option. So if they want us to continue to operate the plant after that, and I expect they will, we'll have to do another SSR agreement. But I would expect, given FERC, they went ahead and let us start -- MISO start charging and MISO start paying us. So I don't really think the fact that there's a review going on at FERC is going to affect any of that. It might take a number of months. We might be to the end of the year before they resolve the allocation question that Gale talked about. But it's not really going to impact our ability to collect dollars from MISO at all. So it's really not an issue for us as we would see it.","Bill Appicelli","Okay. But is it an allocation between Michigan and Wisconsin?","Allen L. Leverett","Well, it's an issue about interstate, so allocation between the states. And to a certain degree, you'll also get into some allocation issues within Wisconsin. So it's a fairly complicated question about how these costs are ultimately allocated.","Gale E. Klappa","In essence, the issue is that in other parts of MISO, these kinds of costs are allocated in a certain way, but within the ATC footprint, they're allocated in a separate way. And the Wisconsin Commission's view is that the allocation that affects -- the allocation in effect, if you were inside the ATC footprint, is punitive to Wisconsin, and that's really the issue.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Vedula Murti with CDP.","Vedula Murti","So all of my questions are actually asked and answered.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andy Levi with Avon Capital Advisors.","Andrew Levi","Just on Bill's question, did the state of Wisconsin intervene on this case?","Allen L. Leverett","In the FERC proceeding, Andy, yes, they did.","Andrew Levi","And what's their issue?","Allen L. Leverett","When you said the state of Wisconsin, the public [indiscernible]. Their issue is allocation. They don't believe that the MISO tariff, as currently structured, provides for a fair allocation as between Wisconsin and Michigan. So that's really their issue. Their issue is not the total cost, it's the allocation of the cost.","Gale E. Klappa","In fact, Allen's right, Andy. In fact, in their intervention asking FERC to provide for a different allocation between Wisconsin and Michigan, they actually said that they believe we should be compensated in the way we're being compensated. It's just who has to make that compensation, how much to Michigan, how much to Wisconsin, is the issue.","Andrew Levi","And what's the breakdown now?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, now, it's close to 90-10. In other words, 90% of these SSR payments will be billed to Wisconsin customers and about 10% to Michigan and that is what has the Wisconsin Commission concerned. They think that that's not a proper allocation, that much more of the cost should go to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.","Andrew Levi","Okay. But it's not a situation where if FERC rules against them, they don't -- they come after you or anything like that?","Gale E. Klappa","No. As Allen said earlier, we don't think this has any impact on the agreement itself and on our -- and on the payments to us for operating the unit. It's just a matter of how is the pie sliced among parties that have to pay MISO for this benefit.","Andrew Levi","Right, right. So it's really the PFC fighting FERC, not [ph] fighting you guys?","Gale E. Klappa","You could look at it that way. I think what the PFC and Wisconsin...","Andrew Levi","Or MISO or however you want to look at it.","Gale E. Klappa","Exactly. Really trying to get the MISO tariff or this part of MISO to match up with the rest of MISO because it's different here that -- just the way the cost allocation works. If you're inside the American Transmission Company footprint, that cost allocation is different than all the rest of MISO, and the Wisconsin Commission is saying it needs to be all the same.","Andrew Levi","Okay. And then another question. It's the one I think Jim was going to ask. I'm just guessing, but I did want to ask, so I'll ask the question. There's an article earlier in the year...","Gale E. Klappa","Is he under the desk, Andy?","Andrew Levi","I'm sorry. No, I'm just guessing and I might be wrong, I shouldn't speak for Jim. But there was an article earlier in the year, Bloomberg article relating to you and M&A. And you were name with a myriad of other companies relative to Berkshire Hathaway, and I was just wondering if you want to address that or not.","Gale E. Klappa","Andy, as you know, that article, in all likelihood, was based on pure speculation, and over the years, we found it not very productive to comment on speculation. All right. Well, ladies and gentlemen, that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. If you have any other questions, Colleen Henderson will be available at our Investor Relations office, and her direct line is (414) 221-2592. Thanks, again, everybody.

Thank you for waiting and welcome to WEC Energy Group's Conference Call to review the 2015 Year-End Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statement, factors described in WEC Energy Group's and Integrys Holding's latest Form 10-Ks and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, WEC has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wecenergygroup.com. A replay of our remarks will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Helane, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thank you for joining us today as we review our results for calendar year 2015. As you know, we formed WEC Energy Group on June 29 when we closed our acquisition of Integrys. So today's report reflects two full quarters as a combined company. I'll update our progress on a number of major initiatives in just a moment.","But first, as always, I'd like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of WEC Energy Group and CEO-elect; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; Scott Lauber, Treasurer; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Turning now to our 2015 performance, I'd like to remind you that we're focusing on legacy Wisconsin Energy so our financial results have been adjusted to remove the impact of the acquisition. And as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported Wisconsin Energy adjusted standalone earnings of $2.73 a share for 2015, that compares with adjusted earnings of $2.65 a share for 2014.","Looking back over the latest year, it was not only a transformational year for our company but a year also of significant achievements. We Energies was named the most reliable utility in the Midwest for the fifth consecutive year. In international studies, We Energies ranked in the top quartile in the Midwest again for customer service and power quality and in the top quartile nationally for customer service. In addition, Wisconsin Public Service in Green Bay was ranked number two in the Midwest for overall customer satisfaction among mid-sized utilities.","We also reached a milestone for employee safety at We Energies, recording the safest year in more than 115 years of operation. We invested nearly $780 million in our legacy core business with all major projects on time and on budget. And, of course, we closed our acquisition of Integrys to form WEC Energy Group, the leading electric and natural gas utility system in the Midwest with now 4.4 million customers across the region.","From a financial standpoint, we continued to deliver solid earnings growth. Through disciplined cost control and effective planning, we delivered record earnings in 2015 despite a very warm fourth quarter. In fact, Milwaukee experienced the warmest December in its history, surpassing the former record set way back in the day in 1877.","Taking a look at the state's economy, Wisconsin's unemployment rate ended the year at 4.3%, well below the national average and the December statistics show that more Wisconsinites were employed than during any other month in history. The state's labor force participation rate also rose to 68%, which is more than 5 points better than the national rates. In addition, Wisconsin added 4,000 manufacturing jobs from November 2014 to November of 2015 despite some very challenging conditions for manufacturers.","In light of these challenges, use of electricity by our large commercial and industrial customers moderated a bit. In 2015, our large customers, excluding the iron ore mines, consumed approximately 0.4% less electricity than they did in 2014. However, and this is an important point, we did see improvement in several significant sectors of the state's economy including food processing, printing, paper production and plastics.","In addition, we continued to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. We Energies is serving approximately 6,500 more electric customers and more than 8,500 more customers on the gas side of our business today than we were a year ago.","I'm also pleased with our post-acquisition work over the past several months as we've begun to operationalize the new WEC Energy Group. As I've said before, we see tremendous opportunity in the framework of the new company. WEC Energy Group has the scale, scope, technical depth, geographic reach, and financial resources to thrive in our consolidating industry. We're leveraging these strengths to deliver operational and financial benefits to all of our stakeholders. And with our proven leadership team, we're incorporating best practices across the organization to streamline our operations and to reduce costs.","WEC Energy Group is now the eighth largest natural gas distribution company in the country and one of the 15 largest investor-owned utility systems in the United States with real opportunity for growth.","Bottom line, we have the same top management team, but now with a new platform for growth, a platform focused on the energy infrastructure needs of 4.4 million customers across the Midwest and our plan calls for the combined company to grow earnings per share by 6% to 8% in 2016.","Now, I'd like to spend a few minutes reviewing the impact of bonus depreciation, a subject I know you're very interested in. As you know, in December, Congress passed a tax law that extends and modifies bonus depreciation for property placed in service from 2015 to 2019. At this point, we estimate that we'll receive approximately $1 billion of cash benefits from this extension of bonus depreciation, with most of the benefits coming in 2016 and in 2017. First, let me say though, that we do not expect bonus depreciation to have any material impact on earnings this year. And over the longer term we have significant flexibility to bring forward reliability projects that will clearly benefit customers.","The additional cash benefits will allow us to fund a strong backlog of infrastructure investments that the region needs for reliability. And if the Clean Power plan moves forward on the proposed timetable, our incremental cash flows could well be needed to support additional investments in renewable energy or new natural gas generation for our fleet.","Of course, we also have the option to further deleverage the holding company. So bottom line, for the longer term, beyond 2016, we continue to see earnings per share growth of 5% to 7% a year. As a reminder, our current 10-year investment plan is primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We expect that more than half of our capital investments, about $800 million a year roughly, will be dedicated to the gas delivery business, providing safer and more reliable infrastructure and extending our gas distribution lines to customers across the Midwest.","We also plan to invest approximately $400 million a year to upgrade and harden our electric delivery networks. Now, the primary risks associated with these core distribution projects are naturally more manageable given the smaller scale and scope of the work. But the work is no less important than the mega projects we've completed over the years. Our focus now on renewing our distribution networks is essential to maintaining our status as one of the nation's most reliable utilities.","We also expect the remaining investment, approximately $300 million a year, will be focused on our generating fleet and on what we call corporate infrastructure. To be clear, however, these projections did not include any capital that would be needed for compliance with the Clean Power Plan.","Turning now to other developments, I'm pleased to report that the conversion of the Valley Power Plant near Downtown Milwaukee from coal to natural gas was completed in the fourth quarter on time and on budget. The total investment was approximately $60 million, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","We're also making very good progress on the major construction work at our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. After more than 100 years of operation we're building a new powerhouse and adding spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Overall, the Twin Falls project is on time and on budget with approximately 82% of the construction now complete. We're targeting commercial operation for the summer of this year, and we're forecasting a total investment of $60 million to $65 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Next, you may recall that we're working to add fuel flexibilities at our Oak Creek expansion units. These units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. But given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save customers anywhere between $25 million and $50 million a year, depending upon the mix. Work is under way now to expand our coal storage capability at the Oak Creek site. The larger site should be ready by early next year.","Also, the first capital investment inside the plant was made on one of the units during a planned outage this past fall. We also plan to upgrade the second unit during the first quarter of this year. Our share of these investments for the new Oak Creek units is targeted at approximately $80 million, again, excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","We're also moving forward on the Accelerated Main Replacement Program at Peoples Gas in Chicago. As you'll recall, this is one of the largest natural gas infrastructure projects in the country. The program calls for the replacement of approximately 2,000 miles of Chicago's aging gas pipelines and I'm pleased to report that over the past six months, we've taken significant steps to improve the management and performance of this project, which is now approximately 18% complete. We engaged a nationally recognized engineering firm that helped us conduct an extensive independent review of the work plan and the long-term cost estimates.","And as part of our fresh start in Chicago, we filed a plan on November 30 that lays out our top priorities for the next three years. The components of the three-year plan include removal and replacement of more than 250 miles of aging cast iron pipes in the neighborhoods most at risk, a projected investment of between $250 million and $280 million a year, and regular updates to the Illinois Commerce Commission and other stakeholders to keep them fully informed of our progress.","In assessing the plan that we filed on November 30, the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled a series of six workshops to be held by the end of March. Two of the workshops are already complete. While the engineering, fieldwork and cost recovery continue, these workshops are bringing together all of the stakeholders to review the scope, the schedule and the long-term cost of the plan with a focus on safety and reliability. I'm confident that the steps we're taking will provide Chicagoans with a safe modern natural gas delivery system that they deserve.","Moving now to our transmission business, our electric transmission business, as you know, WEC is now a 60% owner of American Transmission Company. ATC's capital plan calls for investment of $3.7 billion to $4.5 billion between now and 2024 to bolster the reliability of the grid. As I've said in the past, we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business.","Turning now to our dividend policy, on January 21, as you may have read, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.495 a share, an increase of 8.2% over the previous quarterly dividend. Our annual dividend rate is now $1.98 a share. Going forward, we're targeting a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings and we expect our dividend growth to be in line with the growth in earnings per share.","On a final note, as I mentioned on one of our previous calls, we've been seeking a new owner for the Trillium compressed natural gas business. You'll recall that this business came to us as part of the Integrys transaction. We sold part of the business in late November of last year, and very recently, we reached an agreement to sell substantially all of the remaining Trillium assets. This agreement is subject to Hart-Scott-Rodino review and we're projecting to reach financial close by the end of the first quarter.","In total, we expect at least $130 million of pre-tax cash proceeds from the combined sales of the Trillium assets. The fair value of Trillium was reflected in our purchase price allocation following the Integrys acquisition and as you know, the earnings on the Trillium business were not significant to our company.","So, in summary, ladies and gentlemen, these are exciting times filled with opportunity and change for our company. And speaking of change, we recently announced that I'll be retiring as Chief Executive Officer effective May 1. After May 1, I'll continue to serve the company as the Non-Executive Chairman of the Board and I'm delighted that Allen Leverett will succeed me as Chief Executive. Allen has also been appointed to our board of directors.","As most of you know, Allen has been a very key contributor to our success since he joined Wisconsin Energy the same year I did back in 2003, first as Chief Financial Officer, then as the leader of our power generation group and most recently as President of the parent firm at our Wisconsin, Minnesota and Michigan utilities. I've known and worked with Allen for more than 20 years.","Now, I have to tell you he is not quite as fond of breed of financial audit as I am, but the depth of his experience, his management skills and his focus on execution make him the ideal person to lead our company through a time of continuing change in the energy industry. Allen, my congratulations.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Thank you, Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And now for more details on our 2015 performance and our outlook for 2016, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, in 2015, our adjusted earnings grew to $2.73 compared with $2.65 a share for 2014. Our adjusted earnings exclude the Integrys company's earnings and the impacts of the acquisition. They are also adjusted for the shares issued in connection with the merger.","To facilitate comparisons with last year, my discussion of 2015 results will focus primarily on legacy Wisconsin Energy. The earnings packet placed on our website this morning includes the results of the Integrys companies and has a full GAAP to adjusted reconciliation.","First, I'll focus on operating income for Wisconsin Energy and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes. Our consolidated operating income for the full year 2015 was $1.137 billion as compared with $1.125 billion in 2014. That's an increase of $12 million.","Starting with the Utility Energy segment, the operating income in 2015 totaled $767.7 million, an increase of $3.5 million over 2014. On the positive side, we had a $35 million increase in revenues due to the Wisconsin rate order. We also had $10.4 million of improved fuel recoveries and lower O&M cost, in part driven by lower benefits cost and reduced maintenance expense in the fourth quarter, decreased expenses by $10.2 million.","On the downside, we estimate that our electric and gas margins decrease by $35.3 million, driven by warmer fourth quarter weather. The fourth quarter of 2015 was the second warmest in the history of We Energies.","In addition, depreciation expense rose by $16.8 million with additional capital expenditures. Combining these and other factors results in a $3.5 million increase in adjusted Utility operating income in 2015 as compared with 2014.","Our Non-Utility Energy operating income was $373.4 million, which is $5.4 million higher than the prior year due to additional investment in our Oak Creek expansion units. Our Corporate and Other segment showed an operating loss of $4.5 million, essentially flat with the prior year. Taking the changes for these segments together, you'd arrive at $12 million increase in adjusted operating income.","During 2015, earnings from Wisconsin Energy's investment in American Transmission Company totaled $54.5 million, which was an $11.5 million decline from 2014. As we previously mentioned, ATC has established reserves in light of recent appeals to the FERC regarding authorized returns for regional transmission organizations. ATC re-evaluated those reserves in the fourth quarter and decided to increase them.","Other income net increased by $24.3 million, driven in large part by second quarter asset sales. Higher AFUDC, driven primarily by our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin, also contributed.","2015 net interest expense increased by $2 million. This was driven by slightly higher long-term debt, offset somewhat by lower interest rates. Wisconsin Energy's standalone income tax expense rose by $2.7 million for 2015. Our higher taxable income was slightly offset by a lower effective tax rate. Looking forward, we expect WEC Energy Group's effective income tax rate to be between 37.5% and 38.5% for 2016. Combining all of these items brings you to adjusted net income of $620.9 million or $2.73 per share for 2015.","Turning now to operating cash flows. We have provided information in your earnings packet for the consolidated WEC Energy Group on a GAAP basis, which includes six months results from Integrys. We believe this will be a more accurate indicator of the cash position of the company. During 2015, WEC Energy Group's operating cash flow totaled $1.294 billion, which is a $95 million improvement over 2014. A major driver of the improvement was the inclusion of legacy Integrys companies for six months, which added both to depreciation and deferred income taxes. Legacy Wisconsin Energy's year-to-date operating cash flows in 2015 were about $41 million lower as compared to 2014. As previously discussed, we contributed $100 million to our pension plans in 2015. No such contributions were made during 2014.","Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.4% at the end of 2015. This ratio reflects the Integrys acquisition and treats half of WEC Energy Group's hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options, and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","For comparison purposes, the annual sales information I'll discuss next will reflect results for We Energies only. Actual 2015 retail deliveries fell by 1.8%. Excluding the iron ore mines, retail deliveries fell by 0.8%. Weather-normalized retail deliveries, again excluding the iron ore mines, also fell by 0.8% compared to 2014.","Looking at the individual customer segments now, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries fall by 1.8%. Actual residential deliveries fell by 2%. Across our small commercial and industrial group, weather-normal deliveries rose by 0.2%. Actual deliveries fell by 0.1%. In the large commercial and industrial segment, deliveries for 2015 fell by 3.1%. Excluding the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.4%.","Our 2015 weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, dropped 1.5% compared to 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again, excluding gas used for power generation, were down 11% compared to the polar vortex-driven gas sales in 2014.","For 2016, we will forecast and discuss delivery results for the State of Wisconsin, our largest segment. Our Wisconsin segment includes the results of both We Energies and Wisconsin Public Service. Note that, with decoupling, gas deliveries in Illinois are not as tightly tied to financial results.","So in Wisconsin, we're forecasting a modest increase of 0.3% in weather-normalized retail electric deliveries excluding the iron ore mines. That compares to a 0.1% decline in 2015. We plan to meet our earnings targets without relying on any significant gains in energy usage by our customers.","Looking at 2016 by individual customer segments, we expect residential deliveries to decline by 0.1%, impacted positively by continued modest growth in housing starts, but offset by conservation. In the small commercial and industrial segment, we are projecting sales to decline by 0.3%. And in the large commercial and industrial group, we are projecting an increase of 1.2%, excluding the mines. We project 2016 Wisconsin weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, to increase by 0.5%.","Turning now to our capital forecast. As Gale mentioned, we expect to invest at least $1.5 billion per year in capital projects, or $15 billion in the next decade. Correspondingly, we plan to invest $1.5 billion in 2016, primarily focused on modernizing our delivery networks. We will continue to evaluate both our short-term and long-term capital investment plans in light of bonus depreciation.","Next, I'd like to remind you about earnings guidance for 2016. As previously mentioned, we expect earnings per share growth for WEC Energy Group to be in a range of 6% to 8% off a base of $2.72 a share. Therefore, our guidance for 2016 is in a range from $2.88 to $2.94 a share. This projection assumes normal weather and excludes any potential remaining acquisition-related costs. Again, our guidance for 2016 is $2.88 to $2.94 per share.","Finally, let's look at first quarter guidance. Taking into account January weather and the timing of fuel recoveries, we project first quarter earnings to be in a range of $0.99 to $1.03 per share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes any remaining acquisition-related costs. Once again, first quarter guidance for the WEC Energy Group is $0.99 to $1.03 per share.","And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Pat, thank you very much. Overall, we're suddenly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our shareholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And now, we would like to take the questions. Your first question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Afternoon, Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hey. Good afternoon and congratulations to both of you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you very much.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Thank you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Absolutely. So perhaps just...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","(26:12), Julien.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Absolutely. Thank you. Kicking it off here, I'd just be curious, Peoples Gas, just the earned ROEs and expectations into 2016, looks like there could be a nice pick-up there. But I'd be curious if you can elaborate kind of what you're thinking about an earned ROE embedded in that range.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Or what should we be thinking about for that segment?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I am really glad you asked, Julien. Let me first say that for calendar year 2015, the Illinois utilities, Peoples Gas and North Shore, earned their allowed rate of return, which is 9.05% (26.54) and that's exactly what's embedded in our forecast for 2016 earnings guidance. I know you had...","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","All right.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","...questions about whether we could achieve that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","No, well, there we go. And then secondly, I'd just be curious, in terms of the bonus depreciation, if you can elaborate a little further there. Can you discuss a little bit more what the offsets were for 2016 and how you were able to entirely offset it? And then looking forward a little bit more prospectively here, could you talk about what there too, what are the items adding up in terms of added spend, et cetera, to make it up?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me try to frame that for you, and if any of our guys want to add additional detail, feel free to do so. But for 2016, since there will be no \u2013 basically, there will be no base rate changes for calendar 2016 across our major utilities. We really don't see any immediate type of a hit in terms of bonus depreciation. However, in terms of the cash that we'll be receiving, it has allowed us to pull forward several important infrastructure projects. Really it's not large projects, but it's things like replacement of additional underground lines, substation transformer replacements, et cetera. Virtually all of that is in Wisconsin and that's worth about an additional $100 million that we've identified so far for 2016 just as an example.","So I think most of the projects that we are looking at that will be able to be funded with the bonus depreciation cash are exactly those types of projects; on our gas delivery networks and on our electric delivery networks, all related to reliability, all related to upgrading, modernizing and hardening for safety purposes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Great, excellent. And then last, just follow-up there if you can, thinking big picture CPP longer term, we've heard a lot of other states talk a lot about adjacencies to Canada and imports. Can you talk a little bit more about the Manitoba Hydro opportunity in the long term and how that fits into your five-year and 10-year CapEx plan?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it really has no impact on the 5-year CapEx plan or really nothing specific in the 10-year CapEx plan. However, and I'll ask Allen to talk about this, if there are going to be more hydro imports from Canada, there clearly would have to be additional transmission built. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Yeah. So, of course, the Manitoba Hydro, we wouldn't actually be an investor, we will be an offtaker of the power. So in terms of a direct investment, we wouldn't have any direct investment in the hydro units themselves. But as Gale mentioned, if you're going to have deliverability and actually be able to affect the generation dispatch in Wisconsin, you'd have to be able to deliver it, so you'd need the electric transmission. But at this point, we certainly don't have a number on what that investment might look like.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Still a bit early. But it is something indeed that you're interested in exploring, correct?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Absolutely.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Yeah. I mean, I think it's something \u2013 another item in the toolbox that would help us potentially with compliance.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And to Allen's point, Julien, if we're facing, as a state, in Wisconsin a 41% reduction in CO2 emissions, we're going to need every cost-effective tool we have.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Yeah. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome. Thank you, Julien. Appreciate it.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Jim von Riesemann with Mizuho. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Rock and roll, Jim. How are you?","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Meet the new boss, same as the old boss.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","But without Mexican food.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Without Mexican food. Well, you know...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","It may change a little bit, Jim.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","So not to quote The Who or anything, but the question really is for Allen. So how would you describe your management style versus Gale's? And what would you say are the nuances in your respective strategic visions for WEC going forward?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Oh, man, this is going to be interesting.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Well, Jim, that's such a long...","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Has your post been paid yet, Allen?","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","That's such a long question; I'm going to give you a very short answer. And it's probably easier for me to talk about what won't change, Jim.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","And we talked about a lot of things that will, and Mexican food \u2013 no Mexican food at the staff meetings. But what won't change is really a focus on execution and delivering results. So that's a short answer to your very long conceptual question.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","But that's what won't change.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Let me ask you a second broad topic before I go into a modeling or two question. With respect to growth, what we've seen over the last several weeks from the companies that have been reporting is that not all G is created equal. Can you talk about why your G is standing out and why you're so confident in your 5% to 7% longer term growth rate?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I'll take a shot at it. Allen certainly should offer his view. I think the reason we're confident in our 6% to 8% growth in 2016 and then 5% to 7% afterward is essentially the need for the significant capital investments in the kinds of projects that we have embedded in that 10-year plan. Our huge generation projects are behind us by and large. But the kind of reliability upgrades, the kind of modernization that's needed on the natural gas delivery networks and the electric delivery networks, those are essential for reliability going forward. And when we see the significant backlog that we have and, of course, our capital spending doubling with the acquisition of Integrys compared to standalone Wisconsin Energy, the need and the backlog of the projects gives me, at least, very significant confidence in our ability to hit the growth rates. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Yeah. I guess the only thing I would add, Jim, to Gale's comment, quite a bit of the investment we're looking at is in the natural gas side of the business. So there is a clear need from an infrastructure standpoint. So I think that's something else that you should keep in mind when you look at the longer-term numbers.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And to Allen's point, Jim, it's not just Chicago. We have a significant amount of natural gas delivery network investment in Wisconsin as well. And for that matter, expansions in Minnesota, in Rochester, growth in Michigan with the natural gas utility there. So I think we said earlier that about $800 million a year on average of our $1.5 billion of capital investment will be devoted toward the natural gas delivery business.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Switching over to a couple financial questions, can you talk broadly about your financing plans for 2016 and 2017 in terms of expected debt issuances, maybe on a net basis? And then talk about your free cash flow expectations over the same period with free cash flow being defined both pre and post dividend?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. We'll let Pat and Scott talk with you specifically. I will say that right now the first thing we have out of the box in 2016, and we announced it earlier this week, is a tender offer for the hybrids or a portion of the hybrids that were outstanding at TEG. It's one of the issues of the hybrids that we have a tender offer for right now. So that's the first refinancing or the first financing opportunity that we have that's underway right now. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. And them Jim, in 2016, this is actually a pretty light year for us. We only project right now to have two bond offerings, one in Wisconsin Gas probably in the first half of the year, and then at PGL in the second half of the year. So this is \u2013 certainly relative to last year, not a lot going on.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Let me be a bit more straightforward. Do you expect to be free cash flow positive this year, next year?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","No, we do not. We do not expect to be free cash flow positive this year or next year.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","What's the delta versus being free cash?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","I don't have that number at my fingertips, but part of what Gale said is we're evaluating, and my comments as well, as we evaluate the capital plan, even if I had that number, that would be a little bit in flux as we evaluate how to deploy that bonus depreciation cash we've received. So we can follow up when we kind of frame that up in a little more detail, if you'd like, but I'd rather not wallow around in it, if that's all right.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And Jim, an additional comment on that. Remember, we do not have any need to issue additional equity. So basically, we might be talking about a slight increase in commercial paper or one of these bond offerings that Pat laid out. But we're within the \u2013 I mean, we're basically within the confines of not needing additional equity and maintaining the current type of debt to capital that we've been historically maintaining.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Okay. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, Jim. Thanks for the comments.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Greetings, Michael. How are you today?","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I'm well. Congrats to both of you, gentlemen.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","A couple of just questions, I want to make sure \u2013 I hopped on a tad bit late, so I want to make sure I understand. You've got your rate case filing coming in Wisconsin in the next couple of months, April-May timeframe I think. Should we imply that given the fact you have extra capital as part of bonus depreciation that the CapEx requirements or the CapEx spends for kind of the two-year period that case will cover, 2017 and 2018, potentially higher than what you kind of disclosed in the EEI-related slide decks given the fact you have a lot more capital available to you at that subsidiary \u2013 or at those subsidiaries?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think certainly because we now have the availability of additional cash through the federal government's extension of bonus depreciation, I mean, yes, we are looking at for the benefit of customers to be able to invest in more modernization than what you saw in our slide deck in terms of the 10-year capital plan. Because as you'll recall, we did not take for granted that there would be an extension of bonus depreciation when we laid out the new 10-year capital plan at the EEI Conference in November. So yes, I think you could expect us to have additional capital investment, again, along the lines of additional upgrading of our natural gas and electricity delivery networks, particularly in Wisconsin. But in light of the fact that this is additional cash coming in, it really would not have any material effect on our rate review.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Meaning as long as the CapEx increase and the bonus D&A impact on rate base are a one-for-one swap.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","Correct.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is correct. You stated it very well.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And are there enough projects that you don't need to \u2013 that don't have lengthy approval processes where you could make a $400 million to $500 million a year increase in your capital budget for like the 2017-2018 timeframe? And that just seems like a very significant increase. If you're saying that bonus D&A is worth about $1 billion to you, that would be a pretty significant increase to the capital budget. I'm just trying to think about the ability to actually execute that type of CapEx increase.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we don't have $400 million to $500 million a year of additional projects, but I would say to you that looking at our legitimate backlog of investment needs, what we can pull forward is very significant. And then in the back half of that period, remember the period is really 2015 through 2019, in the back half of that period, as I mentioned in our prepared remarks, if the proposed time table for the clean power plant compliance stays on track, we may be looking at the need for investment in our fleet either additional renewables, additional natural gas-fired generation. So those could be some fairly large projects in the back half of this period that we're talking about, but certainly in the front half of the period, 2016, 2017-ish. We really are looking at smaller discrete projects, such as additional ability to replace aging underground lines, replace and upgrade substation transformers, more distribution automation, those types of projects. They really don't meet the threshold of a specific approval from any of the regulators.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. And this one maybe for Allen. Just trying to think about ATC and the impact bonus depreciation would have on ATC's earnings power and therefore its earnings contribution up to WEC.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Yeah. So I think when Gale talked about, in the prepared remarks, the $1 billion worth of cash from the tax savings, that included in effect our ownership share of ATC. So it's certainly not in addition to that. It's already included in that estimate. As you know, Michael, the transmission projects are pretty long lead time, so I can't see anything at all at or (40:37) ATC's capital budget of 2016 and 2017. But the team at ATC is looking at things that can be pulled into the back half of the period that Gale mentioned, say, in 2018 and 2019, which would allow us or ATC to pull some projects up that are beneficial to customers.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Last one, and somebody asked a little bit of this, but I'm just curious. You issued a lot of very low cost debt at the holding company to pay for Integrys \u2013 to pay for part of the equity component of Integrys. Just curious about how you are thinking about over the next two to three, three to four years, how much of that holding company debt you would like to term out versus how much of that holding company debt you would like to simply take out and reduce the leverage at the holding company level.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Very good question, Michael. And the honest answer to you is, we're going to continue to iterate as we move along. I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we have additional distribution network projects that we can use the additional cash to very beneficial use for customers. As Allen mentioned, there are maybe some additional transmission investments in the back half of that five-year period. There may be a generation investment because of Clean Power Plan compliance.","But the other option we have is further deleveraging of the holding company. There will be some deleveraging in the plan to begin with. It just will happen, given our \u2013 the way we've laid out our forecast. But we also have the opportunity to deleverage.","So what we are going to do as we continue to move forward through this period here is we're going to say, okay, what is the best use of the cash for our customers and shareholders, and put that cash to the best use we can. And what we were trying to do for you is lay out the series of options that we have that will balance going forward. So I can't give you a precise answer at this point in time other than additional beyond the plan deleveraging of the holding company is an option.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. Thank you, Gale and Allen. Much appreciated.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Welcome. I will you see in a few days, Michael.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","I will see you in two weeks, yes.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Great.

(Broker)","Just to follow on that last question on the parent debt, when is the first call date? I mean, you'd probably have to pay a premium prior to callable dates, correct?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Are you thinking about the holding company debt, or are you talking...","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yeah, holding company debt.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, we got to carve it up. There's multiple debt instruments at the holding company, Brian, between the hybrid. Are you talking specifically the acquisition debt?","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Yes, acquisition debt.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm sorry. The acquisition debt, the first tranche expires at the end of three years, so 2018. So, it was three, five and 10 years, so 2018, 2020 and 2025.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Three, five and 10 years, and then about $300 million of commercial paper.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Correct.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Got it. And just to be clear, this is embedded in your 5% to 7% EPS CAGR or it's an addition to it? Just how does those moving parts work in terms of the CAGR?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","When you say \u2013 all of that debt is embedded.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","No. I mean, is there assumption for debt reduction of the acquisition debt in the 5% to 7% CAGR?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. Well, we're assuming that \u2013 again, we want to see what kind of flexibility we have, but we'll either retire it or refinance it.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Okay. Understood. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Dan Jenkins with State of Wisconsin Investment Board. Please go ahead.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi. Good afternoon.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Dan, how are you?","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Good. And congratulations to both of you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you. Dan, I am so glad you called since this is my last call, and I've been wanting to have a conversation with you about all the advice that I've freely given you about your behavior over the years, and I'm hoping that I've been helpful to you \u2013 improved behavior on your part. I was just thinking, though, with this being my last call, I just wanted to offer you, and you can certainly feel free to think about this, but I just wanted to offer you perhaps, for a nominal fee, being your life coach going forward. What do you think, Dan?","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","You mean Allen isn't going to take that over?","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Dan, now we know there's going to be a second change. No more Mexican food and no kicking Jenkins around.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And I know you're going to miss that, Dan. But what can we do for you today, Dan?","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","First just a clarification. You gave your expectation for 2016 on the energy sales. And I'm not sure I got for the large industrial ex mines. It was 1-point-what?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","1.2%, Dan.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","And so, related to that, I was kind of curious where you see that coming from, given how 2015 performed, that seems like kind of a pickup. But I wondered if you could give us more color on that. And somewhat related to that, I was wondering if you are seeing any impact in the sand customers related to what's going on with the energy.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","A very good question, Dan. And let me try to cover the waterfront for you. Pat and Scott should add any color they would like to add. But first of all, let me tackle the frac sand. In essence, given the frac sand operations, and there are about 110 of them in the western part of the State of Wisconsin. We really don't serve electricity to any of the major ones in the western part of the state. It's really \u2013 that's really natural gas demand for us. And because we've just completed in November the largest expansion of our natural gas distribution network in Wisconsin gas history, we haven't up till now served a significant amount of the frac sand demand for natural gas.","So while the frac sand industry has declined along with the big drop in oil prices, we still have an opportunity to grow over the longer term and the medium term in terms of our natural gas distribution service to that industry in the western part of the state. So long story short, because we haven't had a lot of the service in place or a lot of the capability in place up until now, we've not really been hurt to any significant degree by the decline in the frac sand business in light of the oil crash, if I'm making any sense.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Sure. Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Then in terms of industrial demand for electricity and how are we seeing a percent-or-so growth, a couple of thoughts and then we'll ask Scott Lauber, our Treasurer, who tracks our electricity demand. I track it every day, he tracks it every hour. Long story short, we serve 17 different sectors of the industrial economy in the State of Wisconsin, and many of those sectors are either flat or slightly down when you look at 2015 performance.","But there are four sectors where we have significant concentration in Wisconsin that actually have shown a little growth and we think may continue to show some growth in our projections in 2016. So that's food processing, paper production, printing, and plastics. So those are fairly large industrial sectors. Among the 17, those four are pretty large. And we've actually seen some uptick throughout 2015 in those four sectors. And that, in part, underlies the percent-or-so growth that we're projecting for 2016. Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - Vice President & Treasurer","In addition, we have some attractive rates to bring in new customers into the area. So we are actually seeing some customers building specifically in Southeastern Wisconsin some distribution centers, Amazon built here. So we're seeing that \u2013 and those actually are increasing our load in 2016 also.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, it's a very good point. And, for example, Scott mentioned Amazon, well, they just built a 1 million square foot distribution center that's now operational. And now that they've got it operational, I believe they've announced they're adding another 250,000 square feet right immediately adjacent to the 1 million square feet that they just built.","Uline, which is a major company that has moved to Wisconsin in the last seven or eight years, is just growing by leaps and bounds, and they're adding distribution capacity. So we're seeing, as Scott said, not only some strength in some of the traditional clusters in Wisconsin, but we're also seeing some large commercial growth that is now in place and beginning to operate.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Then the second thing I was curious about, you mentioned that your kind of two workshops in of the six workshops around the main replacement plan at Peoples Gas, I was wondering if you could give a little color on kind of what the discussion's been there in terms of the Commission concerns or Commission directives or if they've had any recommendations.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, actually, no recommendations yet. But I've been very encouraged by the entire approach that the Illinois Commerce Commission has decided to take in terms of taking, as we suggested, a fresh look at the entire program. The workshops are very granular and technical in nature. So for example, at one of the workshops, folks from the federal pipeline safety administration have been invited to come in and discuss the 2011 call to action from the federal government to replace some of these aging cast iron and bare steel pipes.","So this is \u2013 the way that workshops have gone so far, and you're right, two of the six have been completed, and the subject matter for the remaining four are public and the agendas are public. It's really almost stepping back and let's taking \u2013 take a complete reexamination for the need, the schedule and the shorter and long term cost estimates. And then importantly, and one of the workshops will be dedicated to this, cooperation and collaboration with the City of Chicago. And I can't tell you how important that is. I mean, while we are in the process of trying to replace 2,000 miles of aging underground pipes in Chicago, the City of Chicago is also trying to replace a significant number of aging water mains. So cooperation in terms of trying to get that work done in a scheduled collaborative basis is a real issue that needs \u2013 we need to continue to work on this. I think we've made real progress with the City of Chicago in terms of sharing information and planning for construction. But one of those workshops is really going to be dedicated to, okay, how can the two entities that are ripping up streets in Chicago best work together. So very technical in nature, but really going through \u2013 again, it's almost a complete new primer on the need for the program and how the program should be structured and scheduled going forward.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","So would you expect any revisions potentially to the CapEx budget related to the resolution of this process or how should we think about that?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the way I would think about it is, certainly the Illinois Commerce Commission is interested in the timetable and the cost. And originally, the commission set a deadline of 2030 to complete that program. I think we all want to talk about is that still a realistic deadline for completing the program; how much can efficiently and effectively be spent in any given year, and how much risk would be taken if you extended the program.","But right now, while all of that is still being processed and all of that's still being discussed, and I believe the Commission will vote on a new plan in June, the best advice I could give you is to stick with the $250 million to $280 million a year investment plan. That's what we're finding right now. It's probably the sweet spot in terms of how much can be done efficiently during the construction (53:58) Chicago.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then just wanted to say, given your successful completion of Power the Future and Integrys, you've obviously made a large impact on the company and left a tough legacy for Allen to follow. So, good luck.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","To whom was that addressed?","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Thank you, Dan.","Daniel F. Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Bye.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Bye-bye.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Steve. You don't need a life coach, do you?","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","I hope not. Thanks, Gale, and congrats on your retirement on time and on budget.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Congrats as well to Allen. So just a quick follow-up on the Illinois process. So could you maybe give a little color if the AG's office is kind of involved in these discussions on this kind of new plan? And then also, there is some attempt to still go back and keep looking back at what happened, just any color on where you see that process heading?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, I'd be happy to, Steve. First of all, the six workshops that the Illinois Commerce Commission has scheduled, the invitees are really all of the parties that have been involved in this entire program from day one. So it would be the Citizens Utility Board, it would be the City of Chicago, it would be the State Attorney General's Office. It would be a significant representation from the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. In fact, the workshops are being moderated by the head of the natural gas division of the Illinois Commerce Commission. And all of the folks that have been invited to participate are participating.","From what we've seen so far in the first two workshops, I would say that there are more informational type questions. I mean, for example, the State Attorney General's Office has asked, \"Well, does all the cast iron pipe that's a certain age really need to be replaced?\" So they're very technical questions. I mean, this is almost, I think, a terrific opportunity to get everybody on the same basis in terms of information and knowledge about the program. So I'm actually very encouraged by the approach that the Illinois Commerce Commission has taken. I think it will be an opportunity, again, to put everybody on the same basis of information and also really have a very strong dialogue with the natural gas division of how the company and the City of Chicago need to cooperate in the streets.","So that's really kind of the color I would give you so far. Again, very encouraged by the participation, by the kind of questions, and by the understanding that's building that with this kind of aging infrastructure, this is something that should not, cannot be ignored. So that would be my thoughts on the workshops.","And again, we've filed a three-year plan that put our top priorities in place for the neighborhoods that we thought were most at risk, and we'll see what the Commission decides. But their plan would be to vote on the longer-term future for the advanced main replacement program by June. And again, I would say to you, given everything we've seen around the country, both from a natural gas and water standpoint, it's just not \u2013 I don't think anyone thinks it's wise to ignore the urgent need to upgrade that system in Chicago.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And then going backward, the Attorney General's Office is asking, as they have, about an $8 billion cost estimate for the long-term investment need of the program, and that need or that cost estimate surfaced, as you know, immediately after we acquired the company. And so the Attorney General's Office is wondering, who knew in the prior company, the prior management, about the $8 billion estimate and why was the $8 billion estimate, which was a preliminary estimate, why was that not disclosed prior to the closing of the acquisition? So that docket, if you will, is still open before the Illinois Commerce Commission.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Great. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, Steve.","Steve Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Good luck.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Good afternoon.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul. How are you today?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","All right. Congratulations to both you..","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Thank you.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","...and Allen. One quick one for you here. The sales growth projection, does that include leap year or is that taken out?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That actually, includes leap year. Yep. It's worth about 0.3% (59:19).","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right. So that would indicate that you guys really are not expecting much in the way of any growth.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is correct.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","Yep.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Has there been a change in how you've begun to forecast things since it's been, generally speaking, lower than what you guys had \u2013 over the years, you guys have been a little bit more optimistic about sales growth than what's actually happened. Have you reappraised that, or are you guys just getting more \u2013 or is there something else that's driving you to wind down the sales growth?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think certainly given the experience of 2015 and 2014, and obviously we were projecting at least 0.5% growth in electric demand or electric consumption on the retail side in those prior years, we brought it down a little. There's no question about that.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","What do you think is going on?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I think there may be a couple of things here. And we ask ourselves \u2013 we have all kinds of meetings saying, what the hell is going on? But first of all, many companies in our industry were projecting far stronger growth than we have projected, and they haven't seen it develop either. My own view, and this is strictly a personal view and anecdotal, but just based on years of experience, I think there are three things going on.","2014 and 2015 may be a bit of an aberration from a small commercial and residential standpoint. 2014 and 2015, the weather was just mild is probably the best word, mild summers, mild winters, just no abnormally high or abnormally low temperatures, but no persistence of a weather trend. And one of the things that weather normalization techniques does not pick up is the lack of, say, 15 days of 90-degree weather. If you have two days of 90-degree weather, you can do the weather normalization. But I don't think it picks up the fact that you didn't have any persistent weather one way or another and persistent weather drives consumption and drives usage.","So, I think one thing that has happened is we haven't seen a really good long heat wave and even though last winter was a little bit colder than normal, it was spotty. It wasn't 15 days in a row of 10 degrees. So, in my mind, the jury is still out related to longer-term growth. If we get back to a year in which we have some consistent and persistent weather patterns. That's number one.","But number two, I don't think there's any question that we're seeing more residential conservation in the last couple of years. I don't think there's any question about that. And when you think about why that may be, I mean, it really comes down to technology. You've heard me say before that if you replace a big screen television that you may be bought seven or eight years ago with a brand new one, you're probably going to use 60% to 80% less electricity. Your iPad requires less energy to charge than your computer screen standalone. You buy a new washer and dryer. They're far more energy efficient, same thing with refrigerators. You have the Nest thermostats. There's just a lot more technology available to customers. So essentially, what we're kind of seeing here is our customer growth, which continues to be good, being offset by conservation.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. There have been some articles about these coal dust complaints by neighbors in around Oak Creek. Can you comment on that in terms of how should we think about that?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. Well, first of all, let me just reiterate that we have air monitors that continually give us data on emissions from the Oak Creek plant, and we are well within compliance with all the air standards, number one. Number two, there are a number of homes in the general vicinity of the Oak Creek plant where individuals have indicated they are having health problems, and they believe it's because of the infiltration of coal dust in their homes.","So, what we've agreed to do and what we're in the process right now is we have agreed with those homeowners on a testing protocol, and we are having a firm (1:03:55) go into each one of these homes and through samples collected them from various places in the homes of these individuals. And then we're having a lab analyze the dust samples and indicate to all of the homeowners \u2013 we're sending them over, explaining what is in their dust samples.","Right now, the scene would indicate that there are health problems, at least from our expert standpoint, nothing that would indicate that there are health problems from any prevalence of dust.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then back to the deleveraging potential, what would be the security or what would be the interest rate that you guys might be thinking about retiring? In other words, if you were to pay down debt at the parent, what are we thinking about in terms of the cost of that debt?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the average cost of the debt was 2.21%.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","Well, let's separate, I think it's important to kind of separate out the debt. There's the acquisition debt, which is the 2.21% as Gale just pointed out, and then there's all the other debt at the holding company.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","Example of which is the hybrid security that flips the floating at the end of this year. That's I believe paying 6.11% right now. And there's also some longer-term debt instruments at the holding company. Think of the hybrids and those longer-term bonds is what we're targeting for takeout, not the 2.21% debt.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. So the 6.11% would be the sort of pre-tax benefit you guys would see from buying it back, is that right? What you're thinking \u2013 I mean, obviously, (1:05:43) acquisition team may browse. But is that kind of what we're thinking about in terms of what the cost of the securities you're thinking of retiring potentially would be?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, that's one good example or if it wasn't retired and again, we're assessing what the best options are here. If it wasn't retired, it flips to a very low floating interest rate, right.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Right. I mean, that's why I'm sort of wondering about it. I mean, it would seem to me, what we're seeing is a lot of leverage that's being deployed in terms of acquisitions that are being proposed and what have you recently. And I'm just wondering given the cost of debt, it doesn't usually look like that big a bang for the buck. And I just wonder if you'd elaborate a little bit more in terms of you're thinking process about that. Your credit ratings for the most part are pretty strong. So, I mean, I'm just sort of thinking about sort of why you guys are bringing this up now and sort of what might be driving that?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll give a shot at that. I think the real answer to your question is we wanted to show the range of options that we have for beneficial use of the cash that's coming from bonus depreciation. And clearly, our preferred option is to benefit customers from that cash with projects that really are useful and needed for reliability. So that's option one, two, three, four, and five.","And, as Allen mentioned, there may be \u2013 in the latter part of that five-year period for bonus depreciation, there may be the emergence of some transmission projects or generation projects for compliance with the Clean Power Plan. So all of those things are kind of preferred options. But if none of those things or if not all of them came to pass, we also have an option to further deleverage beyond the plan.","So, it really wasn't \u2013 we didn't mean to give you the idea that this was going to be an immediate type of a preferred priority. It is something we have in the toolbox if needed.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. But not perhaps all that likely to be used, depending on what opportunities are in the business as well?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That's how I would look at it. It is an option, and we'll iterate as we go along for the best benefit of customers and shareholders.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Thanks so much and congratulations again.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right. Thank you, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hey, Paul.

Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And what was the fuel, under or over recovery in the fourth quarter?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","In the fourth quarter we were fully recovered I think going into Q4.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay.","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","So it's...","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then your comment...","Allen L. Leverett - President & Director","We'll follow offline...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We'll get the precise number for you and we'll get the precise number and we'll ask Colleen or Beth to give you a callback. But it was not a material impact on earnings in Q4.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then can you review your comments on Trillium and what the gain is and when you'll realize that?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'll ask Allen to comment but we expect pre-tax cash proceeds of approximately $130 million. But again, that sale falls within the window of purchase price accounting adjustments. So, in terms of the report of ongoing earnings that we would provide to you next quarter, it won't have any impact on plus or minus on earnings. Allen?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Thank you very much. Oh, go ahead...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. Allen was saying, yeah.","Paul T.

A double dip today.","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","Yeah. A follow-up question. Quick new bucket, since there's been so many moving pieces here, what you expect maybe broadly speaking, the earnings contributions from WPS, We, Power The Future and Peoples, just the big buckets, for 2016, just so our models are all calibrated correctly?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Okay. I'm going to look toward Pat and Scott. I've got a general idea, but they've got more specific bucket delineation than I have right in front of me.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","Can I do it by segment, Jim? That might be easier on the call.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Why don't we take it by segment and like by state.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","Yeah. So by segment or by state, if you look at Wisconsin, maybe 16%; 11% Illinois; 2% from our MERC and MGU, so our Michigan and Minnesota Gas Utilities; maybe 10% from ATC.

Lauber - Vice President & Treasurer","20%.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer","Do the math in whatever I missed, 20%?","James von Riesemann - Mizuho Securities USA, Inc.","71%, 81%, 83%, so 17%.","Allen L.

Thank you for waiting, and welcome to Wisconsin Energy's Conference Call to Review 2015 First Quarter Results. This call is being recorded for rebroadcast, and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I will read the forward-looking language. All statements in this presentation other than historical facts are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, which are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in the company's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be opened to analysts for questions and answers. In conjunction with this call, Wisconsin Energy has posted on its website a package of detailed financial information at wisconsinenergy.com. A replay of our remarks will be available later today.","And now, it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Colleen, thank you. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2015 first quarter results.","Let me begin as always by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer.","Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment, but as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported adjusted earnings of $0.90 a share for the first quarter of 2015. This compares with earnings of $0.91 a share for the first quarter last year. Our adjusted earnings exclude expenses of $0.04 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group.","Well, the story of the first quarter was our cold winter weather. Though not nearly as extreme as the weather that gripped our region last year, temperatures were almost 12% colder than normal, driving strong customer demand for natural gas. In fact, during February, we delivered more natural gas to our retail customers than during any other February in our history, exceeding last year's record by 5.5%.","I'm also pleased to report that our natural gas distribution networks performed exceptionally well, underscoring the benefit to customers of our Deliver the Future program. You may recall that as part of Deliver the Future, we're accelerating the replacement of older natural gas distribution lines, the lines that are most susceptible to stress during severe weather.","Turning now to the state of the economy, the Wisconsin unemployment rate fell to 4.6% in March. That's the state's lowest unemployment rate since 2008 and is nearly a full percentage point better than the national average of 5.5%. Wisconsin added more than 48,000 private sector jobs between March of 2014 and March of 2015. And as the economy continues to improve, deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers improved as well, rising by 0.6% in the first quarter.","Sectors that showed particular strength included plastics, printing and food processing. In addition, we continue to see an uptick in customer growth across our system. Through early May, new electric service connections are up almost 19% and new natural gas installations are up nearly 14% compared to the same time period last year.","Now, later in my remarks, I'll update you on other developments in our core business, and the important construction projects we have underway. But first, I'd like to discuss our progress in obtaining regulatory approvals for the acquisition of Integrys. To refresh your memory, on June 23 last year, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Our analysis shows that combining the two companies to form the WEC Energy Group meets or exceeds all three criteria that we use to evaluate potential acquisition opportunities.","First, we believe the acquisition will be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Of course, that would be 2016. Second, we believe it will be largely credit neutral. And finally, we believe the long-term growth rate will be at least equal to Wisconsin Energy's standalone growth rate. We expect the combined company will grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year, faster than either of us is projecting on a standalone basis with more than 99% of those earnings coming from regulated businesses.","Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with increased scale and geographic proximity. And over time, we'll enhance the operations of the seven utilities that will be part of our company by incorporating best practices system-wide. We believe that customers could actually see as much as $1 billion of savings over the next 10 years through a combination of lower capital and operating costs in Wisconsin.","In addition, Integrys today, as you may recall, owns a 34.1% interest in American Transmission Company. Wisconsin Energy owns 26.2%. That means the combined entity will have a 60% stake in one of the largest independent transmission companies in the United States.","ATC has a 10-year capital investment plan to bolster electric reliability in our region that calls for an investment of $3.3 billion to $3.9 billion by the year 2023. We believe it's a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment to the transmission business.","So where do we stand in getting the regulatory approvals for our acquisition of Integrys? Again to refresh your memory, the proposed acquisition was approved by Wisconsin Energy and Integrys shareholders last November. In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice completed its review under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act in October of last year with no further action required by the company.","Just a few weeks ago on April 7, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission found the transaction to be in the public interest and issued an order with no conditions other than those we proposed. Then on April 13, the Federal Communications Commission approved the transfer of certain communication licenses. So all federal approvals for the transaction are now complete.","Turning to the state proceedings, the Michigan Commission issued its approval on April 23 and the Wisconsin Commission voted to approve the transaction at its open meeting on April 30, determining the transaction to be in the best interest of utility customers, stockholders and the public. The Wisconsin Commission applied several conditions to its approval, including a requirement that we share with customers for a three-year period beginning in 2016 any earnings at Wisconsin Electric and Wisconsin Gas that are above our allowed rates of return.","In addition, Wisconsin Public Service, the Integrys utility based in Green Bay, will not be allowed to build a new natural gas-fired generating unit unless a study of the joint needs of all our companies determines a need for new capacity. We expect to receive a final written order from the Wisconsin Commission by the end of May. In Minnesota, the commission there is expected to review our application during May and the schedule for the Illinois Commerce Commission calls for a decision no later than July 6.","In summary, we're making excellent progress on all regulatory fronts and we anticipate closing the transaction now by the end of this summer.","Now, before we discuss the status of our ongoing construction projects, I'd also like to take just a moment to follow up on the settlement agreement in Michigan. As we discussed during our previous calls, we've been working toward a long-term electric reliability solution for the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, in cooperation with the Michigan Governor, the Michigan Attorney General, the Michigan Commission staff, and iron ore mines.","We reached an agreement on March 12 that replaced the original arrangement we had announced in January. The revised agreement includes the following important elements. First, Wisconsin Electric will retain ownership of the Presque Isle Power Plant and our current electric distribution (8:40) assets. The iron ore mines have entered into long-term contracts to purchase power from Wisconsin Electric. Wisconsin Energy then expressed a willingness, if requested, to invest in a new generating plant in the Upper Peninsula and\/or purchase power from the new facility. This will allow for the eventual retirement of the Presque Isle Plant.","And finally, Wisconsin Energy would potentially create a separate Michigan-only utility. If formed, our electric customers residing in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan would become part of this utility and the utility would be a subsidiary of Wisconsin Energy. Overall, we're very pleased with this result.","And now turning to recent developments in our core business. As you may recall, last July, we received the final written order from the Wisconsin Commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral, which will span an 85 mile route through Western and Central Wisconsin. The project will address natural gas reliability concerns in that region of the state. It will also help meet the demand being driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and demand from the sand mining industry.","The commission's approval also includes franchise awards for 10 communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those communities. We began work last October on portions of the downstream facilities. Two of the three branch lines were installed by mid November. Construction of the third branch line began in January and is now nearing completion. Route clearing for the final large diameter lateral is now complete. Construction on the regulator stations is on schedule and 100% of the large diameter steel pipe has been delivered to our work yards. We are on time, we are on budget and we expect to complete the project in the fourth quarter of this year at a projected cost of $175 million to $185 million excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","On the generation side of our business, you'll recall that we are converting the fuel source for our Valley Power Plant from coal to natural gas. The two unit Valley Plant is a cogeneration facility located along the Menominee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and also provides important voltage support for the electric network.","The Valley conversion project achieved another milestone on April 10, that's when unit two started its coal to gas conversion outage and the Valley Power Plant stopped burning coal after more than 46 years. Unit two should be completed by early fall in time for the next heating season. Unit one, of course, achieved commercial operation burning natural gas last November. Overall, the Valley project is more than 70% complete. We expect the total cost to range between $65 million and $70 million again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating costs and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts.","Now, I'd like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls Hydroelectric Plant, located on the border of Wisconsin and Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Twin Falls was built back in the day in 1912 and is one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. Construction began in late 2013 to build a new powerhouse and add spillway capacity to meet current federal standards. Construction activities have now resumed at Twin Falls after a planned break for the winter. We continue to make good progress on all the major construction work. The upstream cofferdam is finished, rock excavation is roughly 90% complete, and overall the project is on time and on budget with approximately 42% of the work now finished.","We will begin physical construction of the new powerhouse later this spring, and we expect to achieve commercial operation in the summer of 2016. We're forecasting the total investment at $60 million to $65 million, again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Also, we continue to make excellent progress on our initiative to improve fuel flexibility at our Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were initially permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers between $25 million and $50 million a year depending upon the blend.","So, after receiving the necessary environmental approvals, we began making changes to the boilers and testing various blends of bituminous and PRB coal at the plant. We have actually conducted limited testing on unit two at levels of up to a 100% PRB. Although, the testing has gone very well, there are operational issues that need to be addressed and equipment that must be modified. So, last July, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve additional capital spending to modify the plant. Our share of that investment would be $21 million. If approved, the modifications are expected to support sustained operation at up to 60% PRB and allow us to continue testing blends of up to 100% PRB.","We also need space on equipment to handle additional coal inventory on the site. As a result, we filed a request with the Wisconsin Commission last October for an expanded cold storage facility and additional handling equipment. Our share of the estimated capital cost for this project is $58 million. We hope to receive commission approval from both of these initiatives this summer.","Looking forward, we continue to see significant investment opportunities in our existing core business as we upgrade our aging distribution networks and focus on delivering the future. Our capital budget calls for spending $3.3 billion to $3.5 billion for a five-year period 2015 through 2019. Our rolling 10-year capital budget calls for investing between $6.6 billion and $7.2 billion over the period 2015 through 2024.","Turning now to our dividend policy, our current standalone policy targets a dividend payout ratio trending to 65% to 70% of earnings in 2017, a policy that's more competitive with our peers across the regulated utility sector. At the closing of the Integrys acquisition, we expect to increase the dividend for Wisconsin Energy stockholders by 7% to 8% to achieve parity with the Integrys shareholders. Going forward, the payout target for the combined company is projected to be at 65% to 70% of earnings.","In conclusion, we're off to a strong start both financially and operationally in 2015 and we're pleased with the progress we've made as we work to finalize our acquisition of Integrys.","And now, for more details on our first quarter, here's our Chief Financial Officer, Pat Keyes. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2015 first quarter adjusted earnings were $0.90 a share compared with $0.91 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2014. Consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our two business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.","Our consolidated operating income for the first quarter was $358.8 million as compared to $381.08 million in 2014. That's a decrease of $23 million. Starting with the Utility Energy segment, you will see that operating income in the first quarter totaled $276.5 million for 2015, a decrease of $16.2 million from the first quarter of 2014. On the favorable side, we estimate that our operating income increased by $14.7 million because of the impacts of the 2015 rate case.","On the downside, we estimate that our gas and electric margins decreased by $20.6 million because of the weather. As Gale mentioned earlier, the first quarter of 2015 was cold. Our heating degree days were up almost 12% as compared to normal. However, heating degree days last year were 24% higher than normal due to the polar vortex. In addition, our depreciation expense increased by $4.3 million due to additional capital placed into service.","Operating income in the Non-Utility segment was up $1.4 million when compared to 2014. This increase reflects additional investment at our Power the Future plants. Our Corporate and Other segment showed an operating loss of $9.3 million this quarter as compared to $1.1 million loss in the first quarter of 2014. This increase is directly driven by costs associated with the acquisition. Taking the changes for these segments together, we arrived at the $23 million decline in operating income.","During the first quarter, earnings from our investment in the American Transmission Company totaled $16.1 million, a slight decline from the same period last year. This decline was in line with our expectations, and is directly related to an anticipated reduction and authorized returns for transmission companies.","Our other income net increased by $1.9 million, largely because of higher AFUDC. AFUDC increased primarily because of our gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin. Our net interest expense decreased by $2.6 million, primarily because of lower long-term interest rates. Last year, we replaced maturing debt with new debt at lower rates. Consolidated income tax expense fell by $7.9 million because of lower pre-tax earnings. Our effective income tax rate was in line with the prior year. We expect our annual effective tax rate for 2015 to be between 37% and 38%.","Combining all of these items brings you to $195.8 million of net income for the first quarter of 2015, or earnings of $0.86 per share. Our adjusted earnings which exclude $0.04 of acquisition related costs were $0.90 per share.","During the first quarter of 2015, our operating cash flows totaled $329.7 million, which is $55.4 million less than 2014. In January, we contributed $100 million to our pension trust, which reduced operating cash flows. No contributions were made in 2014. Our capital expenditures totaled $149.5 million in the first quarter, a $20.3 million increase compared to 2014. The largest increase was related to the gas expansion project in Western Wisconsin.","Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.6% at the end of March. Our calculation treats half of our hybrid securities as common equity, which is consistent with past presentations. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plan, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares except of course for those shares in connection with the acquisition of Integrys.","We also paid $95.3 million in common dividends in the first quarter of 2015, an increase of $7.2 million over the first quarter last year. Weather-normalized retail deliveries of electricity fell by 0.7% in the first quarter 2015, as compared to the first quarter of 2014. Actual first quarter deliveries fell by 2.4%.","Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw weather-normalized residential deliveries drop by 3.1%. Actual residential deliveries fell 7.1%. Across our small commercial industrial group, weather-normal quarterly deliveries were flat with last year. Actual deliveries fell by 1.2%. In the large commercial industrial segment, deliveries for the first quarter of 2015 were up by 0.6%. If you exclude the iron ore mines, large commercial and industrial deliveries fell by 0.5%.","Our first quarter weather-normalized retail gas deliveries, excluding gas used for power generation, improved by 2.2% compared to the same period in 2014. Our actual gas deliveries, again excluding gas used for power generation, were down 6.8% compared to the polar-vortex-driven gas sales in last year's first quarter. Our overall results for gas and electric sales in the first quarter are in line with our expectations for the year.","Turning now to our earnings forecast, we are reaffirming our 2015 standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share. We're off to a strong start, but we still have nine more months of weather ahead of us. Again, we are reaffirming our standalone adjusted guidance of $2.67 a share to $2.77 a share.","Finally, let's take a look at second quarter guidance. Last year's second quarter adjusted earnings were $0.59 a share, which excludes $0.01 a share related to our acquisition of Integrys. Last year's second quarter earnings were buoyed by a favorable O&M cost and lower benefits costs. This year, our maintenance schedule calls for more work in the second quarter than we performed last year.","In addition, our April weather this year was much milder than last year. Taking these factors into account, we expect our second quarter 2015 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $0.54 to $0.56 a share. That assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter and excludes transaction-related costs. Once again, our second quarter 2015 adjusted guidance is $0.54 to $0.56 a share.","And with that, I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thanks much, Pat. Overall, we are solidly on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","And now, we would like to take your questions. Your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Hi, Greg. How are you?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Hey, Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How you doing?","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I have two questions. The first one is how do you feel about the Packers draft?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","My summation of that is the Jets still suck.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Fair enough. Fair enough. Probably true. Can you talk about the sales growth in the first quarter in the context of you still feeling like you are on track for the year? I know \u2013 because the residential weather-normal demand was down 3.1%.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Is that just sort of maybe a statistical issue or do you expect that to reverse later in the year? That's my main question.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good question, Greg. The short answer is, yeah, I do think that the first quarter residential weather-normal numbers are a statistical anomaly. You've heard me say this before, but the weather-normalization techniques that are available to companies like ours, they simply break down when you get two to three standard deviations off the norm. And last year, with the polar vortex, particularly as it hit the Midwest and Wisconsin, I mean we were way, way off the norm. So, I honestly don't put much stock in the weather-normal numbers for the first quarter.","On the other hand, if you look at our large commercial and industrial segment, which is far less weather sensitive, you saw an uptick of 0.6% even compared to the polar vortex numbers of a year ago. So, as we've looked at this and believe me, we have analyzed this about 14 ways to Sunday, our bottom line conclusion is we are on track overall for what we expected for the year. And we weren't expecting, as you know, significant uptick in kilowatt hour sales. So we feel pretty good about where we stand. And again, I would take with a grain of salt the weather-normal numbers when you compare it to such an extraordinary period a year ago. Hope that helps, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Yes, thank you very much. When you talk to your industrial and commercial customers about their planned economic activity for the next 12 months, I know you do a lot of economic development and you stay very close to those...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We do.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","...those customers. What is the tenor of \u2013 their mood about capital investment, hiring and the outlook?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I would say \u2013 and let me answer that in two ways. From the standpoint of commercial development, downtown office towers, retail centers being developed, we're seeing more commercial development than I think we've seen in the entire decade that I have been in this region. So our commercial customers, I would say, are showing just very solid optimism. Our industrial customers are, I would say, much more cautiously optimistic, nothing that would show huge growth, but on the other hand, I would say steady as she goes from the general input we're getting from our industrial customers.","And then, of course, we should see an interesting development in the second quarter. You may recall me mentioning that Amazon has built a 1 million square foot, it's huge, a 1 million square foot distribution center south of Milwaukee and north of the Illinois line, that construction is complete. They're hiring and we should see that that 1 million square foot facility and a lot of ancillary development opening this summer.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Thanks very much, Gale. Have a good day.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You take care, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","How you doing, Julien?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Hi, good afternoon.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon to you.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Excellent. So, first question here more on the balance sheet side of the equation. In terms of your pro forma metrics for the transaction, how do you see yourself trending within your targeted ranges? And ultimately as you see yourself more structurally what kind of metrics are you targeting pro forma, just perhaps with respect to your rating (27:40) but also even within that kind of the FFO metrics, if you will?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me start out by framing our overall objective, and then we can talk through some of the more specifics. Our overall objective, remember, going back to one of our three most important criteria for acquisitions would be that we would maintain largely credit neutrality for the acquisition. We would fully expect based on the input we're receiving from the credit rating agencies to maintain our A category credit rating. So that basically, fundamentally, where we expect to stay, and where we have planned to stay.","And then of course, as you know, the agencies have very specific debt to total cap and FFO metrics tied to being in \u2013 being \u2013 qualifying to stay in that credit rating, but we would expect very much to stay within the A category credit rating. Current thinking, of course, is unchanged related to the amount of debt at the holding company that we would add for the acquisition. Right now, we are still projecting about $1.5 billion of debt at the holding company to complete the acquisition and that would be, Pat, in 3-year, 5-year and 10-year tranches.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Correct, Gale.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And equally spread across the tranches.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yes.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So that's basically my general response to that. Perhaps Scott, Allen, anything you want to add?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Julien, was there something more specific you were after?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Well, I was just wondering where within those metrics \u2013 I mean how much pressure, you talk about maintaining largely credit neutrality, but just how much pressure probably at the lower end of that range within the FFO?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Let me try it this way. The one thing that when we talked to the rating agencies almost a year ago now, there is nothing going on at the utilities, so the only activity we focused on and they focused on was at the holding company. And you may have seen \u2013 let's use Moody's as an example. In June of 2014, I believe we were \u2013 outlook was down...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Negative outlook.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Negative outlook, and then this morning they announced that we were on...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Negative watch.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, negative watch. That's all consistent. So I mean, in that, when we first went in and said we're going to put $1.5 billion acquisition down in the holding company, they said okay, that's what we think in June. Now, the triggering event was the Wisconsin Commission approval and now we took the next step. So, fairly consistent. I don't know I can get any more specific than that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. Hey, no worries. Thank you. And then just in terms of execution of the transaction, I know it's a little early here, but can you talk a little bit to the best practices and just ability to kind of, how should we say, turn around the Peoples Gas business and opportunity set there? I don't want to get too close to the synergies per se, but just kind of more qualitative, if you will.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, I appreciate the questions, Julien, and I think very simply, let me start off with basically our overall mission statement. Once we complete the acquisition, we intend to function as one company, one team with seven customer facing brands, all focused on customer satisfaction and operational efficiency. That's basically the mantra, the mission, and how we will go about achieving the important objectives that we've laid out for the transaction including meeting all three of the criteria that we continue to talk about is the criteria that we use for any acquisition opportunity. As you probably have read specifically related to your question on Peoples Gas, we were asked by the Illinois Commerce Commission what our plans would be for management of Peoples Gas and we responded to the Illinois Commission in writing committing that we would essentially place a minimum of three new senior officers from our team at Peoples Gas. So that will be one of the first steps that we will take immediately following the acquisition. We will put a very experienced professional, solid management team in place at People Gas. We're going to find, we know this already some very talented people in the operational ranks with Peoples Gas. So I think we're going to have a really solid team from day one at Peoples Gas and the Peoples Gas organization will report directly to me.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then lastly \u2013 were you saying something?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Obviously, I hope that gives you a flavor.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Absolutely. Just the last little detail. In terms of the timeline for closing you said late summer if I have it right. Is there any...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think we said by the end of the summer.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got you. Just in terms of the ICC schedule, is there any reason to think that it couldn't close earlier if you look at it at present?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, if we look at it at present, the Illinois Commerce Commission with the regulations and procedures that they follow in a case like this by statute unless there is some decision to delay, the Illinois Commerce Commission would make a decision by no later than July 6.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Got it. And then you would close very shortly thereafter in theory?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Once we receive the final approval, we'll close probably within three business days.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS Securities LLC","Okay. Just checking on the verbiage there. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome. Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Steven Fleishman with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Steve, how are you today?","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Hey, Gale, how are you?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm good.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","That's good. So just on the Illinois approval, it sounds like they kept the timeline despite some parties concerned about this investigation going on at the \u2013 one of Peoples Gas's programs. Could you just talk about that? And I guess maybe more importantly just how you've gotten comfortable that that is not an issue?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Sure. I'd be happy to, Steve. Well, first of all, just to explain the procedure with the Illinois Commerce Commission. The State Attorney General in Illinois filed a motion with the administrative law judge that is presiding over our merger case, petitioning the administrative law judge to, in essence, delay a ICC decision on our merger from the statutory deadline of July 6 for an additional 90 days, while the review continues on the management of the advanced main replacement program that Peoples Gas is undertaking. Both we and Integrys felt that a delay was not necessary, because there's a separate docket where the Illinois Commerce Commission is reviewing any concern and reviewing the manner in which the gas main replacement program has been managed. So there's a separate docket underway that will probably go on for a number of months.","The administrative law judge determined that a delay was simply not necessary and ruled in favor of no delay, the commission staff also suggested no delay. So at the moment, there would be nothing on the table that would postpone a decision by July 6. So I hope that's helpful on the scheduling standpoint.","In terms of the review of the \u2013 what's called AMRP, the advanced main replacement program, the Illinois Commerce Commission had already authorized an independent audit, if you will, of how People's is managing that construction program. And of course, that construction program, as you know, is very extensive. It will last probably at least for a 10-year period. The legislation actually covers the 10-year period in Illinois for the replacement of aging gas pipes in the City of Chicago. Some of those pipes, by the way, are Civil War era pipes, and really do badly need replacing. So long story short, there already was an external audit going on of the AMRP program and how it's been managed. That audit is well along an interim report. There is an auditing firm called Liberty and the Liberty report \u2013 the interim report is out and has been shared with us and we would expect, Allen, a final Liberty report I would assume within the next 30 days to 45 days.","Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation","There is a draft that's already out...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation","...of the final report.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, we have obviously been able to review all of the recommendations and all of the findings in the audit, both the interim findings and now the draft final review findings. And, Steve, that's how we're comfortable that that this program is manageable and it's certainly needed from the standpoint of upgraded infrastructure.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. And then just to clarify, in Wisconsin and the way the sharing works, my understanding is that above your ROE you share 50\/50 for the first 50 basis points and then above that level earnings would be used to pay down this deferral balance?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Is that essentially how this works?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is correct. We have a number of transmission costs that have been deferred on our balance sheet, that's we call it the transmission escrow. And what the commission has asked us to do, as you say correctly, above our authorized rates of return at Wisconsin Electric, which is 10.2 right now on that retail utility. So the first 50 basis points that we might earn in any years 2016, 2017 or 2018 above the 10.2, we would share with customers 50\/50, stockholders would keep 50%. The customer would receive the benefit through paying down the transmission escrow.","Steven Isaac Fleishman - Wolfe Research LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, Steve.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Brian Russo with Ladenburg Thalmann. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Rock and roll, Brian, how are you?","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg Thalmann & Co., Inc. (Broker)","Good, thank you. Actually all my questions have been asked and answered. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Can you think of a new question that hasn't been asked or answered, Paul?","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","I have got a handful of them, thanks.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good for you. All right. Give us your best shot here, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Pat, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly that the lower transmission was a function of the fact you are booking to a lower ROE?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct. We are...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yes.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's correct.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And are you disclosing that ROE?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We've taken our best shot in the zone of reasonableness and we invite you to do the same.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And the merger costs showed up on the O&M line on the income statement, all of them?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is correct.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","So net-net, excluding those, O&M was actually down for the quarter. What drove that?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Actually, you are absolutely correct. O&M was down for the quarter on an ongoing operational basis and it was really effective cost controls across virtually every part of our organization. It's not just one thing, but it clearly was very good cost control across, literally, every organization.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And absent outage timing, should that continue through the year?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We will see. I will say one thing. We did benefit, for example, on the gas distribution side of our business. We had \u2013 even with the colder than normal weather, we had materially fewer gas leaks to respond to this year and that's I think a direct benefit from the investments we've been making in our gas distribution network. So, the fact that we wouldn't experience severe weather in the next two quarters might mean that we don't see those kind of O&M savings on the gas side of our business. But by and large, I mean, our folks have just done a tremendous job of managing effectively from the standpoint of cost control.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And then I think when you gave initial guidance, Presque Isle was still getting SSR payments. How has the turn of events kind of changed \u2013 how does that play into guidance?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it doesn't play into guidance. We are no longer receiving SSR payments, but it doesn't play into guidance because the way rates were set at the end of 2014, in essence, the revenues, the margins from any sales to the mines, which have now basically stepped back into a power sales arrangement with us, any revenues and margins from those sales would really go to \u2013 go into escrow for dealing in the next \u2013 for treatment in the next rate case. Allen?","Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation","Right. And then you also escrow for SSR revenues.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right.","Allen L. Leverett - Co-President, Wisconsin Energy; President & CEO, We Generation","So, what Gale was explaining is that they made an assumption about SSR revenues. And to the extent that SSR revenues in this case are less, you book an escrow item. And then to the extent we get margin from the mines, you escrow that as well. So, it just all goes up on the balance sheet and there really is no income statement impact.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Right. So, on the balance sheet, it's like Ragu, it's in there.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Got it. And then kind of relative to 1Q guidance, I think you beat the midpoint by $0.10. Can you kind of explain where that came from?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, basically \u2013 and I'll frame it and Pat can give you some more specifics, but essentially, there are a couple of drivers. One would be \u2013 in terms of our guidance, one would be the colder weather that drove stronger gas and electric margins than we had anticipated in the budget; and the second is largely O&M control. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Right. I'll just put a little color to that, Paul. I agree completely with Gale. Weather was roughly $0.05 better than what we thought versus the guidance, and O&M was roughly $0.03 better. And again the best example of that, as Gale mentioned, was the gas expense for leaks.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Sounds good. Thank you very much.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Terrific. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Caroline Bone with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Good afternoon, Caroline. How are you doing?","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Good. Good afternoon. I was just curious if you could remind us what base year you are using when guiding to the 5% to 7% EPS CAGR for the pro forma company.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, the 5% to 7% combined company EPS projection really would be off of the year 2015.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay. That's great. And then also a minor question here, but what should we expect transaction costs to be for the full year in 2015?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, it depends upon how well Susan Martin controls our attorneys. And so far, that ain't so good. No, actually our attorneys have done very, very good work obviously and we're very much on schedule in terms of all the approval process. I'm looking at Pat to see if you have a total for this year only.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah. For this year only, about $20 million to $30 million and that's...","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","That's just the out-of-pocket lawyers and bankers. That's not all the other stuff that goes around change of control, et cetera.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","That is \u2013 Pat is correct. That's the out-of-pocket expenses, legal fees, investment banking fees, expert witness fees, other outside consultant fees that are required as we work through the regulatory process.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thank you. Just one more minor one. In your earnings package you guys talked about rate cases adding $14.7 million versus last year. Is that kind of a good run rate assumption for the rest of the year in each quarter in terms of the benefit?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","No. I would not use that as a run rate. Pat?","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","Yeah, I think this quarter is going to be a little higher.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay.","James Patrick Keyes - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President","And the reason for that is if you look back at 2014, January, we did not collect SSR. So that delta is going to be higher. In this quarter, so \u2013 then running out will be the same. So whatever you see in Q2 might be a good prediction, but one is a little high.","Caroline V. Bone - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.","Okay, great. Thanks a lot.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're welcome, Caroline.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Michael, do you have any more of those blue things we drank one night?","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","No. I have not. That's a good idea. It's been a while. It's been a couple of years. We should catch up on that if we can find that place.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Exactly.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Two questions. One, really a little bit of a follow-up on Caroline's one. Can you remind us what were the rate increases \u2013 base rate increases granted in 2015 by the PSC for both WEPCO and WG?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We didn't \u2013 have got the specific numbers here with us and we're going to ask Scott Lauber or Pat to give you that. Overall, when you take into account a fuel cost reduction that we were able to put into rates (45:05), overall, our electric rates are only up about 0.1%, but it differs between customer segments. Scott?","Scott J. Lauber - Treasurer & Vice President","Yeah. That's correct. So, Wisconsin Electric is just up a small 0.1%; if you put the fuel and it's actually down about 0.4%; and if you look at Wisconsin Gas, it was up about 2.6% on the margin.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Yeah, my apologies, I may have asked the question poorly. I recall that there was a base rate increase at WEPCO for this year?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","There was.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Can you just \u2013 let's leave fuel out of the equation, I'm just trying to think about base rates.","Scott J. Lauber - Treasurer & Vice President","Yeah, the base rates were up were 0.1%, but remember, we're giving about 0.5% back as a credit this year and that credit was really like a base rate, it increase also.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","So, a long story short, I would use 0.1%.","Scott J. Lauber - Treasurer & Vice President","That's what the customers are seeing.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah, the customers for base rates are seeing 0.1%.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. So, on an annualized basis I'm just trying to get to a rough dollar millions number here, okay? I just wanted to sanity check that, because I don't know why I thought it was somewhere in kind of the $30 million to $45 million for WEPCO.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Because you're probably not far off.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay, that's fine. I can follow up offline. Second, on \u2013 when you look at your businesses, electric and gas utilities, do you see when you kind of look out too hard to predict 10 years down the road, but next two years to three years, two years to four years, one side of the business growing faster than the other, meaning electric growing faster than gas or maybe something we haven't seen in a long time, gas growing faster than electric?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, if I were a betting man, I would project that we would see gas \u2013 our gas distribution business growing slightly faster than our electric business for a couple of reasons. One, clearly, just the low price of natural gas; and secondly, the opportunity that we have to continue to gain customers through switching from propane to natural gas. You may have heard me say this before, but the national statistics from a year ago would indicate that Wisconsin is one of the five heaviest using propane states in the United States. And I think there is a tremendous opportunity for customer growth. Forget about per usage customer for a minute, but I think there is a tremendous opportunity for customer growth as we continue to see customers wanting to switch to our natural gas distribution network. In fact, I mentioned in the script, the uptick in customer growth that we are seeing and it's double-digit so far this year compared to the uptick we saw even last year. So to make a long story short, if I were a betting man, I would say, gas grows faster than electric by a bit over the next four years to five years.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","And can you frame for us what percentage of the potential kind of addressable market is actually using propane versus natural gas in Wisconsin?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","The last number I saw, but please don't hold me to this, was that there were a couple of \u2013 somewhere between 220,000 and 250,000 propane users still in the state. Now many of them are in rural areas, where there is not a strong natural gas distribution networks. I don't want to mislead you that a quarter of a million customers could automatically just switch tomorrow to natural gas. But it gives you a sense of what the longer term prospects might look like.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Got it. And finally on electric transmission, you are booking a lower ROE, this isn't a \u2013 you are not booking a charge related to a potential refund, you are booking a \u2013 this is an assumed number up, an ROE percentage that you think will be the adjudicated number that comes out of the MISO case and what you will earn on until whatever future rate filing occurs 5 years or 10 years down the road.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Yeah. You've phrased it exactly correctly.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs & Co.","Okay. Thanks, guys. Much appreciating. Congrats on a good quarter.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Thank you, Michael.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Greetings, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hi. How're you doing?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We're great. How're you doing?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm managing.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Wait a minute. I thought you \u2013 last time you told me you were wonderful and award winning.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I got that, but then I will strive, how about that?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","We appreciate that, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Yeah. I want to follow up on Steve's question on this gas main thing, because just to make sure I understand this. Is the gas \u2013 this accelerated main replacement issue, is that now out of this merger case and in the separate dockets that they opened up because of whistleblowers? So, we are not going to hear about this anymore? Because I'm just trying to \u2013 it seems that the AG's always coming out going back to this thing saying this is some \u2013 she is very upset about it and what have you. So I'm just trying to \u2013 is it out of the case?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I think, well, let me answer it two ways. I think you probably will continue to hear about it, but in terms of technically, the whistleblower letters and the review of the program \u2013 well, let me put it this way. The whistleblower letters and our review of those whistleblower letters and any other investigations that are going on are now part of a separate docket.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Separate and apart from the merger case. But that doesn't mean that someone couldn't inject a discussion about it in our merger case. But it might be helpful, Paul, to clarify for you where we stand in the merger case itself.","In essence, all the hearings have been completed, all the testimony is in, all the briefs are done and we would expect some time in the next few \u2013 certainly in the next couple of weeks, we would expect to see a draft order by the administrative law judge who is hearing the case. So once that draft order is out, then all the parties will have a comment \u2013 will have an opportunity to comment on the draft order, after that then the draft order will go to the commissioners themselves for a final decision. So in terms of evidence, in terms of positions in the case, all of that is basically in the record and the record is now essentially closed other than comments on a draft order, if that's helpful to you.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","That's very helpful. And then so I mean, does the settlement makes sense at this point given how far along everything is?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","At this point, well, this being this close to a draft order, my own view would be the most sensible thing to do is to let the process play out and the process is getting close to the deadline.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","And if you think about sitting here on today we're at May 5, we would be less than 60 \u2013 well, about 60 days away from the statutory deadline for a decision.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And now you've actually seen the Liberty Consulting report which I'm afraid I have not, I guess it's been publicly released now. Is that right? Or it's just you guys who get it. I don't know, because I...","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","I'm not sure that it's been publicly released, but the commission asked or gave us specific authority and all the parties were fine with us reviewing the material in the interim Liberty report and in the draft \u2013 as Allen said, draft final report. So yes, we have seen the review. We have seen the audit.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So you guys are in a great position to answer some of these \u2013 well, I am not going to ask you to go over all of it. But I mean it just this idea that the budget has ballooned according to some of the filings that they are attributing to this program and that it is \u2013 that they are behind schedule and way over budget, I guess, is basically sort of what we are hearing. When you look at it, and knowing what you know about obviously gas utility work and what have you, you guys feel comfortable that this is a program that can be managed and completed in a commercially effective way, is that a good way to put it or do you follow me?","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","Well, let me answer it this way. There are a lot of moving pieces in terms of what the eventual cost might be. But do we believe based on what we've seen that, A, the work is needed; and B, it can be done professionally and in a long-term cost effective way? Yes. But at this point, I don't think it's appropriate for us to comment on what the exact right budget number should be.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","But as we look at the recommendations from the Liberty audit, I mean the recommendations frankly make a great deal of sense. There is nothing in the Liberty audit that I have seen that is troublesome from the standpoint of can we effectively manage the program. I'm confident we can.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Excellent. Thanks so much.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","You're more than welcome.","Gale E. Klappa - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer","All right, ladies and gentlemen, well, I think that concludes our conference call for today. We really appreciate you participating.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management's expectations at the time they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group's latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed financial information is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And now, it is my pleasure to introduce Mr. Allen Leverett, President and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining us today as we review our results for the second quarter. I want to start by introducing the members of our team who are here with me today, Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Bill Guc, Controller; and finally Beth Straka, our Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","Now, as you saw this morning, we reported second quarter 2017 earnings per share of $0.63. Effective cost controls and warmer than normal June weather contributed to a solid second quarter. Scott will provide more detail in a moment.","We are affirming our current 2017 guidance of $3.06 per share to $3.12 per share, with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This is in line with our expected long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.","Now, I would like to update you on our major investments and several developments on the regulatory front. On June 30, we closed the acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding after the Wisconsin Public Service Commission approved the investment. This $230 million investment in natural gas storage will provide approximately one-third of the current storage needs of our Wisconsin Natural Gas Distribution companies.","Bluewater will have a long-term service agreement with each of these three companies. The earnings and risk profile from this investment are expected to be essentially the same as if the storage was owned by our local gas distribution companies. I believe this investment will bring very meaningful benefits to our customers.","You may recall on April 4, we filed a proposed settlement agreement with the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. Now under the terms of the settlement, the currently approved base rates for all of our Wisconsin utilities would be frozen for 2018 and 2019. This would make a total of four years that base rates will be flat, and essentially gives our customers price certainty through 2019. The settlement also requires that we continue to manage our costs aggressively.","Under the proposed agreement, the current earnings sharing mechanisms would be extended through 2019 at Wisconsin Electric and at Wisconsin Gas. In addition, a similar mechanism would be put in place for 2018 and 2019 at Wisconsin Public Service. There would be equal sharing between customers and shareholders of the first 50 basis points of earnings above Wisconsin Public Services' allowed return on equity of 10%. All earnings above 10.5% would go back to benefit customers.","As part of the agreement, we are looking to expand and make permanent some electric pricing options for our large electric customers. These options have helped many of our customers reduce their energy costs, grow their businesses, and create more than 2,000 jobs. These changes will allow us to retain an effective economic development tool and avoid a price increase for customers whose current pricing options would expire under existing terms. The settlement has the support of a board cross-section of our industrial and commercial customers. In addition, state legislative leaders are supportive.","The Commission began consideration of the proposed settlement on April 20. Then on May 25, Wisconsin Commission staff issued a schedule outlining the key dates. On July 19, the Wisconsin Commission staff issued a memorandum in response to our proposed rate-freeze settlement. Staff's review confirmed an electric revenue deficiency, and thus in my view, demonstrated that the settlement we arrived at with our customers remains in the best interest of all of our customers. However, the staff proposed a wide range of conditions to the settlement. Unfortunately, none of these conditions are acceptable to us.","Looking forward from today, comments to the staff memo are due on August 2. Reply comments are due on August 8. We expect the Commission to make a decision on the proposed settlement in the late August to September timeframe. Should the Commission reject the proposed settlement, I expect we will file a traditional rate case.","In Michigan, our proceeding to obtain regulatory approval for the construction of new gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula is progressing well. We anticipate receiving Michigan Commission approval within the 270-day statutory deadline which ends on October 27. In addition, we have received all local approvals needed to accommodate the project. If approved by the Michigan Commission, we expect this to be a $265 million investment.","Turning to Illinois, we continue to make progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization Program. This program is designed to make our gas distribution system in Chicago safer, more reliable and less expensive to maintain. Consistent with our plan, we expect to invest $300 million in the program this year.","Now, a reminder on our dividend. On January 19, our board declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.52 per share, which is an increase of $0.025 or 5.1% over the previous quarterly dividend level. This represents a compound annual growth rate of 6.6% from the 2015 fourth quarter level. Our annualized dividend level stands at $2.08 per share. We continue to target a payout ratio of 65% to 70% of earnings. Given that we are right in this range now, I expect our dividend growth will continue to be in line with our earnings per share growth.","Finally, here in Wisconsin, we're seeing some promising economic activity with state's per capita real GDP is growing faster than the U.S. average. Wisconsin's unemployment rate fell to 3.1% in May, the lowest it has been since 1999 and well below the U.S. average of 4.3%. In Southeastern Wisconsin in particular, there are a number of active ongoing projects. Now with some additional details on our first quarter results and the financial outlook, here's Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Allen. Our 2017 second quarter earnings increased to $0.63 per share from $0.57 per share in the second quarter of 2016. Effective cost controls continued to have a positive impact on earnings. We exceeded our guidance for the second quarter which, as you recall, was $0.56 to $0.60 per share. Lower than expected cost at our Illinois utilities and longer than normal June weather contributed to these results.","The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes a comparison of second quarter and year-to-date 2017 and 2016 results. My focus will be on the quarter beginning with operating income by segment, and then other income, interest expense and income taxes. Referring to page 7 of our earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2017 was $362.2 million as compared to $332.1 million in the second quarter of 2016, an increase of $30.1 million.","Starting with the Wisconsin segment, operating income in the second quarter increased $8.9 million from the second quarter of 2016. On the favorable side, operation and maintenance expense was $29.1 million lower. This was largely offset by lower customer usage related to mild weather conditions in April and May. In the second quarter of 2017, our Illinois segment recognized operating income increase of $18.8 million compared to the second quarter of 2016. The increase was primarily driven by reduced operations and maintenance expense and continued investment in the Gas System Modernization Program. Operating income in our Other segment improved $2.4 million related to lower operations and maintenance expense resulting from cost control measures.","Following last month's acquisition of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, our We Power segment was renamed the Non-Utility Energy segment. For the second quarter, operating income at the Non-Utility Energy segment was up $4.6 million. This increase reflects the additional investment in our Power the Future plan since the second quarter of 2016.","Beginning in the third quarter of 2017, this segment also will include the results of Bluewater. The operating loss at our Corporate and Other segment was $6.2 million for the second quarter of 2017, an increase of $4.6 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Taking the changes of these segments together, we arrive at $30.1 million increase in operating income.","During the second quarter of 2017, earnings from our equity investment in American Transmission Company totaled $41.8 million, an increase of $10.9 million compared to the same period of the prior year. Recall that in the second quarter of 2016, we recognized lower earnings from ATC as a result of the ALJ recommendation related to the FERC ROE reviews.","Other income net decreased by $19.3 million quarter-over-quarter. Driving the decrease was a $19.6 million gain recognized in the second quarter of 2016 from the sale of the chilled water generation and distribution assets of Wisvest. Interest expense increased $1.8 million quarter-over-quarter, driven by lower capitalized interest.","Turning now to consolidated income taxes. We still expect our effective income tax rate will be between 37% and 38% this year. However, our effective tax rate in the second quarter was down 1.8% when compared to the same period last year due largely to the settlement of several items. Combining all of these items brings us to earnings of $199.1 million or $0.63 per share for the second quarter of 2017 compared to $181.4 million or $0.57 per share for the second quarter of 2016.","Net cash provided by operating activities increased $43.9 million during the six months ended June 30, 2017, compared to the same period in the prior year. A reduction in the working capital and higher operating income were partially offset by a $100 million contribution to the pension plan in January 2017.","Looking at the cash flow statement on page 6 of the earnings package. Our capital expenditures totaled $790 million in the first half of 2017, a $171.3 million increase compared to the first half of 2016 as we continue to invest in our core infrastructure. I want to remind you, we also invested $230 million through our acquisition of Bluewater. However, this investment is identified as a separate line on the cash flow statement.","Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 51.5% at the end of June, a decrease from the 51.9% adjusted debt-to-capital ratio at the end of last year. Our calculation continues to treat half the WEC Energy Group 2007 Series A Junior Subordinate Notes as common equity. We're using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401(k) plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","We paid $328.3 million in common dividends during the first six months of 2017, an increase of $15.9 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 5.1% increase in the dividend rate compared to the first half of 2016.","Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 9,000 more electric and 13,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago. Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on page 11 and page 12 of the earnings package respectively.","On a year-to-date basis, weather-normalized sales are adjusted to factor out the effects of leap year in 2016. Overall, normalized sales results for natural gas were above our expectation and retail electric sales were slightly below our expectations.","Turning now to our earnings forecast. As Allen mentioned, we are affirming our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.06 a share to $3.12 a share, with an expectation of being in the upper end of the range. This projection assumes normal weather for the remainder of the year.","Finally, I'd like to address the third quarter earnings per share guidance. As a reminder, during last year's third quarter, we earned $0.68 per share. This included $0.01 of acquisition cost to arrive at adjusted earnings of $0.69 per share. Earnings that quarter were primarily driven by weather that was 43% warmer than normal in Southeastern Wisconsin and related positive fuel recoveries that were partially offset by Wisconsin sharing mechanisms. These items add approximately $0.07 to the quarter of 2016 to arrive at a base of $0.62 per share. Taking these into account, we expect our third quarter 2017 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.63 to $0.67 per share. This assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.","With that, I'll turn things back to Allen.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Scott. Operator, we're now ready for the question-and-answer session portion of our conference call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","All right, thank you. Now, we will take your questions. Your first question comes from Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hello, Greg.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","How are you?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","I just want to understand sort of procedurally what the potential scenarios are at the Commission with regard to the Staffs' suggestions, right? So, they basically said, A, approve the deal as filed, which is clearly your preference. Another one is, reject it and have them file the rate case, which is pretty obvious. But the third path is not so clear to me. If the Commission were to say, we accept the settlement, but imposed the conditions that the Staff had opined be implemented, at that point, could you say, we'd rather file a rate case? Or would you be then compelled to accept that decision?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, we'd not be compelled to accept the decision, so maybe just to state for everybody on the call to make sure they understand your question. So basically, you have a scenario, Greg, where the Commission says well, all right, we accept the settlement subject to the addition of some or all of the conditions that the Commission staff propose, so that's the hypothetical scenario.","Well, in that scenario, given the way the settlement was structured, it's not severable. So if it's not accepted in whole, well, the settlement basically falls away unless we and the other parties who came up with the settlement, unless we all agree to a different set of conditions. So, we wouldn't be compelled, Greg, in the scenario you lay out to accept that modified settlement, if you will. And as I described in the opening remarks, the next step would be, we'd file a general rate case.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. That's what I thought. I just wanted to hear you state that so that it was clear because looking at the conditions, they were clearly put \u2013 they seem to, at least some of them, put a lot more pressure on unit control costs by virtue of not allowing you under certain of those conditions to continue to defer costs and by reducing the amount you could earn on significant regulatory asset balances, right? So, it would seem to me that unless you had \u2013 were able to pull off some herculean effort vis-\u00e0-vis cost cutting, there would be the potential for some significant regulatory lag under that scenario. Is that fair?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. I agree with that description.","Greg Gordon - Evercore ISI","Okay. That was my only question. Thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Greg.","Operator","Your next question comes from Larry Liou with JPMorgan.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, Larry.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Hey, good afternoon, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Can you just touch quickly on how you plan to address the ratings pressure at Moody's?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I'll let Scott talk about \u2013 and I think Larry's question is about the recent action that Moody's took and whether we have any actions that we would plan in response to that. Is that fair, Larry?","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Yes. Exactly.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","So, just to remind everyone, Moody's at our Wisconsin utilities moved them down one notch from A1 to A2 and they described several reasons and one of them is the recovery of some of the regulatory items and not having riders compared to other jurisdictions. With that, now they've put our holding company on a negative watch or outlook also. We're continuing to monitor our holding company debt to total debt, and that's one of the items I think they'd like to see that come back a little faster than we've reduced it. However, as we continue to find good investments such as the Bluewater investment, that will add some stress to the holding company, but it's good for the customers and good for the shareholders as it continues to improve earnings. So we're monitoring that holding company debt and as you can tell, watching our financials as tight as possible.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. And I guess just on Bluewater, can you just remind us how you financed the acquisition again?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. So, the way it'll be financed, Larry, initially of course, we'd just take down commercial paper at the holding company to fund the $230 million acquisition price. $115 million or roughly half of the investment down at the sub will be equity and then another $115 million will be non-recourse debt, meaning non-recourse to the holding company debt down at the Bluewater Holding level.","And then so we'll take $115 million from that financing and pay down some holding company debt. But the holding company is essentially funding its equity contribution, if you will, into the subsidiary with debt up at the holding company.","Larry Liou - JPMorgan Securities LLC","Okay. Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Shar Pourreza with Guggenheim Partners.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hello, Shar.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Hey, everyone. Hey, Allen and Scott. How are you?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Just one question, with the Bluewater acquisition, you're kind of sort of chipping away at some incremental growth opportunities that can help you maybe get you above the bottom end of your range. Is there sort of any updates on additional growth opportunities you're kind of working on, maybe the Arizona opportunities or additional storage assets, anything that could help get you above?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. Thanks for the question. And I guess we \u2013 in the November, actually early November timeframe, probably around the EEI Finance Conference, we'd provide a complete update on our five-year capital plan. So, I don't have any incremental update today. But what I would say is I'm feeling very optimistic about additional opportunities. Some of those kind of in the areas that you were alluding to in your question, in the midstream natural gas assets where we would purchase assets that we could either financially or physically integrate with our natural gas distribution company. So, feel optimistic, but what I'd rather do is really provide a complete update and a five-year plan in early November.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","That's super-helpful. Just for \u2013 I think we've talked about sensitivity purposes. Roughly what is it, the capital program, around $1.5 billion over a five-year period could equate to about 1% incremental growth?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. Yes. Just to be clear. So, if you look over a five-year plan and you invest $1.6 billion of capital and let's assume that that's levered 50\/50, so, 50% equity, 50% debt and then you earn approximately a 10% return on the equity piece. You're exactly right, that would add 1 percentage point to the five-year compound annual growth in EPS.","Shahriar Pourreza - Guggenheim Securities LLC","Terrific. Good results, guys. Thanks.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc Capital Markets.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hello, Paul.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Good afternoon. How are you?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Just did you book any FERC ROE complaint, reserves, or refunds in this quarter?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","No, it was \u2013 the entry we talked about in the prepared comments was in 2016.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","And did you quantify that?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","So, this \u2013 I don't know the exact dollar amount. It had to be around $8 million, I'm assuming, $8 million to $9 million.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Pre-tax?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Pre-tax.","Paul T. Ridzon - KeyBanc Capital Markets, Inc.","Okay. Thank you very much.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from Paul Patterson with Glenrock Associates.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Hello, Paul.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Hey, how are you doing?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I'm good. How are you?","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","I'm managing. I just wanted to sort of follow up on Paul Ridzon's question there. The ROE, just if you could break it down for me. It seems like the FERC transmission impact seems a lot more this quarter than last quarter. If you could just walk me through why it's so much more?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. I mean, it's a good question. Last year in the second quarter, the ALJ came out with their decision to, for their second case, to have the FERC ROE was at \u2013 for the second case at 10.2%. Now remember that's 9.7% plus a 50 basis point adder to 10.2%. And that time, then we looked at the complaint period and took an entry in that quarter to record that reserve to that 10.2%.","Since then, in September of last year, the FERC came out with their decision in the first case that was at a 10.82% ROE, which is a 10.32%, plus a 50 basis point adder to the 10.82%. And since the end of September, we've been booking at that 10.82% until we'll hear on that second complaint. And the second complaint, we're waiting for a quorum now at FERC. We don't know what they'll be in the second half of the year, but currently, we're booking at the 10.82%.","So, the main driver, the swing between quarters there was the entry last year to get down to the first reserve needed. And it may be a little bit higher too because we're booking at a 10.82%. But long-term in our financial plan, we talk about a 10.2% long-term outlook for the FERC ROE.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. And then, in terms of the lower O&M. I was just wondering if you could break it out a little bit more in Illinois. I apologize if I just missed this, but between that and the continued SMP, and just where the other O&M savings are showing up?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","All right. Well, I think \u2013 let me let Scott maybe give you some color on Illinois, Paul. But maybe just to kind of reground everybody on our O&M plan for the year. So, the goal at an enterprise level was to reduce O&M 3% in 2017 as compared to the actual run rate of O&M \u2013 controlled O&M in 2016. And as I look at the Wisconsin utilities for the year, we've got some timing of O&M expenditures that were moved around because we had to respond to the warmer than normal weather in the first quarter. There's also going to be some downstream O&M effects of the storms that we had that affected the electric business in Wisconsin in the second quarter.","But overall, my expectation is that those Wisconsin utilities will be right on top of that 3%. But in Illinois, we're actually doing better than plan on O&M. So, Scott, do you want to give Paul some additional color on that?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. So, Illinois, the drivers \u2013 it's a combination of, like you said, the O&M and the rider. I would say probably about $8 million to $10 million of that variance year-to-date is related to the QIP rider, the capital investment, plus some other riders that are just a pass-through of O&M. But O&M is the major driver in there. And that's the majority of the remaining of it, I'd say $10 million to $15 million, plus some other lower interest expenses.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Great. And then just back to the settlement, it seems that when you read the staff, it seems to be saying sort of two different things. On the one hand, it seems to be saying what you just mentioned, which was that they would calculate \u2013 they think it's likely that there'll be a revenue deficiency. But I guess they also start talking about the ROE and how that could maybe change a few things if that was changed. And then they also discussed the concern that they apparently have about rate increases in the future because of the deferrals. And based on what I'm hearing from what you're saying, it looks like \u2013 unless the Commission is okay with these deferrals growing that you probably have to go in for a rate case. Is that right?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, let's just make sure that we're clear on the financial effect that our proposal would have. Our proposal if it were the settlement \u2013 okay, just to be \u2013 so the settlement that we entered into with our customers, if that were implemented, if you look at the projected balances, if you look at where we expect to be at the end of 2017 and look at where we would expect those balances to be at the end of 2019 if they adopted the settlement. I mean if you look end to end, Paul, we would expect there to be no growth on a net basis in those deferred balances. So we'd sort of de-level 2019 year-end versus 2017 year-end, so we wouldn't have any additional accumulation of balances and the hope that we have is that with tax reform that then you will start having some uplift, if you will, or a cost reduction effectively that you could use to start managing those balances down. But if you look at during the pendency of the rate freeze period that we proposed in the settlement, there wouldn't be any net growth at all in those balances.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","So, when the Commission Staff says that their analysis suggests that the approach that you guys are proposing could result in a new deferred balance, if you were to put that new deferred balance with respect to the legacy deferred balances, for lack of a better term, you'd still basically be net no change in the deferred balance at 2019, is that correct?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Right, out to 2019, that's correct.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I mean, we do have some deferred balances that relates to deferred taxes. But once again, we won't collect that from the customers. We'll collect that when we pay it back to the government which will be approximately a 50-year period on these taxes.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","And is that what the Commission's referring to with respect to the staff referring to when they talk about the results of a new deferred \u2013 any new deferred balance?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","I think that's what they're referring to is the tax deferred balance.","Paul Patterson - Glenrock Associates LLC","Okay. Okay. Thank you so much.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thanks, Paul.","Operator","Your next question comes from Dan Jenkins, State of Wisconsin Investment Board.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Good afternoon, Dan.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Hi, good afternoon. So, first I just wanted to follow up a little bit on the earlier discussion around the Moody's downgrade. Just wondering, so do you have, say, a ratings target or a leverage target for your balance sheet at both the pairing in at the utilities at a point where you manage towards or the \u2013 a lot level you would defend the rating?","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. When we look at our utilities, we want to keep all the utilities in that single-A rated category. So, they moved a little bit within the category with Moody's now and we did try to defend it to keep it up to that level because we know the cheaper interest is always good for our customers. So, we want to keep in that single-A rated category.","At the holding company, right now it's on a negative watch. It potentially could move down a little bit and we're going to continue to monitor that. If it does move down a notch, I mean that's where we'll really continue to look at our holding company debt and manage that.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes, I think one of the focuses, Dan, that we've had for quite a while is managing the percentage that holding company debt represents as a proportion of consolidated debt. And so, we've certainly taken a number of actions this year to keep that within the balance that we like it to be. We did permanent non-recourse financings at Michigan Gas Utilities as well as MERC over in Minnesota at the gas utility there.","And I mentioned the financing that we would plan later this year at Bluewater. So I think all of those has been and will be helpful, and also managing that holding company debt to consolidated debt percentage within a reasonable range.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. Then I also was wondering on page 7 where you show the comparisons from this year to last year. You also had a $4.6 million difference in the corporate and other category. I was wondering if you could give a little more color on what was driving that change.","Scott J. Lauber - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. There's a lot of little variety of items in that segment there. Just one item and this is kind of inside baseball. But we had some investments that were at the service company that really belong more at the utilities. So, we put the investments in the utilities versus the service company. Their earnings stayed the same, their capital stayed the same, it's just once again, it took \u2013 just moved it into the utility where it belongs. Some of those were still there last year at the acquisition. It's just kind of the cleanup of what we think is the best way to run the service company. So, just a variety of little items.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. And then the last question I had is, there's been some speculation and later today, there'll be an announcement of a large Foxconn facility in Southeastern Wisconsin. And I don't want you to spill the beans or steal the thunder there, but there's been talk about a site where there was an old Chrysler engine plant or whatever. I just wondered if you could confirm whether that site is in your service territory.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Yes. The site that I believe you're referencing is in our service territory, unless they are (36:50) service territory that the electric service territory for Wisconsin Electric. And I'm sure, Dan, we've both read some of the same reports in the press. Certainly Governor Walker has been in detailed discussions with the senior people at Foxconn. Foxconn has indicated that they'll be making a decision soon. But at this point, they haven't made a formal announcement. But what I would say, Dan, the investment that's being discussed would be quite significant for the economy here in Wisconsin.","Dan Jenkins - State of Wisconsin Investment Board","Okay. That's all I had. Thank you.","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Thank you, Dan.","Operator","Your next question comes from Joe Zuho (37:48) with Avon Capital Advisors.","Allen L.

Okay, real quick, because I know everybody wants to get off the call. I'm probably the last question. So, just to understand, you were very clear on the settlement, it's all or nothing. But I had this one question on that. Have you spoken to the people or the other organizations that are in the settlement with you? Are they on the same page there or is there a little bit of wiggle room between you and the settlement parties and the Commission?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","We have had, Andy. From time to time, we've had discussions, sort of updates, if you will, with the other parties to the settlement. And they really have the same view that I have. This is a settlement that \u2013 it was highly negotiated between the folks in the settlement and it's not severable. I mean, they view it as a package and we view it as a package, Andy.","Andrew Levi - Avon Capital\/Millennium","Okay. So, it really is all or nothing?","Allen L. Leverett - WEC Energy Group, Inc.","Well, we have a package that we and our customers think they're in the best interest of all the customers.

A replay of our remarks will be available later today.","And now it's my pleasure to introduce Mr. Gale E. Klappa, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of Wisconsin Energy Corporation.","Gale E. Klappa","Colleen, thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us as we review our 2014 second quarter results. Let me begin, as always, by introducing the members of the Wisconsin Energy management team who are here with me today. We have Allen Leverett, President of Wisconsin Energy and CEO of our Generation Group; Pat Keyes, our Chief Financial Officer; Susan Martin, General Counsel; Steve Dickson, Controller; and Scott Lauber, our Treasurer.","Pat will review our financial results in detail in just a moment. But as you saw from our news release this morning, we reported earnings of $0.58 a share for the second quarter of 2014. This compares with earnings of $0.52 a share for last year's second quarter. Despite a cool and a rainy June that significantly reduced customer demand, we delivered solid results. And I must add that cost related to our acquisition of Integrys Energy Group reduced earnings by a penny a share during the quarter.","Turning now to the state of the economy, Wisconsin unemployment rate declined to 5.7% in June and remains well below the national average, the unemployment rate in Wisconsin is now the lowest it\u2019s been since 2008. (inaudible) broader economic backdrop deliveries of electricity to our large commercial and industrial customers excluding the iron ore mines rose by 2.1% in the second quarter. We saw strength in several sectors including paper manufacturing, food products, rubber and plastics and primary metals.","In addition, we continue to see stronger customer growth across our system. The electric service connections are up by 3.6% and the new natural gas installations are up 8.5% compared with the same period year. These gains reflect a bit stronger economy and the volume of customer switching from propane to natural gas.","Later in my prepared remarks, I will update you on several positive developments in our core business as well as the progress we are making on the important construction projects we have underway. But first I would like to touch on our recent announcement to acquire Integrys Energy Group.","Just to refresh your memory on June 23rd, we announced plans to acquire Integrys in a cash and stock transaction. Combing the two companies to form the WEC Energy Group will create a strong electric and natural gas delivery company with deep operational expertise scale and financial resources to meet the region\u2019s future energy needs.","We will be serving 4.3 million customers in Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and Minnesota in fact the combination will create the eight largest natural gas distribution company in America and the strong cash flow of the combined company will be prudently invested in new and upgraded energy infrastructure.","Now as you well aware, we have consistently used three criteria to evaluate any potential acquisition. First, we would have believed that the acquisition would be accretive to earnings per share in the first full calendar year after closing. Second, it would need to be largely credit neutral and finally we would have to believe there is a long term growth rate of any acquisition would be at least equal the Wisconsin Energy\u2019s standalone growth rate. I am pleased to reiterate with you that we believe this combination meets or exceeds all three criteria.","We expect the combined company will be able to grow earnings per share at 5% to 7% per year faster than either one of us projecting on a standalone basis. And importantly more than 99% of these earnings would come from regulated businesses.","Our customers will benefit from the operational efficiency that comes with an increased scale and geographic proximity and over the time will enhance the operations of the seven utilities that will be part of our energy group by incorporating best practices system-wide.","In addition, as many of you know Integrys today is one of the major owners of American transmission company with a 34.1% interest, Wisconsin Energy is the second largest owner with a 26.2% interest. The combined entity will have a 60% stake and what is the largest independent transmission company in the country.","As you may remember, ATC\u2019s ten year plan calls for investing between $3 billion to $3.6 billion, the bolster electric reliability in our region, it\u2019s a solid plan and we welcome the opportunity to increase our commitment.","Now in light of the acquisition, we have terminated our share repurchase program. The Integrys transaction will allow us to use our strong cash flow will allow us to use our strong cash flow for regulated investments. The proposed dividend policy of the combined company will be designed to keep Integrys shareholders neutral initially after taking into consideration both the stock and cash they will receive.","In the period before closing, Wisconsin Energy plans to continue with its current dividend policy and of course that policy calls for 7% to 8% annual increase in our dividend.","At closing, we would expect a further dividend increase for Wisconsin Energy shareholders to reflect the dividend policy of the combined company. Then going forward, projected payout target for the combined company will be 65% to 70% of earnings","The transaction of course is subject to approvals from the shareholders of both companies and several regulatory agencies. The agencies include the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Communications' Commission, the Public Service Commissions of Wisconsin and Michigan, the Illinois Commerce Commission and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. The transaction is also subject to the requirements of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act and other customary closing conditions. We planned to file for approval of the acquisition in each of the four states next week. Filings at the Federal level are expected to be made before the end of August. We anticipate closing the transaction sometime during the second half of 2015.","Also you may have seen the announcement this morning from Integrys and Exelon, Exelon\u2019s constellation business unit has agreed to purchase Integrys unregulated power and natural gas marketing business. Exelon will pay $60 million for the Integrys retail operations plus adjusted networking capital at the time of closing. That working capital was about $183 million as of May 31 2014. The Integrys management team plans to provide you with an update during their quarterly earnings call which is now scheduled for August 7.","Again, we believe our combination with Integrys will create the premiere regulated utility system in the Midwest with superior service and competitive pricing for years to come, the benefits to all stakeholders and the customers and communities we serve to the people we employ, to the shareholders who count on us to create value, our clear compelling and achievable.","And now turning back to recent developments in Wisconsin Energy core business. On July 18, we have received the final written order from the Wisconsin commission approving our request to build and operate a new natural gas lateral in the west central Wisconsin. This 85 mile pipeline and connected facilities will run from northern Eau Claire County from the far western part of the state to the city of Tomah in west central Wisconsin. The project will address reliability concerns in region and meet growing demand.","Demand of course has been driven by customers converting from propane to natural gas and by the growth of the sand mining industry in western Wisconsin. The commission\u2019s approval also includes franchise awards for ten communities along the route and authorizes us to begin delivering natural gas within the borders of those ten communities. We expect to begin construction early next year on the project and complete the entire project in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our projected cost is between $175 million and $185 million excluding allowance for funds used during constructions.","On the generation side of our business, you will recall that we are converting the fuel source for our valley power plant from coal to natural gas, the two unit valley plant the cogeneration facility located along the Menomonee River near downtown Milwaukee. Valley generates electricity for the grid, produces steam for more than 400 customers in the downtown Milwaukee business center and provides voltage support for our electric distribution network. I am pleased to report to you that the unit one conversion is now well under way. We stopped using coal at the unit in mid July and our scheduled calls for start-up and boiler tuning to begin in October in advance of course of the winter heating season. We plan to have unit one fully converted into natural gas by the end of the year. Valley would be available to operate at full power this winter with the unit one burning natural gas and unit two continuing to burn coal. Unit two is then scheduled to be converted to natural gas during 2015. We expect the total conversion cost to be $65 million to $70 million again excluding allowance for funds used during construction.","Now you may recall that in March of last year, we also began the major upgrade of the existing natural gas pipeline that runs near the Valley facility. This pipeline replacement project has an estimated cost of approximately $30 million and is on time and on budget.","Converting Valley to natural gas will reduce our operating cost and enhance the environmental performance of the units. We expect the electric capacity of the plant to remain at 280 megawatts and we believe our plan will help support a vibrate downtown Milwaukee for many years to come.","Next, I would like to touch on the upgrade of our Twin Falls hydroelectric plant. Twin Falls was built way back in 1912 and it's one of 13 hydroelectric plants on our system. The plant is located on the boarder of Wisconsin and Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula. Construction is underway now to build the new powerhouse and spillway capacity that meets current Federal standards.","Since our last updates, we began major construction work which includes building cofferdams and test blasting to prepare for rock excavation. These activities are scheduled for completion later this year; we expect that the new powerhouse will be operational in 2015. We plan to remove the old powerhouse during 2016. The total investment is budgeted at $60 million to $65 million again excluding allowance for funds used during constructions.","We are also making just excellent progress on our fuel flexibility initiative at the Oak Creek expansion units. As you recall, these units were originally permitted to burn bituminous coal. However, given the current cost differential between bituminous coal and Powder River Basin coal, blending the two types of fuel could save our customers $25 million to $50 million a year depending on the mix.","Last year we received environmental permits began making changes to the boilers and testing of blend of bituminous and Powder River Basin coal at the plant. And just a few weeks ago on July 7, we took the next step and filed the request with the Wisconsin Commission to approve $25 million of additional capital spending for modifications at the plant. If approved, these modifications will enable testing of up to 100% PRB coal. However, I should point out that to operate the units above at 20% PRB blend on a sustain basis further investment will be needed in fuel storage and handling equipment. Just the reminder, our end goal is to have the flexibility at the new Oak Creek units to increase the percentage of Powder River Basin coal up to 100%.","Next, I would like to discuss the investment opportunities that we see as we focus on delivering the future. As we have previously reported to you, our capital budget calls for spending between $3.2 billion and $3.5 billion over the five year period between now and 2018. In this five year budget, the nature of our capital spending is shifting away from large projects such as our power the future units, renewable generation of larger quality controls. Instead our capital plan is comprised of many smaller projects that will continue to improve our generation and upgrade our aging distribution networks, over the next five years will have a much greater focus on pipes, polls, wires, transformers, and sub-stations, the building blocks of our delivery business.","The primary risk associated with these projects are naturally more manageable even with the smaller scale and scope of the distribution work but this work is no less valuable or important than the mega projects we have completed in recent years. Our focus on renewing our distribution network is essential to maintaining our status is one of the most reliable utilities in America. So we will keep you posted as these needed infrastructure projects move forward.","We are also monitoring another investment opportunity, the potential sale of the State of Wisconsin generation plants. Last year, you will recall Governor Walker signed in the law a new state budget. That budget includes a provision expanding the state\u2019s authority to sell or lease certain state on properties. This means that the administration has the authority to pursue the sale of the state's electric, steam and chilled water generation and distribution facilities. Financial advisors have now been selected by the state and an asset broker has been named for the potential sale of the plants. No formal timetable has yet been announced but if the sale does take place, we expect that would occur in 2015.","Turning now to Wisconsin regulatory matters, in May we reached the rate settlement facilitated by the Wisconsin Commission staff with three major customer groups, the settlement covers return on equity, capital structure and base rate changes for the forward looking test years 2015 and 2016. If approved by the Wisconsin Commission, Wisconsin Electric will have a return on equity of 10.2% with no change and its capital structure. Wisconsin Gas will have a return on equity of 10.3% with a higher equity component in its capital structure. The equity midpoint for Wisconsin thus would increase from 47.5% to 49.5%.","Based on the settlement nonfuel electric rates will increase by 1.4% beginning in 2015, we expect these changes to be effective on January 1st. During the final months of this year, the remainder of the rate case will focus on rate design and on 2015 fuel cost recovery and with that \u2013 with that long update I would be happy to turn the things over to our Chief Financial Officer Pat Keyes, who will provide you more details on our second quarter results, Pat?","James Patrick Keyes","Thank you, Gale. As Gale mentioned, our 2014 second quarter earnings were $0.58 a share as compared with $0.52 a share for the corresponding quarter in 2013. Cost related to the acquisition of Integrys Energy reduced earnings by $0.01 per share in the second quarter.","Now consistent with past practice, I will discuss operating income for our business segments and then discuss other income, interest expense and income taxes.","Our consolidated operating income for the second quarter was $240.7 million as compared with $229.5 million in 2013. That's an increase of $11.2 million. Starting with the utility energy segment, operating income in the second quarter totaled $155.2 million for 2014, an increase of $16.3 million over the second quarter of 2013.","On a quarter-over-quarter basis, utility operations and maintenance cost declined by $40 million primarily because of lower medical, pension and other post employment benefit costs. Our earnings were also helped by $13.8 million related to the accounting on the treasury grant for our new biomass plant.","Our second quarter 2014 earnings were hurt by a cool west spring, we estimate that our electric and gas margins declined by $5 million as a result of the weather. We also saw increased depreciation cost of $4.6 million primarily because of the biomass plant that was placed on a service in the fourth quarter of 2013.","Combining these and other factors results in a $16.3 million increase in utility operating income in the second quarter of 2014 as compared with the same quarter in the prior year.","Operating income in our nonutility segment was $91.7 million which is right in line with the prior year. Our corporate and other segment which includes corporate costs and smaller affiliates recorded $5.2 million with an increased cost in the second quarter of 2014 as compared to the second quarter 2013. The increased costs are directly related to the proposed acquisition of the Integrys Group. Taking the changes for these segments together, you arrive at the $11.2 million increase in operating income.","During the second quarter, earnings from our investment in the American transmission company totaled $17.5 million, an increase of $200,000 over the same period last year. These earnings are in line with our expectation. Our other income net increased by $2.3 million.","During the second quarter 2014 we\u2019ve recognized gains in the sale of property in our west part subsidiary and land sales in the utility.","Our net interest expense decreased by $4.3 million primarily because of lower debt levels and more average interest rates. Over the past year, we were able to issue long-term debt at interest rates at the lower than the maturing debt.","Consolidated income tax expense rose by $4 million because of higher pretax earnings partially offset by a slightly lower tax rate for the quarter. Our effective tax rate for 2014 is expected to be between 37.5% and 38.5%. Combining all of these items brings you to $133 million of net income for the first second quarter 2014 or earnings of $0.58 per share. Again, these earnings include just over a penny of cost associated with the acquisition of Integrys.","During the first six months of 2014, our operating cash flows totaled $721.3 million which is a $39.8 million increase from the first six months of 2013. We have collected $76.2 million this year related to the treasury grant. This benefit was partially offset by higher working capital requirements.","Our capital expenditures totaled $305.5 million in the first six months of 2014; $1.8 million decrease compared it to 2013.","Our adjusted debt-to-capital ratio was 50.8% at the end of June. Our calculation to reach half of our hybrid securities is common equity which is consistent with past presentations. Earlier in the year, we projected that our year-end debt-to-total capital will be relatively flat with our 2013 year-end ratio of 52.5%.","Now with the termination of share repurchase program, we expect to see our year end debt to total capital below to last year's ratio. We continue to use cash to satisfy any shares required for 401-K plan, options and other programs. We also paid $176 million in common dividends in the first six months of 2014, an increase of $20.4 million over the same period last year. Dividends for 2014 equate to an annual rate of $1.56 per share.","Retail deliveries of electricity rose by 3% in the first half of 2014 as compared to first half of 2013. Our normalized first half deliveries were up by 2.3%. Looking at the individual customer segments, we saw actual residential deliveries up 1.2% on a normalized basis which were flat with 2013.","Across our small commercial industrial group, we saw year-to-date deliveries up 9% to 10%, another normalized basis, we were down two times of percent. In the large commercial industrial segment on a normalized basis, deliveries for the first half of 2014 were up by 6.6%. And if you exclude the iron ore mines we were up 2%. Overall these results are in line with our expectations.","First half retail natural gas sales were up 13.8% compared to the first half of 2013. On a normalized basis, sales improved by 2.5%. Results from our natural gas delivery business are ahead of our expectations for the year.","Moving to other items of interest, in May of 2014 our electric subsidiary issued a $250 million, 30 year bond at a coupon of 4.25%. This bond is essentially replaced by $300 million bond with a coupon of 6% that came due in April.","Turing now to our earnings forecast. We are maintaining our 2014 guidance of $2.58 a share to $2.64 a share. Our 2014 guidance excludes cost related to the Integrys acquisition. While our results for the first half of the year exceeded our expectations, we have had a very cool summer. As many of you know we typically see our largest cooling demand during the warm summer days of July.","However, we only have had four July since 1960 that have been cooler than the July of 2014. In fact Milwaukee has not seen a single 90 degree day this summer. So taking into account this cool July weather and looking at the continued cool forecast in August our third quarter guidance is $0.48 a share to $0.50 a share. This too excludes cost associated with the Integrys acquisition.","Our third quarter guidance also reflects lower fuel recoveries as compared to the same quarter in 2013. These are largely timing issues that were factored into our 2014 fuel plant. So again, the range for our third quarter guidance is $0.48 a share to $0.50 a share and with that I will turn things back to Gale.","Gale E. Klappa","Pat, thank you very much let me zip up my parka before we go into the Q&A. Overall folks were on track and focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders.","Question-And-Answer Session","Operator","Now we would like to take your questions. [Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Greg Gordon with ISI Group. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa","Rock and roll Greg how are you?","Greg Gordon - ISI Group","I am doing great, Gale. How are you?","Gale E. Klappa","We are good.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.","So one question you may not be able to answer but the Integrys announced the sale of their retail business -- the press release hit last night. I know you are at arm\u2019s length on that when you look at the price that was announced, was that consistent with your understanding of the economics? Does it has anything to do \u2013 affect in any way the economics of your transaction or was it in line with your expectations?","Gale E. Klappa","Greg, very good question, certainly. In my conversations with my counterpart of Integrys we were supportive of the sale and the results as you saw published this morning in the new release were quite consistent with our expectations.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.","Great and I have a couple of questions that are probably CFO level questions. When I look at the revenues you have generated year-to-date from the different customer classes, electric revenues look more or less consistent in residential small commercial is the same as large commercial industrial is obviously down on bunch unrealized revenue and then it's more than offset by significant improvements in resell and other, so an you talk about what is driving that shift and how we should think about that prospectively?","Gale E. Klappa","Well, Pat and Scott are thinking, are you saying that those questions are above or below my pay-grade, which?","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.","Yes, the answer is yes.","James Patrick Keyes","Greg, Scott and me take team a little bit. But to get the \u2013 we talked in the first couple calls about opportunity of sales and if you look at the year-to-date we did quite well in the beginning of the year. And that's certainly driving a part of it and Scott do you want to add color to that at all or?","Scott Lauber","Yes the opportunity of sales are there but also on our other operating revenues we have the payment with the SSR payments for (inaudible) power plant.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.","Okay and the large commercial industrial falloff is the iron ore mines?","James Patrick Keyes","On the sales side, yes. That\u2019s why we kind of with the mine decision last year we started reporting both sales and deliveries. So with the mines decision the sales numbers will fall commensurately but we kept the delivery numbers there so you kind of have an apples to apples to prior year on how much we are delivering.","Gale E. Klappa","The sales would include the generation side of the business; deliveries because we are still delivering electricity of the mines would include just total deliveries to all of our customers.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.","Understood and then the treasury grants are significant portion of your earnings contribution this year. Is the way that's going to work is when the plant comes up and running, treasury grants are going to sort of stop coming in but the plant will actually start earning and so you won\u2019t see any significant sort of fluctuation in earnings. How is that going to work? ","Gale E. Klappa","That one is not below my pay grade so let me give you the facts on that and then Steve Dickson can help me if there is anything obscure. But essentially last year while the plant was under contraction, we were delivering the customer\u2019s bill credits from the Federal tax grant that we expected to receive from the treasury department for building a biomass unit. Where the accounting rules worked, we basically took a three center share hit because we were actually paying cash credit on bills to customers in each of the first three quarters of 2013. So $0.03 in each of those three quarters, then when the plant went commercial, we completed the plant on time and on budget and brought it into service in November of last year, under the accounting rules we were able to book the grant. So there was a true up in Q4 of last year if you will, I think it was $0.09 pickup Steven in Q4 of last year. So forwarding that Greg, to our second quarter results this year, we didn't have any negative impact from the bill credits and we did last year. So we had three cent a share pick up in Q2 of this year because of the accounting rules compared to Q2 of last year. Am I making sense Greg?","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.","Hundred percent and how long do those treasury grant run through the P&L?","Gale E. Klappa","I think two years.","Steve Dickson","Yes in the right case we are going to give back to Wisconsin customers over a two year period and that will end in December of 2014. ","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.","Got you and so it will all come out in the wash so to speak when you do your rate design in new requirements for the next \u2013","Gale E. Klappa","Absolutely. This will all come up -- this will all be completed basically before the new effective test year of January 2015.","Greg Gordon - ISI Group Inc.","Completely understood. Thank you.","Gale E. Klappa","You are welcome, Greg. Good questions.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Kit Konolige with BGC. Please go ahead with your question.","Kit Konolige \u2013 BGC","Hi. Good afternoon guys.","Gale E. Klappa","How are you doing Kit?","Kit Konolige - BGC","Good. So just pretty simple old fashioned utility kind of question. So you have indicated that your level of sales was in line with expectations. So it looks like residential sales are kind of flat, flat to down for the first half or they were down in the first quarter and flat in the second?","Gale E. Klappa","Yes?","Kit Konolige - BGC","So what are you seeing there, I mean we have seen there is some other companies, is this any further deterioration in kind of customer usage by customer or just efficiency better refrigerators or tightness in spending on electricity because of the economy or what do we think is going on out there?","Gale E. Klappa","We thought about this profoundly and I think it's not enough beer in the refrigerator yet.","Kit Konolige - BGC","That\u2019s a big problem in your service territory.","Gale E. Klappa","Exactly. Well I will give you my view for what it\u2019s worth. First of all, when you look at our first half, I think it's fair to say that when you compare it to our projection for the year we were expecting retail sales in total to be up about one-half of 1%. But then when you break that down by customer group, large industrial, well actually I think did a little better than expectations both in Q1 and Q2 from industrial demand for electricity and I think we were up 2% Scott in Q1 compared to the first quarter year ago on industrial demand for electricity and 2.1% second quarter compared to Q2 of a year ago.","So, again breaking down our kind of expectations better than we thought on industrial demand. When you look at small commercial and industrial, maybe a little less than we thought, it's pretty flat and then on residential it's flat, however, that\u2019s on a weather normal basis. And again we had such abnormal weather in the first quarter that I think you have to just take for now our weather normalization with the grain of salt.","Remember we have talked before Kit that when weather gets beyond the second standard deviation from normal, the industry's weather normalization techniques tend to break down. So I wouldn't read too much into it one way or another. The only I think interesting and perhaps hopeful fact coming out of the first half numbers for us in terms of demand for electricity as the uptake from industrial customers. Scott do you like?","Scott Lauber","Yes, that\u2019s correct.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Sounds good. Okay just one other area for me and that is I might have missed some of this but what\u2019s the schedule for the state sale of generation?","Gale E. Klappa","There have been no formal announcement of the schedule yet, however the state has hired both financial advisors and the broker and they have made that announcement just in the last probably I believe in June. So if there is a sale going forward of state assets we would expect that to be a 2015 event.","Kit Konolige - BGC","That would be 2015, when would you expect to hear from the state or to see it published whether they are or aren\u2019t going ahead with it?","Gale E. Klappa","Again there\u2019ve been no real indications from the state other than the fact that they believe they\u2019ve made a major step forward in terms of interviewing and hiring specific financial advisors and a broker. Now one complicating factor is that they really are looking at the potential sale of a number of different types of properties though they have hired financial advisors for each type of property as well broker for the potential sale of the plants themselves.","So they are really trying to organize a much broader potential sale of property than just the power plant themselves.","Kit Konolige - BGC","Very good. Okay. Thank you very much.","Gale E. Klappa","You are welcome Kit. I appreciate your call.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa","How is Cleveland Paul?","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Cleveland rocks.","Gale E. Klappa","Alright, I wonder that happened, I am sorry go ahead Paul.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Last year you did $0.60 in the third you and now you are guiding it down $0.11 to midpoint despite the $0.03 pick up from the tax. Can you just run through the big drivers is it all weather, sorry if I missed that?","Gale E. Klappa","It\u2019s really two things and Pat can elaborate if he would like to it\u2019s really weather? We\u2019ll its four things, the first three are weather. I mean literally this has been one of the coldest Julys on record in Wisconsin. I think Pat mentioned in his portion of the prepared remarks, the weather forecast was saying we will not have a single 90 degree day this entire summer in Wisconsin. I\u2019m figuring if this continues Paul we\u2019re going to be at 30 below in October. I mean really it has been incredibly cool and honest to goodness the weather forecast for August looks to be a repeat of July in terms of way colder than normal. So we\u2019ve tried to take into account what we know has occurred in July which is just incredible lack of demand for air conditioning for obvious reasons and extrapolate that to August and then of course there is some timing Pat on fuel recovery.","James Patrick Keyes","That's right, Gale. Does that answer your question Paul I can dive in more if you like but that's \u2013 I think that\u2019s the bulk of it.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","How big is the fuel piece?","James Patrick Keyes","Round numbers $0.02, $0.03.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","Okay and then just kind of assuming you close Integrys, you own 60% of ATC, how will that pull to your income statement at that point?","Gale E. Klappa","I will ask Alan to answer that. He is the king of well know he had a resign his kingdom ATC.","Allen Leverett","Yes, my assumptions would be Paul that since we will not have effective control of ATC even though we will have 60% economic interest. Since we will not have effective control because of the voting arrangement that we proposed, that we would still follow the equity method of accounting. So over in the asset set, you would have a statement already interest but I guess it's a majority interest in this case but you have a minority interest so you show you equity investment and you just take the earnings down.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","What's the board composition?","Gale E. Klappa","The board composition of ATC or the combined company?","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","ATC.","Allen L. Leverett","Well I guess when you say the composition let me back up and maybe just quickly go through the voting arrangement that we proposed. So what we proposed Paul is that the new combined company so this would be WEC Energy Group, WEC Energy Group would vote without limitation the 34% that Integrys Energy Group currently holds and then it would vote the remaining 26%, so that\u2019s the 26% the Wisconsin Energy holds now they would vote that in proportion to held the other shareholders vote. So in other words, Paul, we would be essentially in the same position that Integrys is today in terms of control, so that\u2019s how control would work and then you would vote for directors just like you vote for directors now and we will lead the position the same way as Integrys.","Paul Ridzon - KeyBanc","I think you went over this on the call when you announced the deal (inaudible) okay, thank you very much.","Gale E. Klappa","You are welcome. ","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Bischof with Morningstar Research. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa","How are you Andy?","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Good. How are you? Any new share repurchase in the quarter before you announce the Integrys acquisition and cancellation buyback program?","Gale E. Klappa","So there were nothing \u2013 there were no share repurchases in Q2.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Okay and Gale if I could ask your overall thoughts on the EPA\u2019s green power plant announcement in June (inaudible) Wisconsin Energy and your overall discussions with the state regulators so far?","Gale E. Klappa","Right, be happy to. Just to refresh everybody's memory, the environmental protection agency issued its proposed rule for CO2 reductions in essence from existing sources. And I believe the comment period now runs until October 16 of this year. Wisconsin's target and as you recall, each of the contiguous 48 states have been given separate CO2 reduction targets. And those targets were designed individually for each state by the staff of the EPA. Wisconsin\u2019s target 34% reduction.","Nationwide, the reduction target is 30% so we are just slightly above the national average. I think for many of us, while I will give the EPA very, very strong marks for creativity I mean they have never tried to tackle problem with this type of an approach before and they have really tried to give the individual states flexibility. But I don't personally feel like we were given credit for taking early action. I mean we have invested $9 billion in energy infrastructure since 2003 much of that has been either in modern and efficient generating units, renewables energy efficiency, other approaches that can and have reduced greenhouse gas emissions.","So if you look on our system, our green house gas emissions for the Wisconsin Energy are actually below the levels they were in 2000 and we just don't feel like we have been given credit for the early action and I think that's the standard view among of my counterparts in the industry. So we are going to be commenting on several things as we work our way through the comment period here one of which is we simply don't feel like the appropriate credit has been given for the early action and for the renewables that we have put in place, there is still lack of clarity which EPA admits around how they will treat biomass plants and of course in terms of emissions and of course we have almost $270 million investment we have just completed in our biomass plant that does meets the state's renewable portfolio standards.","And then one of the building blocks that the EPA has pointed out in terms of how states can try to flexibly meet the new target is to really run the combined cycle of natural gas fired power plants in the country up to 70% capacity factor. That is difficult in many parts not just Wisconsin but in many parts of the country, the natural gas infrastructure to achieve that kind of capacity factor for natural gas units is just not there. It's just not in place. So we think there are a number of comments that we want to make.","Overall though I still feel like we are quite well positioned as a company and the reason I think we are well positioned as the company is because of how efficient our new units are. Our units at Oak Creek which burn coal as you know, are among the top ten most efficient best log units in the country and one of the cleanest burning power plants literally in the world and our new natural gas unit at Port Washington, our new combined cycle units at Port Washington are the most efficient natural gas units in the Midwest.","So given the fact that they emit less ounce per CO2 or less ounce of CO2 per unit of output, I still think we are well positioned as anyone. I hope that helps.","Andrew Bischof - Morningstar Inc., Research Division","Excellent detail. I very much appreciate it.","Gale E. Klappa","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question.","Michael Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Hey Gale. Question for you little bit about natural gas demand. What do you think over the last year's weather normalize natural gas demand has been in Wisconsin and what do you think if anything the new normal maybe?","Gale E. Klappa","Okay. Well, levelized natural gas demand I would think it has gone up, it has got about 1% over the \u2013","Allen Leverett","It\u2019s about 0.5% to 1%.","Gale E. Klappa","About 0.5% to 1% what we have seen on weather normal basis. Where is it going? I am still in the camp but there is potential for it to go up however. In the last two years, we have had as I mentioned earlier some of the most abnormal weather both warm and cold that really stresses the weather normalization techniques that the industry applies number one. So that's one thing that I think the jury is still out on.","We need some more time to be able to determine whether a pattern of growth is stronger than we project. The other piece though is we are continuing to see in our state at any rate, a much quicker conversion of customers from propane to natural gas. You saw the statistics, or heard the statistics from our prepared script but I think we have got in terms of percentage of new customer connections for natural gas this year versus last year, we are up about 8.5%. So there are a number of competing factors here and moving pieces. I think it's still too early to tell whether or not we are in a stronger uptake patterns in terms of weather normalize natural gas consumption at retail. Again in states there are heavy propane users and Wisconsin I believe is the fifth heaviest state in the country in terms of propane use. We see some real potential opportunity.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Second, where does Illinois fall in that kind of realm when you think about potential for conversions and about local gas utility natural gas-related demand? Finally, and I'll knock them all out at once, of the $14 million in lower year-over-year O&M expense, how sustainable is that I mean when we look out to \u201915, \u201916 or \u201917, kind of multi-year out, is that a, hey, we're resetting the bar here to live within some of the regulatory kind of pieces of the regulatory agreement versus this is kind of a one-off?","Gale E. Klappa","Alright. Good question again Michael. Let me tackle your Illinois question first. I don't see much in terms of propane conversion opportunity in the Integrys Group companies in Illinois because it's really people's gas so that is downtown and city of Chicago and then north shore which again very-very close to city itself. So I don't see the kinds of propane conversion opportunities in Illinois that we are seeing in Wisconsin and I hope that answers that question.","And then I would also add in terms of the regulatory construction in Illinois for people's gas they are in a decoupled situation where we are not in Wisconsin. So, two different animals there and then in terms of O&M, in essence what a large chunk of and yes there are some sustainable productivity in cost reduction gains that we saw in the first half and that I think it will be permanent. But the line of share of $14 million of O&M cost reductions really came from lower medical and employee benefit expense and the reason for the medical we believe is that all of our employees switched as of January 1 of this year to high deductible plan. So the comparison maybe a little skewed in terms of medical costs, in terms of timing of when the company gets the medical cost flowing through. So we will see we will have a lot better picture in terms of medical cost and other employment costs, benefit costs, over the course of this year. The pattern maybe a little different this year and I suspect that it will be.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Meaning you think that O&M cost could be more backend loaded versus frontend loaded during the course of the year or I am not sure I totally follow you there.","Gale E. Klappa","Sorry. The answer to your question is yes, particularly as it relates to medical. And here is why, I think for an individual we have $2500 deductible and for a family I think it's $5,000. So that was not in place with our low-deductible plans last year. So we suspect that our medical expenses will be back end loaded this year compared to last year and so yes the answer is there maybe some additional medical O&M expenses coming through in Q3 and Q4.","Michael J. Lapides - Goldman Sachs","Got it. Okay. Thanks Gale. I appreciate it.","Gale E. Klappa","You are more than welcome. Take care.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line Brian Russo with Ladenburg. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa","Good afternoon Brian.","Brian Russo - Ladenburg","Good afternoon. Just curious, most of my questions were asked and answered but what were the drivers enabling your guys to beat your second quarter guidance of $0.50 to $0.52?","Gale E. Klappa","Well there are three drivers that I would point out and Pat and Scott can certainly add to that if they would like. The first we have talked about earlier which was O&M reduction. That's worth about excluding the merger cost, that's worth about $0.04 a share compared to last year. Then we have talked about the biomass tax credits and because of the accounting rules, there was a $0.03 of share hit in Q2 a year ago versus no hit in this year's second quarter. And then we had a lower effective tax rate which helped us by about a penny. On the negative side, there was a penny of merger cost and a penny of weather. So if you strip all that out, essentially those were the answers.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg","Right. There was O&M reduction ahead of your expectations I am asking because you have guided to $0.50 to $0.52 in the second quarter but you reported $0.58 so there is something exceeded your original expectations.","Gale E. Klappa","Yes absolutely. Pat, go right ahead.","James Patrick Keyes","So yes Brian, sorry. Some of the O&M we didn\u2019t expect. So medical was a little better than we thought. I talked about timing differences hurting us in Q3 in the guidance we actually got little help in Q2 versus what we have planned. I am going to write it off \u2013 start it with there is no one big answer, it's lots of cats and dogs I gave you two, here is a couple more. Gas sales came in a little better than what we had forecast probably because it was colder in the first half in the quarter and then the other income I talked about the land sells in the west park was something we didn\u2019t anticipate either. So lots of little things kind of added up to give us better than guidance.","Brian J. Russo - Ladenburg","Got it. Thank you very much.","James Patrick Keyes","You are welcome.","Operator","Your next question comes from the line of Tim Winter - Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead with your question.","Gale E. Klappa","How are you Tim?","Tim Winter - Gabelli & Co.","Good afternoon Gale. I just have a strategic question on ATC, so (inaudible) are the new hot thing and it looks like wind stream just got IRS approval to classify their transmission assets as real estate investment trust. Could you or is there any benefit that you guys have putting ATC in a retype structure?","Allen L. Leverett","Tim this is Allen I guess at this point and of course we are certainly open to things that would provide value for our shareholders. So if we found later that it was advantageous to put something in a different structure or some other which certainly be open. However, I think one big issue that we would have to face if I understand the restructure correctly; there is a requirement to payout I think more than 90% of your earnings in dividends well we have a company like ATC which has got a very-very healthy amount of growth in investments. If that company would have to payout say 90%+ in dividends they are going have to be very regularly in a position where they have to raise equity and I am not sure that that would be a good thing necessarily, a good position to be in. So that would a concern that I would have.","A second concern is how exactly would the provision for income taxes for that company be treated in FERC rate making. And so one of the benefits which you get with the REIT as you only have a single level of taxation, right? Well, I am not sure how you keep that benefit relative to our current structure if you have to give all that provision for income tax benefit back the customers. So at a high levels those would be the two concerns that I would have about the REIT structure but again Tim, you know if it ended up but at some point that was adventurous and certainly be very open to another structure, hopefully that make sense.","Tim Winter - Gabelli & Co.","Yes it does, thank you.","Allen L. Leverett","You are welcome, Tim.","Operator","Your final question comes from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with UBS. Please go ahead with your question.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Gale?","Gale E. Klappa","Hi Julian, how are you doing?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Dandy.","Gale E. Klappa","Glad to hear that.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. So let me cut back to that last question little bit and ask a little bit of a different ways. So there is the cost to capital is getting a bit competitively, how are you all feeling in your ability to compete for those planned acquisitions in the state and specifically I\u2019d be curious do you feel like you have any incumbent advantage as being in the state synergies or otherwise that would allow you to kind of outcompete anyone else who might be looking at those assets?","Allen Leverett","So your question is about the state power plant, it\u2019s not about ATC?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Indeed.","Gale E. Klappa","My guess is that minor movements in the cost of capital are not going to be a major impediment or a major benefit one way or the another. If the state does move forward with the selling the state owned steam and generating plants, I think they are going to be looking obviously for us competitive prices they can get but they are also going to be looking for the type of experience that I think we bring to the table. Again, these plants are providing pretty essential services to places like state owned hospitals to places like all the state capital, all the major universities and the system in Wisconsin and so I think there are going to be other factors, other than just pure price that will play into the winning bidder if the process does go forward. So experience and a track record are being able to operate these types of plants to improve the operations of the plants and to add environmental upgrade on time and on budget, I am confident it would a factor here.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent and then another high level conversation, coal rail deliveries continuing to hear commentary from other folks, where do you guys stand on that, anything to add to the mix?","Gale E. Klappa","Yes, we will let Allan talk about how tight things are right now.","Allen Leverett","Yes, most of our deliveries are from the Union Pacific although we do have a percentage wise a small amount from the Burlington Northern and a small amount from the Norfolk southern and we have had a lot of challenges really with all the railroads this year but particularly with the Burlington Northern. Some of that stuff is in their control, a lot of it is out of their control for example they had a lot of flooding of some the lines earlier this year but from inventory standpoint our coal inventories are pretty tight right now. We are not up to the levels that we would like them to be and we are not yet on the path to getting the levels that we want to be at in late September. So we certainly have and had to curtail operations of our plants. You may have seen some, in fact there was a news article this morning that a utility in Wisconsin is saying that they might actually have to shut down one of their coal plants because of the bad inventory situation. So it certainly not a level that would calls curtailment but it\u2019s something that I am focusing very much on with our group in terms of coal deliveries and it\u2019s something we would be happy to give you another update on when we have our call in October.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith - UBS","Excellent. Just cutting back to ATC, specifically, I'd be curious, any comments of late on both the competitive FERC process, there've been some tweaks in MISO. Do you feel better about the FERC 1000 process and then separately any commentary of late on the New England case as it relates to ATC?","Allen Leverett","I guess no change really on our view of the competitive. This is the order of 1,000 process I mean of course within our traditional footprint within Wisconsin and the UP of Michigan we still have right of first refusal on non-multi value project. So that\u2019s still there, we feel good about that and we feel good about our ability to compete for multi-value projects. But not a lot to add really on the process out east with the FERC ROE review, you know Julian the range of numbers that we had heard thrown out at the FERC low end was 10.57 return high end I believe it was 11 and three quarters and that compares to a current 12.2 at ATC so on a worse case basis, if ATC were taken all the way down to 10.57 that would be about a $0.04 per share impact on the combined company. So if you looked at the WEC Energy Group with the 60% ownership and ATC that would be about $0.04 impact at the low end, at the higher end 11 and three quarters it would be $0.01 a share. So still relatively nominal impacts but it\u2019s something will \u2013 it\u2019s not decided at this point and certainly.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Presumably you go back and get riders on top of that? ","Gale E. Klappa","Well that\u2019s uncertain. You are talking about incentives?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Yes, sorry incentives.","Gale E. Klappa","I don\u2019t believe so.","Allen Leverett","Well ATC has not gotten the incentive adder but they have gotten things like a full quip in rate base approach. So we traditionally have not gotten the \u2013 I will call it the incentive ROC which is one of the reasons why I think, we at least have shot that maintaining the 12 because we were never getting the incentive level.","Gale E. Klappa","And never asking for them really.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith \u2013 UBS","Right, absolutely. Great, well thank you very much.","Gale E. Klappa","Thank you very much. Well, ladies and gentlemen that concludes our conference call for today. Thank you so much for participating. Colleen Henderson will be available at our Investor Relations office, and her direct line is (414) 221-2592. Thanks, again, everybody. Take care."],"22036":["WEC Energy Group, Inc.

This call is being recorded for rebroadcast and all participants are in a listen-only mode at this time.","Before the conference call begins, I remind you that all statements in the presentation, other than historical facts, are forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties that are subject to change at any time. Such statements are based on management\u2019s expectation at the time that they are made.","In addition to the assumptions and other factors referred to in connection with the statements, factors described in WEC Energy Group\u2019s latest Form 10-K and subsequent reports filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated. During the discussions, referenced earnings per share will be based on diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted.","After the presentation, the conference will be open to analysts for questions-and-answers. In conjunction with this call, a package of detailed information financial is posted at wecenergygroup.com. A replay will be available approximately two hours after the conclusion of this call.","And it is now my pleasure to introduce Gale Klappa, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of WEC Energy Group.","Gale Klappa","Hot town, summer in the City. Good afternoon, everybody. Thank you for joining us today as we review our 2018 second quarter results.","But first, I know that all of you are interested in an update on Allen Leverett\u2019s recovery from the stroke that he suffered last October. Allen remains in very good physical condition, and he continues to be engaged in intensive speech therapy. He\u2019s really working hard. In fact, Allen has engaged in more than 700 hours of speech therapy in the past nine months and he has continued to make progress.","Now many of you have asked about our succession planning in the event that Allen can\u2019t or chooses not to return as CEO. As I mentioned to you on our last call, we conduct rigorous succession planning discussions with our Board on a regular basis and we\u2019ve done so for many years. So I can assure you that we have a solid plan B in place if Allen does not assume his previous role. The plan would involve a number of internal promotions. We would have continuity going forward, and the Board and I are very comfortable with what I call plan B. We will continue to monitor the situation during the third quarter of this year and we\u2019ll certainly keep you up to date on any new developments.","Now, I\u2019d like to introduce the members of our management team who are here with me today. We have Scott Lauber, our Chief Financial Officer; Jim Schubilske, our Treasurer; Bill Guc, Controller; Peggy Kelsey, Executive Vice President and General Counsel; and Beth Straka, Senior Vice President of Corporate Communications and Investor Relations.","As you saw from our news release this morning, we reported second quarter earnings of $0.73 a share. This compares with $0.63 a share for the second quarter last year. Our results were bolstered by effective cost management, stronger natural gas sales during a cool spring, and a warm start to summer that drove electricity use above our forecast. In addition, a stronger economy across the region resulted in slightly higher demand for energy from our industrial customers.","Scott will provide you with more details in just a few minutes. But I will say that one of the striking conclusions from our first-half results is the significant increase in weather normalized demand for natural gas, up 5.4% year-to-date.","Now let\u2019s take a brief look at the economic conditions in our region. Wisconsin\u2019s unemployment rate declined to 2.8% in May, a record low for the state. Unemployment ticked up slightly to 2.9% in June, but we have now recorded five consecutive months with the unemployment rate under 3%, and that folks has never happened before in Wisconsin history, and we continue to see positive economic development news across the state as well.","On June 28, Foxconn Technology Group held a groundbreaking ceremony for its $10 billion high-tech manufacturing campus that will be located in Racine County, it\u2019s just South of Milwaukee. Excavation work is already well underway. The plan is to move 4 million cubic yards of soil. And to put that in perspective, the soil removed from the excavation site would wrap completely around the equator if you pile the soil approximately one foot wide by one foot high. Next month, construction also will begin on the first building of this 22 million square foot project.","In addition, Foxconn has purchased an office building in downtown Milwaukee for its North American headquarters, and the company recently announced that it will expand its operations with innovation centers in Green Bay and Eau Claire, pretty cool stuff. And just this past week, the Wisconsin Commission approved the building of a new transmission line that will be needed to strengthen the network for a number of customers, including Foxconn in the Southeastern part of the state. American Transmission Company plans to invest approximately $117 million in the project.","I might add that, we\u2019re also making some very promising investments. On June 28, we announced an agreement to acquire an 80% ownership interest in the Bishop Hill III Wind Energy Center, that\u2019s located in Henry County, Illinois. The wind farm was developed by Invenergy, it was just placed into service in May.","Bishop Hill consists of 53 General Electric turbines with a capacity of 132 megawatts. Our 80% share of the investment will be approximately $148 million. The project has a 22-year off-take agreement with one of our current wholesale power customers, WPPI Energy. So this investment really is a logical extension of our core wholesale power business.","WPPI based in Sun Prairie, Wisconsin, has been a significant wholesale customer of ours for years. And we\u2019re pleased to extend that relationship with a new efficient renewable asset that exists within the MISO footprint.","Under the new tax rules, our investment in Bishop Hill will qualify for production tax credits and for 100% bonus depreciation. We expect our return on this investment will be actually higher than our regulated returns. We\u2019re projecting an unlevered internal rate of return above 8%.We filed for approval from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission earlier this month and expect a close on the investment in October. As always, we\u2019ll keep you updated as developments unfold.","And now for a brief update on our planned investment in the Upstream Wind Energy Center. Back in mid-June, you recall, we filed the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for approval to purchase an 80% ownership interest in this project.","As a reminder, the wind farm is located in Antelope County, Nebraska and consists of 81 GE wind turbines with a capacity of approximately 200 megawatts. Our share of the total purchase price is expected to be $280 million. The project has a long-term 10-year off-take agreement with an affiliate of Allianz, which as you know, is an A-rated publicly traded company. We expect to close on the purchase in early 2019 after construction is complete.","Now for those of you who follow the details of our capital investment plan, you\u2019ll recall that we\u2019re also proposing to add utility scale solar generation to our portfolio of regulated assets.","On May 31, our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary, along with Madison Gas and Electric, filed a joint application with the Wisconsin Commission to purchase 300 megawatts of solar generation at two locations. The Badger Hollow Solar Farm will be located in Southwestern Wisconsin in Iowa County and will be developed by Invenergy.","The Two Creeks solar project will be located in the City of Two Rivers, that\u2019s in Northeastern Wisconsin near the Point Beach Nuclear Power Plant. The Two Creeks project is being developed by NextEra Energy Resources.","Our Wisconsin Public Service subsidiary will own 100 megawatts at each site, with an investment of approximately $260 million. Pending regulatory approvals, construction for both projects is expected to begin next spring with commercial operation by the end of 2020.","Over the past few years, as many of you have followed, utility-scale solar has increased in efficiency and prices have dropped by nearly 70%, making it a cost-effective option for our customers an option that also fits well with our summer peak demand curve and with our plan to significantly reduce carbon dioxide emissions. As we continue to make these renewable investments and retire older less-efficient coal-fire generation, we expect to achieve our goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 40% well in advance of our 2030 target.","And today, I\u2019m pleased to report that we\u2019re taking our efforts a step further. We set a new long-term goal for carbon dioxide emissions. Our goal is an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions below 2005 levels by the year 2050. You can learn more about our plans to achieve that goal in our Corporate Responsibility Report, and we\u2019ll be releasing that report tomorrow morning.","Now an update on the outcome of tax reform in Wisconsin. In late May, we received a final written order from the Commission. For electric customers and We Energies, 80% of the tax benefit will be used to reduce the regulatory asset from transmission costs that we\u2019ve already incurred, but not yet build the customers. The remaining 20% will be refunded to customers in the form of bill credits.","For electric customers of Wisconsin Public Service, 40% of the tax benefit will be used to offset several regulatory asset balances and 60% will be refunded in the form of bill credits. For our natural gas customers in Wisconsin, the full amount of the tax savings will flow to customers through bill credits. We believe these were thoughtful, balanced decisions by the commission, Wisconsin customers began seeing their bill credits this month.","Now with these decisions, tax reform treatment in our largest jurisdictions has now been finalized, and all decisions across our four state area are in line with what we expected.","Turning now to Illinois, we continue to make real progress on the Peoples Gas System Modernization program. This program is critical to providing our Chicago customers with a natural gas delivery network that is modern, safe and reliable. We\u2019re on track to invest approximately $290 million in the effort during 2018. The overall project is now approximately 25% complete.","Now an update on our operations in Minnesota. In mid-October last year, Minnesota Energy Resources filed a rate case with the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Interim rates are currently in place and hearings on the case were held in mid-July. We expect the final commission decisions by year end.","I would add that we\u2019re also making excellent progress on our gas expansion project in the Rochester area, where the Mayo Clinic is growing rapidly. We\u2019ve completed the first phase of a multi-year plan to strengthen and expand our infrastructure for natural gas delivery, and the second phase installing a new high pressure system is on budget and well underway.","Next, we\u2019ll turn to Michigan. As a reminder, we obtain final regulatory approval last October for the construction of new natural gas-fired generation in the Upper Peninsula. Procurement is 67% complete and construction stands at 21% complete. Our plan is to bring the new units into commercial service by the second quarter of next year, that\u2019s 2019. And at that time or soon thereafter, we expect to retire our coal-fired power plant at Presque Isle.","We\u2019re investing about $266 million in 10 reciprocating internal combustion engines or as we call them RICE units. They\u2019ll be capable of generating a total of 180 megawatts of electricity. These units, which will be owned by one of our Michigan utilities, Upper Michigan Energy Resources, will provide a cost effective long-term power supply for customers in Michigan\u2019s Upper Peninsula.","And just one final note on the quarter. In May, Corporate Responsibility Magazine recognized us again for our environmental, social and governance practices, and named us one of the 100 Best Corporate Citizens in the United States.","Now with details on our second quarter and our outlook for the remainder of the year, another good corporate citizen, our Chief Financial Officer, Scott Lauber. Scott?","Scott Lauber","Thank you, Gale. Our 2018 second quarter earnings of $0.73 per share were $0.10 per share higher than the second quarter of 2017. These favorable results were largely driven by higher sales volumes and continued effective cost control.","Cooler than normal spring temperatures led to higher natural gas sales and electric sales were helped by a warm start to summer. We estimate that sales driven by weather and strong economy contributed approximately $0.07 to the quarter compared to our expectations, with approximately $0.04 of that related to whether.","The earnings package placed on our website this morning includes comparison of second quarter and year-to-date results for 2018 and 2017. My focus will be on the quarter beginning with operating income by segment and then other income, interest expense and income taxes.","Referring to page nine of the earnings packet, our consolidated operating income for the second quarter of 2018 was $330.8 million, compared to $362.2 million during the second quarter of 2017, a decrease of $31.4 million.","Excluding two tax items totaling $66.5 million, operating income actually increased $35.1 million. The first tax item reflects the benefit of tax repairs, which is part of our Wisconsin rate settlement; and the second item relates to the 2017 federal tax legislation. We have a breakout of these items for your reference on Page 7 and 8 of the earnings package.","Recall that as part of our Wisconsin settlement, we\u2019ve agreed to utilize the benefits of tax repairs to offset the growth of certain regulatory asset balances. The plan is proceeding as expected. And then regarding the benefits of tax reform, we currently project that the transmission escrow balance at Wisconsin Electric will be reduced from approximately $220 million to $40 million or less by the end of 2019. Excluding the impact of these tax items, operating income increased $35.1 million.","By segment update, we\u2019ll focus on this $35.1 million in operating income as shown on Page 9 of the packet. Starting with the Wisconsin segment, the increase in operating income, net of the tax-related adjustments was $22.6 million. Higher sales volumes rolled $26.4 million increase in margins.","In Illinois, operating income increased $1 million net of tax adjustments. The increase was primarily driven by continued investment in the Peoples Gas System Modernization program. The remaining increase in operating income in our Other States segment was about $4 million, largely driven by cooler than normal spring weather conditions.","Turning to our Non-Utility Infrastructure segment. Excluding the impact of tax reform, operating income at this segment increased by $6.3 million. Remember that this segment contains the operations of Bluewater Natural Gas Holding, which was acquired on June 30th of last year, as well as We Power. Bluewater Natural Gas Holding contributed $5.7 million to the increase in operating income in the second quarter of 2018.","The operating loss at our corporate and other segment was $6.5 million for the second quarter of 2018, an improvement of $1.2 million compared to the second quarter of last year. Combining these changes and excluding the two tax items, as I discussed, operating income increased $35.1 million.","Earnings from our investment in American transmission company totaled $28.7 million, a decrease of $13.1 million, as compared to the second quarter of last year. Excluding the $9.4 million impact from tax reform, our equity earnings decreased $3.7 million, driven by a charge recorded at ATC related to the final resolution of a FERC audit.","Other income net increased by $18.3 million quarter-over-quarter. This was due primarily to a decrease in the non-service cost component of our pension and benefit plans. Historically, this item was reflected in operation and maintenance and expense. However, a new accounting rule required it to be reclassified to other income in both years. Our net interest expense increased $6.6 million quarter-over-quarter, primarily by a continuing capital investment and higher interest rates.","Our consolidated income tax decreased $64.7 million. As previously discussed, lower tax expense was driven by the impact of tax reform and the flow through of tax repairs. We now expect our effective income tax rate will be between 15% and 16% this year. Excluding the benefits related to tax repairs, we expect the effective tax rate would be between 22% and 23%.","Now as you may recall, that we\u2019ve been expecting to become a cash tax payer this year. However, based on our latest forecasts, we don\u2019t expect to pay cash taxes until the end of 2019. This change is largely driven by the benefits of bonus depreciation from our investment in Bishop Hill and Upstream Wind projects. Combining all these items brings us to earnings of $231 million, or $0.73 per share for the second quarter of 2018, compared to earnings of $199.1 million, or $0.63 per share for the second quarter of 2017.","Looking at the cash flow statement on Page 6 of the earnings package. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $246.5 million during the first six months of 2018. Recall that we made $100 million contribution to our pension plan in the first-half of 2017. Higher earnings and a reduction in working capital also contributed to the increase in cash provided by operating activities.","Our capital expenditures totaled $915.5 million during the first-half of 2018, a $125.5 million increase compared to the same period in 2017, as we continue to execute on our capital plan.","Our adjusted debt to capital ratio was 51.5% at the end of the second quarter, a decrease from the 52.5% at the end of 2017. Our calculation continues to treat half of the WEC Energy Group 2007 Subordinated Notes as common equity. We are using cash to satisfy any shares required for our 401k plans, options and other programs. Going forward, we do not expect to issue any additional shares.","We continue to expect the FFO to debt to be in the range of 16% to 18%. We paid $348.7 million in common dividends during the first six months of 2018, an increase of $20.4 million over the same period last year. Higher dividends were driven by the 6.25% increase in the dividend level compared to the first-half of 2017.","Moving to sales. We continue to see customer growth across our system. At the end of June, our utilities were serving approximately 10,000 more electric and 15,000 more natural gas customers than they did the same time a year ago.","Retail electric and natural gas sales volumes are shown on a comparative basis on Page 13 and 14 of the earnings package. Overall, retail deliveries of electricity for Wisconsin and Michigan utilities, excluding the iron ore mine, are up 2.9% for the quarter and on a weather normalized basis, retail deliveries were up 1.7%.","Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin increased 18.2% versus the second quarter of 2017. This excludes gas used for power generation. Natural gas deliveries in Wisconsin grew 6.6% on a weather normalized basis. Weather normalized electric and gas sales volumes were above our expectations for the first-half of 2018.","Finally, an update on our earnings guidance. Due to our favorable year-to-date results, we\u2019re raising full-year earnings guidance to $3.32 per share, assuming normal weather for the remainder of the year, and we\u2019re reaffirming our long-term earnings per share growth of 5% to 7%.","As you recall, our long-term growth rate is based of the midpoint of our 2017 earnings guidance of $3.09 a share. We expect our third quarter 2018 earnings per share to be in the range of $0.68 to $0.70, that takes into account July weather and assumes normal weather for the rest of the quarter.","With that, I\u2019ll turn things back to Gale.","Gale Klappa","Scott, thank you very much. We\u2019re still standing and we\u2019re focused on delivering value for our customers and our stockholders. Operator, we\u2019re ready now for the question-and-answer portion of the conference call.","Question-and-Answer Session","Operator","Now we will take your question. The question-and-answer session will be conducted electronically. [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Greg Gordon with Evercore ISI.","Gale Klappa","Hey, Greg, how are you?","Greg Gordon","I\u2019m good, Gale. Cancel your Christmas plans, because it\u2019s Packers Jets 1 o\u2019clock on December 23rd in Middle Hansen [ph].","Gale Klappa","I\u2019ll be there.","Greg Gordon","A couple of questions. Can you talk a little bit about the success you\u2019ve had in executing these infrastructure investments outside the core utility? It strikes me that these returns look very good and that may be in part to a competitive advantage you have, because you\u2019re one of the few utility holding companies left with tax appetite, the table to actually transact on wind farms and consume those attributes, but then you also just articulated a slight move out and when you\u2019re a cash taxpayer, so can you just frame up why this is a good opportunity for you and you\u2019ve scoped it as sort of 8% of your total capital over the current five-year plan. Is there a chance that, that grows? Is that about where you think you\u2019re going to end up? That\u2019s my first question.","Gale Klappa","Yes, good question, Greg. I appreciate, you\u2019re asking. I mean, first of all, you may recall when we rolled out our new five-year capital plan late last fall, right before EEI Conference, we introduced this energy infrastructure category and we put about $900 million into that category out of an $11.8 billion total capital budget.","So, yes, it\u2019s roughly 8%, 9% of our total capital spending. Since then and given some of the impacts of tax reform given the fact that other companies in the industry are finding themselves in a position to sell assets, I think we do have a competitive advantage. I mean, first of all, our balance sheet is strong. We don\u2019t have to issue equity to finance this $11.8 billion capital plan, and we do have the tax appetite.","So when you look at the whole array of opportunities that we\u2019re seeing in the marketplace, actually Greg, the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing two of which we\u2019ve obviously just announced in the last couple of months, the opportunities that we\u2019re seeing to basically acquire high-quality assets that don\u2019t change our risk profile, those opportunities are greater than we thought they would be back last fall.","Again, it\u2019s a small percentage of our total capital budget when we roll out the new five-year plan this fall, I \u2013 if I were a betting man, I would think we would increase that the amount devoted to that particular segment a bit, but again keeping all this in perspective, we\u2019re being opportunistic with good high-quality assets here, but the driver, I mean, this is a great opportunistic situation for us, but the driver is still core investment in our regulated businesses. I hope that helps, Greg.","Greg Gordon","Yes, it definitely does. Thanks. And my second question is just with regard to the evolution of the Foxconn, the Foxconn project, you guys in your last sort of formal update said, you thought that would be a $10 billion project and create 13,000 direct jobs and about 22,000 indirect jobs throughout the state.","But when I talked to analysts who focus 100% of their time on the semiconductor industry, like there\u2019s just \u2013 there\u2019s a debate there as to what type of facility actually gets built, whether it\u2019s a facility that is a gen 6 fab or a gen 10 fab. And this corning going to co-locate our gas facility in the state or not, because that would be the gating factor towards the larger 10.5 facility.","So can you give us a sense of whether you\u2019re still confident that those round numbers reflect the commitment to dollars invested in jobs or whether there\u2019s some sort of a bid\/ask spread in terms of what they ultimately build in terms of what types of products they\u2019re building, whether it\u2019s smartphones or TVs and whether that means it\u2019s less jobs, more jobs, et cetera?","Gale Klappa","Yes, good, great questions, Greg. Let me answer it two ways. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve been very involved in this project personally, and within the last two weeks in a meeting with the Foxconn senior people, they strongly reiterated their commitment to a $10 billion investment and the hiring of 13,000 jobs.","They also, when President Trump came for the groundbreaking ceremony on June 28, they made a public commitment to a $10 billion investment and 13,000 jobs with the President standing right there. So what they\u2019re saying is that, the mix of products that they\u2019re thinking of producing here changes as their assessment of the marketplace changes.","So they may build something here different than their original projections at least that\u2019s what they\u2019re telling us. But in terms of their ultimate commitment of a $10 billion investment and 13,000 jobs, that remains staunchly unchanged and remains firmly in place.","And when you see the hundreds of millions of dollars that are already being spent and the gigantic amount of earth that\u2019s already being moved, I think, it brings all that to reality, right?","Greg Gordon","Great. That\u2019s very clear Thanks, Gale. Have a great day.","Gale Klappa","You too. Take care, Greg.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Julien Dumoulin-Smith with Bank of America.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Hey, good afternoon.","Gale Klappa","Greetings, Julien. How are you today?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Good. Thank you very much. So perhaps just to turn to the more regulatory side of things, can you discuss a little bit how the legislative mechanism passed in terms of settlements kind of changes your process in terms of the next rate case? I mean that both in terms of going into the next rate case filing itself, as well as just subsequently through it, just want to understand that legislation and what it means exactly a little bit more clearly?","Gale Klappa","I appreciate the question. And I think I would answer that in two ways for you Julien. First of all, it really does not change our fundamental approach to a rate filing or to discussions about a rate settlement. What I think the legislation does do is makes it easier and clearer for the Commission to accept a non-unanimous settlement, and that\u2019s the real key here in that legislation.","There was some debate when we went through the last rate settlement, as you recall, which we\u2019re now in a rate freeze going on four years. There was some debate about whether or not the Public Service Commission had the statutory authority to vote on and approve a settlement that was not completely unanimous among all the parties.","This legislation that was passed makes it clear that they can vote on and can decide on a settlement that is not joined by every single party. So I think that\u2019s the big difference that the legislation has enabled.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. All right. And turning back to a couple little of nuancy things. First, with what you\u2019ve mentioned to Greg here. The wind investment, just can you elaborate a little bit more as to why they\u2019re better? And also I suppose implicitly you continue to have appetite, given that you still have 20 onwards tax appetite?","Gale Klappa","And actually late 2019 onwards, yes. What Julien \u2013 why they\u2019re better than what?","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Well, the unlevered 8%, that sounds better than what you would get on a kind of traditional utility basis so\u2026","Gale Klappa","Oh, yes.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Okay.","Gale Klappa","No question. We\u2019re seeing in both these investments that we\u2019ve announced. We\u2019re projecting, given the contracts and the details of the contracts. We\u2019re projecting a better IRR\u2019s than you would see in a normal regulated investment. And also, because both of these wind projects are eligible for 100% bonus depreciation, the cash return is very significant.","So I think, again, given the overall conditions in the industry with a number of companies trying to repair their balance sheets, where we can be opportunistic because of the strength of our balance sheet in our tax appetite, we\u2019re seeing very solid projects that don\u2019t change our risk profile. And so we intend to continue to look very carefully at projects in front of us and be opportunistic with something that we think will benefit our shareholders with a portion of our capital spending. Scott, anything to add?","Scott Lauber","No, you hit right on the head, Gale. The tax appetite really does help bring that projects getting that cash back from bonus depreciation early on.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. And to that point actually, just to clarify this, I mean, the solar RTC, the commenced construction safe harbor, I mean, is that still too early to ask you about implications, given the tax appetite you all have and obviously your interest at least on the utility side for solar?","Gale Klappa","Well, it probably, if you think about the non-utility side, it probably gives us a little longer runway to look at projects. On the utility side, what we propose and what we will propose actually fits under the prior timeframe for the tax credits. So I don\u2019t think it would change anything on the utility side necessarily. I think, it gives us a little bit longer runway on the non-utility side if we make some solar investments on that \u2013 in that part of the business.","Julien Dumoulin-Smith","Excellent. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","Thank you.","Scott Lauber","Thank you, Julien.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Michael Weinstein with Credit Suisse.","Michael Weinstein","Hi, guys.","Gale Klappa","Michael, when do we get our gig on Fox Sports?","Michael Weinstein","I\u2019m ready to go. I\u2019m ready to move out there. Let me know when you\u2019re ready.","Gale Klappa","All right.","Michael Weinstein","Can you just talk about how much of the increase in guidance is due to weather and or one-time in nature?","Gale Klappa","I think, Scott gave you a nice quick breakdown of that in his prepared remarks.","Michael Weinstein","Yes.","Scott Lauber","Well, when you look at the weather for the quarter, I mean, the weather was about $0.04 and the rest is \u2013 was growth. So we raised the top end of the guidance, $0.02, really reflecting a combination of the growth that we\u2019re seeing and along with the weather. But we didn\u2019t raise it anymore than the $0.02, because we do have some projects \u2013 some maintenance projects that we\u2019re looking at for the fall this year, including some forestry and maintenance that was above and beyond last year, expenses and also a little headwind on fuel coming up.","Michael Weinstein","So that is why the guidance is still based on 2017, it\u2019s not really in the long-term guidance, right? It\u2019s not 2018 number, yes?","Scott Lauber","Yes, the long-term guidance.","Gale Klappa","And, Michael, I think, you can look forward, I mean, historically in the fall when we when we\u2019ve unveiled the new five-year capital spending plan. We also give you some sense of what our updating and rebasing our long-term earnings growth rate. And so I think, you\u2019ll see us do that on the next quarter\u2019s call as well.","Michael Weinstein","Great. And also the increase, the new goal of 80% by 2050, when can we expect to see that start to be reflected in forward capital plans?","Gale Klappa","Well, we already have \u2013 a very good question. We already have the capital plan in place that gets us probably by about 2023 to the 40% reduction. Remember, our first target was a 40% reduction below 2005 levels by the year 2030. The capital plan that we\u2019re executing now actually gets us there in terms of that 40% reduction by about 2023. So then heading toward a 2050 goal of 80% reduction, I think, you can start \u2013 we can start seeing some of that capital being injected into our plan 2024 and beyond.","Michael Weinstein","Okay, great. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Steve Fleishman with Wolfe Research.","Gale Klappa","Hi, Steve, how are you?","Steven Fleishman","Good, Gale. How are you doing?","Gale Klappa","Doing fine.","Steven Fleishman","I was curious your thoughts one of your neighboring utilities just worked out a deal, the Alliant deal doing an RO with NextEra with the nuclear. And you obviously have maybe somewhat similar situation with different circumstances. So could you maybe give or take on whether something like might make sense for you guys at Point Beach?","Gale Klappa","Sure, we\u2019re happy to. First of all, I think, you\u2019re right. The circumstances are a bit different between the two utilities. If you think about our power supply coming from Point Beach and right now we have a contract in place for all of the output of the two Point Beach units for the remainder of their lives, which looks like 2030 and 2033 for the two units.","So the first unit would retire in 2030, the second at the end of 2033. Those Point Beach units are producing about 22% of our total power supply for our retail customers. That\u2019s a very significant portion of our \u2013 of the energy we\u2019re delivering and, of course, it\u2019s carbon-free and it\u2019s dispatchable and basically runs, as you know, is a base load unit 24\/7.","So it runs and dispatches carbon-free energy regardless of whether the sun is shining or whether the wind is blowing. So it\u2019s a very important component today of our power supply and of our ongoing efforts to reduce carbon emissions. So you never say never in terms of doing a buyout like what our \u2013 one of our other utility friends has done. But at the moment, I don\u2019t see that in our future, in part, because it\u2019s a little bit different situation in terms of the magnitude of the power supply we\u2019re getting from Point Beach. I hope that respond Steve.","Steven Fleishman","Yes. That\u2019s great. And just want to go back to the prior question. So on your next quarter call, you plan to refresh the long-term capital plan and the long-term growth rate?","Gale Klappa","Yep, because I\u2019ll be right before the meeting, where we can dive into great detail with you and yes, that\u2019s our plan.","Steven Fleishman","Okay. Okay, thank you.","Gale Klappa","All tight. Thanks, Steve.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Praful Mehta with Citigroup.","Praful Mehta","Hi, guys.","Gale Klappa","Good afternoon. Hi, Praful, how are you?","Praful Mehta","Good. So I think you made a point on the call to talk about load growth or sales growth, especially on the gas side. So wanted to get a little bit more perspective on what\u2019s driving that?","And secondly, does that \u2013 is that a sustainable kind of growth level that would give you more headroom to kind of increase CapEx? How should we think about that?","Gale Klappa","Well, it\u2019s a great question. And it has been one of the positive upside surprises for us. Really, over the last three years, if you look at and we try to weather normalize, but you\u2019ve heard me say before, there are real deficiencies in how our industry weather normalizes sales.","So I\u2019m always reluctant to talk about one quarter of weather normalized data. But we now have 2.5 years of weather normalized data, which is showing real continued growth in gas deliveries and customer use of natural gas. I think, Scott, we were up like three 3.7% and then another 3.7%, so you talk about 2016 and 2017 being about 3.7% increases on a weather nornmal basis. And then as you\u2019ve heard Scott and me say, we had a robust growth in weather normalized demand in the first-half of this year.","So, it\u2019s very hard to tell whether or not that trend will continue, but clearly the trend has exceeded our expectations. And when you look at \u2013 and Scott and I really delve into this in great detail the other day. When you look at \u2013 to try to answer the question, what is driving this demand for natural gas beyond our expectations. And it\u2019s not just one sector, it\u2019s like every sector we looked at was green. Every sector we looked at was showing significant increases.","So that combined with customer growth, we\u2019re serving about 15,000 natural gas customers more than what we were serving at this time a year ago. So I don\u2019t want to be overly optimistic here. But what we\u2019ve seen for the last basically, 10 quarters, certainly would indicate that there\u2019s some other trend going on here, which we haven\u2019t seen before, driving natural gas usage higher.","Now what that means for capital spending? Obviously, we will take a hard look as we always do as we roll out our new five-year plan, and you may see some modest increase in capital spending on the gas side simply because of the infrastructure needs. And, for example, we\u2019ve already applied to the Wisconsin Commission for two projects, that would strengthen the natural gas delivery network in the Racine area, where Foxconn is and many others are now beginning project work.","We simply don\u2019t have a strong enough natural gas delivery network to handle all that demand in that part of the state. So there\u2019s another $140 million of capital already that was not in our previous forecast. I hope that\u2019s a long answer to your question. I hope it helps.","Praful Mehta","It\u2019s very helpful and a very interesting trend. So we\u2019d love to learn more on future calls as well. And for a second question, I just wanted to understand a little bit more on the taxes side. As you become a cash tax payer in that 2019 to 2020 timeframe, just wanted to understand what is the impact of the FFO? Like how much is the year-over-year impacted that point that you expect? And the reason for the question is, I\u2019m just trying to figure out the FFO to debt kind of trajectory impact of that change and how are you filling that gap? I\u2019m assuming there\u2019s something else that\u2019s helping to fill that FFO gap, so just a little bit of color on that would be helpful?","Scott Lauber","That\u2019s a good question. When you look in our assumptions are that we are partial taxpayers in 2019 and going forward, factoring all in the production tax credit. So we\u2019re still at that 16 FFO to debt or a little bit north of that. So if we find other projects to have additional tax savings that would just increase us or put us higher in the FFO range.","Gale Klappa","That \u2013 that\u2019s the net effect of additional projects.","Scott Lauber","Yes.","Gale Klappa","It raises basically from, say, 16, it raises a bit higher, which is a good thing.","Scott Lauber","If we can get some additional tax bonus depreciation projects?","Gale Klappa","Right.","Praful Mehta","Gotcha. And that\u2019s very helpful. Thanks, guys.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Shahriar Pourreza with Guggenheim Space.","Gale Klappa","Hey, Shah, somebody told me a rumor that based on one of your mentors, you were starting to take Thursdays off now. Is that true?","Shahriar Pourreza","I will not admit this on a public line. So thanks for taking my question. Just one quick round Foxconn and sort of the, obviously, the groundbreaking. The last discussions we had was, obviously, the potential for rooftop solar in the 100 to 150 megawatt range, and I think there was some discussions around whether it would be technically feasible and whether it would pass building codes. Is there any sort of updates that you\u2019ve had around with discussions around this potential?","Gale Klappa","Shan, what I can tell you and you\u2019ve got a great memory. What I can tell you is, we are still in active discussions with Foxconn about the configuration of their electric service \u2013 the basic elements of their rates and whether or not if there\u2019s any opportunity for solar. So continuing discussions, nothing new yet to report the continuing active discussions.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. And that depending on how the active discussions go, that\u2019s something that \u2013 would that be bid to an RFP process, or would that be something that would naturally come to you guys?","Gale Klappa","Well, I guess, there are two options. One would be a self billed by Foxconn, the other would be that we would basically make the investment. And again, too early to really give you a concrete answer at this point except other than everything\u2019s on the table and we\u2019re looking to how this best works for both parties.","Shahriar Pourreza","Got it. That\u2019s helpful. And then just on, is there any updates on incremental storage opportunities at the utilities?","Gale Klappa","Incremental gas storage opportunities?","Shahriar Pourreza","That\u2019s right, yes.","Gale Klappa","No, other than that energy infrastructure category that we\u2019ve developed, I mean, one of the range of options we look at for that category for potential investment is gas storage. But nothing new to report on that front today.","Shahriar Pourreza","Okay, terrific. Thanks. I want to go take the rest the day off. I appreciate. See you guys.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Jonathan Arnold with Deutsche Bank.","Jonathan Arnold","Good afternoon, guys.","Gale Klappa","Okay. Tell me Jonathan, you never take the day off.","Jonathan Arnold","Oh, well, no, maybe not the first day. So on the \u2013 just a couple of numbers questions that we wanted to chase down the other income line where you talked about the lower non-service overhead cost and it\u2019s affecting both years. It didn\u2019t seem like the 2017 number line changed this quarter whereas it did last quarter. So just trying to get a sense of how big was that driver and what else was going on in the $18 million there?","Scott Lauber","Yes, that\u2019s a good question. There\u2019s a lot of stuff that goes to the other income and deduction lying here. And unfortunately, some of these items are being reclass between O&M and this other line, so I guess, really confusing in. And when we manage the business, we really look at both of them together.","So last quarter what also goes through here is a couple of items that swing between quarters like we have an investment in some deferred funds out there like it\u2019s a rabbi trust for some deferred comp and that also fluctuates between quarters.","But year-to-date, this is \u2013 the reclass of this non-service cost for the pension was the biggest number about $10 million on a year-to-date basis. So there\u2019s a variety of items that go both ways, including some miscellaneous interest income and the deferral related to our forward wind farm.","When we put that into the rates in Wisconsin, we were allowed to defer a few of those costs to offset and unfortunately, that goes in this line also. So there\u2019s a mixture of stuff in there, but this was the biggest item for the quarter and for the year-to-date that really came out.","Jonathan Arnold","That pension drive you just said about $10 million year-to-date. Was that actually a change, or was it just the reclass?","Scott Lauber","It\u2019s \u2013 it was a reclass out of O&M down here. The benefits last year, a couple of items of why the pension is down. The fund did well last year. The assets grew. So their earnings are better this year. The interest expense is down a little bit. And we did combine some plans into the Medicare Plan A for some other post-employment retirements plans, so there was some savings there also.","Gale Klappa","Jonathan, what you\u2019re seeing in that category is a lot of accounting noise and we don\u2019t probably see that \u2013 you\u2019re going to see that every quarter. There\u2019s just so many items that swing around. And then as Scott said, the new accounting rule required us to reclassify as well.","So we try to spitball that for you as best we can. So that you can see what\u2019s going on. But it also masks \u2013 all of these things also masks how we\u2019re doing on, what I call, true operation and maintenance costs, and we\u2019re still on target there. We said we would expect about a 3% to 4% decline in 2018 over 2017 true O&M and we\u2019re right on target to achieve that.","Jonathan Arnold","Right, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then so just one other thing. You mentioned this, you have some ordered resolution at ATC. Was that a materialized? I mean, is it just this quarter or was this follow-on there?","Scott Lauber","It\u2019s just a very small item for the quarter here. We just \u2013 when you back out the tax reform stuff that was negative, I mean, you don\u2019t anticipate to be a negative. So it\u2019s about $3 million for the quarter.","Jonathan Arnold","Great. Thank you for that. Sorry for the detail.","Scott Lauber","No problem.","Gale Klappa","No, not at all. Good questions, Jonathan.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Paul Ridzon with KeyBanc.","Paul Ridzon","Good afternoon.","Gale Klappa","Hello, how are you?","Paul Ridzon","Can you hear me?","Gale Klappa","I\u2019m fine, Paul. How are you?","Paul Ridzon","Okay. Good. Just that last question. Is that \u2013 what period was that audit related to?","Gale Klappa","Well, it goes all the way back to 2004, I think, it was a long period of time. It was before the Internet. No I\u2019m kidding. So it was really, I think, 2004 up through like 2015 or 2016.","Paul Ridzon","And that was $2.7 million you said?","Scott Lauber","It was $3 million hit for the quarter.","Paul Ridzon","Okay. And then you said when you give us a new CapEx deck, we could see more non-utility infrastructure. Do you think that higher level would be incremental to your utility plan, or are you going to pull some utility back and add the higher return non-utility?","Gale Klappa","No, I think \u2013 but very good question. But what we\u2019re seeing in terms of the needed investment in our utility core infrastructure, I don\u2019t see us pulling that back, because those projects are needed. So no, I wouldn\u2019t see it diminish and if you will.","Paul Ridzon","Right.","Scott Lauber","We are not going to take capital spending plan away from the core utilities to move it into this particular category. So if anything there might be a bit of an upside, because I think what we\u2019re seeing here again in terms of our utility core investments, those are needed projects for reliability. So that would stay steady as she goes.","So you might see it, but I think you might see a bit of an uptick if the conditions we\u2019re seeing persist in the other category. And again, to keep all this in perspective, today, it\u2019s like 8% to 9% of an $11.8 billion capital plan. But I think, it again reflects the strength of the company that we can take opportunistic advantage of these kinds of good assets.","Paul Ridzon","How much more can you grow the CapEx without issuing equity?","Scott Lauber","Well, we\u2019ll take a look at it, but \u2013 and again, our plan is not to issue equity. But as your earnings grow and as you get bonus depreciation from some of these projects, it gives you some room.","Paul Ridzon","Yes.","Scott Lauber","And we track all the metrics that you talked about before FFO to debt and the holding company debt to total get around that 30%, so those are metrics that we\u2019re looking at.","Paul Ridzon","Just \u2013 I think you answered this one already, just want to make sure. Did you say you\u2019re going to rebase the 5% to 7% growth or reconsider the 5% to 7% growth?","Gale Klappa","No, rebase. I mean, right now our 5% to 7% long-term growth rate is based off, as Scott said, the midpoint of our 2017 original guidance. So as we move forward to another year on capital spending, we\u2019ll rebase our long-term growth rate off a newer number.","Paul Ridzon","But it\u2019s a 5% to 7% up for reconsideration?","Gale Klappa","Based on everything we\u2019re seeing, no, I think 5% to 7% will stay intact.","Paul Ridzon","Thank you for that clarification.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re welcome. Good questions.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of Andrew Levi with ExodusPoint.","Andrew Levi","Hey, Gale, how are you doing?","Gale Klappa","I\u2019m good, Andy. Are you Exodus or Xodus?","Andrew Levi","Exodus. I got to this from millennium, you know.","Gale Klappa","Yes. Oh, impressive, yes.","Andrew Levi","So as I listen, I mean, and obviously as I\u2019ve seen through last two quarters come in the raising CapEx, obviously, what you\u2019re saying about refreshing everything at EEIs. And also most importantly, in some ways looking at the top line growth and hopefully will continue into the third quarter. It sounds like at the very least when you rebase and I assume, I don\u2019t want to kind of preview that. But you\u2019re kind of be towards the high-end of your growth rate going forward, 6% to 7%. Is that the hope based on, especially if you do get that top line growth?","Gale Klappa","Andy, stay tuned and we\u2019ll be happy to discuss in detail on the next call.","Andrew Levi","Okay, I tried. Thank you.","Gale Klappa","Yes, you did a nice try, Andy.","Operator","Your next question is from the line of [indiscernible].","Gale Klappa","Jon, [ph] how are you?","Unidentified Analyst","Pretty good and congratulations. Great results. I wanted to know, again, is there some way that one can translate like the sales growth in the gas businesses, I would say, a tremendous? Is this some way to quantify that, say, 2% growth in sales in gas equates to this much in earnings growth? Is there some kind of rule of thumb that one can apply to convert the sales growth into earnings growth?","Gale Klappa","Yes. Generally, we can do that. But I would caution you and Scott can \u2013 I\u2019ll let Scott give you his rule of thumb. But I would caution you that we are somewhat earnings capped, because we have sharing mechanisms in place for all three of our Wisconsin utilities, including Wisconsin Gas. Wisconsin Electric has a gas component and Wisconsin Public Service has a gas component. So, all things being equal, we can give you a rule of thumb, but anything above our allowed rates of return, we properly share with customers.","So I would just throw in a word of caution in terms of just blindly using the rule of thumb, because again, we\u2019re in a promised area that, I think, is very healthy for everyone, where earnings above our allowed return of shares. Scott?","Scott Lauber","Yes. No, that\u2019s exactly correct, Gale. And when you look at sales \u2013 if you look at sales across all the sectors and you have about a 1% sales growth in residential, small commercial and transportation in Wisconsin, that equals to about 0.75% or $3 million pre-tax.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay.","Scott Lauber","So it\u2019s about $3 million pre-tax for 1% growth in all the sectors.","Unidentified Analyst","Okay. And so just on the point that you mentioned, Gale, sort of I\u2019m assuming this year, you would be based on this really strong start to the year, you would be setting mechanisms in all those territories. Is that a fair assumption?","Gale Klappa","Assuming normal weather and normal expenses that we\u2019re projecting going forward for the remainder of the year, yes, I would expect we would be in sharing in all three of the companies.","Unidentified Analyst","Thank you so much.","Gale Klappa","You\u2019re more than welcome. Great questions.","Operator","Your final question is from the line of Vedula Murti with Avon Capital.","Vedula Murti","Good afternoon, guys.","Gale Klappa","[indiscernible], Vedula How are you?","Vedula Murti","I\u2019m well. Thank you very much.","Gale Klappa","Good.","Vedula Murti","A couple of things. One, going back to natural gas question. I mean, over a period of time and I don\u2019t \u2013 and I think this is true in Illinois, but I wasn\u2019t sure about Wisconsin about how trends have moved towards wanting to keep moving increasing to a larger fixed charge, less variable charge and moving increasingly to a decoupled model.","And I\u2019m wondering right now if you can remind me how decoupled or undecoupled you are in Wisconsin, which is helping, I guess, the uplift here and whether, in fact, going forward as you go through various rate cases, whether you want to \u2013 whatever exposure you currently have, you would like to maintain, or whether you want to take this opportunity, in fact, to move even further into a decoupled scenario, given at least what we\u2019ve historically seen as long-term natural gas trends?","Gale Klappa","Vedula, let me kind of tackle that in two elements. First of all, we\u2019ll talk about our largest gas delivery jurisdictions, Illinois and Wisconsin. In Illinois, there has been a decoupling plan in place for many, many years and it works quite well. But Illinois is basically decoupled and I expect it will stay that way for decades to come.","In Wisconsin, we are not decoupled. And I really don\u2019t sense in terms of the regulatory backdrop here, any big appetite to move toward decoupling at all. And frankly, I think, the coupling can be a mixed bag.","First of all, getting the details of coupling right is a big deal. They\u2019ve done a good job of that in Illinois. Here, I think, the growth we\u2019re seeing and the growth we continue to expect to see, that growth really aligns the company and its business plan with economic growth.","So for Wisconsin, I think, we\u2019re going to continue to see the same type of regulatory environment and backdrop of the same type of regulatory treatment. I don\u2019t see us moving to decoupling certainly not in the next rate case.","Vedula Murti","Okay. And to follow-up on Jonathan Arnold\u2019s question about all those cumulative accounting noise issues and pension or OPEB, et cetera, if I looked at the release and everything correctly, I think, it was about $0.06, I think, at least, for this quarter if I\u2019m \u2013 if that\u2019s correct, that was a positive benefit. And I\u2019m just wondering how we then think about that as we roll forward in terms of either normalization or sustainable, whatever it is?","Gale Klappa","Scott?","Scott Lauber","Yes. When you look at that and when we really factored all that is \u2013 all that in, we were really looking at that as part of our O&M expenses and really consolidating it altogether. So the offset, when you do the math, it looks like O&M expenses is not down as far as you think and that\u2019s because some of these reclasses. So I really look at them together and I think together you have a good picture of where we are, we give the guidance and being down about 3% to 4%.","Gale Klappa","Yes, I think, Scott is right. We kind of have to piece through the details of these two pictures, put it all back together and we\u2019re still on track for about the 3% to 4% decline that we had projected in O&M expenses compared to last year.","Vedula Murti","And two other last things. One, in Illinois, if I\u2019m not mistaken, there\u2019s a ROE adjustment mechanism based on levels of interest rates. And can you just remind me how that works? Where you guys stand? And when it gets \u2013 how that gets refreshed if we go into a higher interest rate environment in the future? And then I have one last question.","Gale Klappa","Vedula, I\u2019ll suggest you save that question for Exelon, because in Illinois that, that rate adjustment tied to, I think, 10-year treasury rates applies only at this point in time to electric, not to natural gas.","Vedula Murti","Okay, that\u2019s good to know. And secondarily, in terms of the utility CapEx, the current plan for $11.8 billion, I think, you indicated that through the period there is no net external equity in that drip and everything like that is basically able to be funded internally. If we roll forward at kind of what level of CapeX does that then start needing to, at least, on the margin need to have some marginal incremental equity for rolling at a $11.8 billion over the current five years? I mean kind of where is it like the line where you start thinking you may need something, this is like 13, I\u2019m just making up a number, but I\u2019m just \u2013 want to kind of get a sense for that?","Gale Klappa","Well, we\u2019ll have a lot more detail for you on the next call as we refresh the capital plan. Remember though, some of the investments we\u2019re making now push out the timeframe in which we become a tax \u2013 a cash taxpayer. And some of these investments also give us 100% bonus depreciation.","So you really need to put all of the elements in there, and pretty soon it\u2019s Ragu and it\u2019s all in there. But I can tell you this. I think, we have some room because of the investments we\u2019re making for some increase in the capital plan over five years with no equity issuances in our plan is no equity issuances, no drip. We don\u2019t need it. The amount of outstanding shares we have today are going to be the outstanding shares we have tomorrow.","Vedula Murti","Thank you very much. And give my best to Allen, the next time [Multiple Speakers]","Gale Klappa","Sure. Well, thank you, Vedula. You take care.","Gale Klappa","Well, folks, that concludes our conference call for today. We really appreciate you participating. If you have any other questions, feel free to call at Beth Straka, and her direct line is 414-221-4639. Take care, everybody. Bye-bye."]}}
